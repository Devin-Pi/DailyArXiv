| **[ContextualStory: Consistent Visual Storytelling with Spatially-Enhanced and Storyline Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09774v2)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual storytelling involves generating a sequence of coherent frames from a textual storyline while maintaining consistency in characters and scenes. Existing autoregressive methods, which rely on previous frame-sentence pairs, struggle with high memory usage, slow generation speeds, and limited context integration. To address these issues, we propose ContextualStory, a novel framework designed to generate coherent story frames and extend frames for story continuation. ContextualStory utilizes Spatially-Enhanced Temporal Attention to capture spatial and temporal dependencies, handling significant character movements effectively. Additionally, we introduces a Storyline Contextualizer to enrich context in storyline embedding and a StoryFlow Adapter to measure scene changes between frames for guiding model. Extensive experiments on PororoSV and FlintstonesSV benchmarks demonstrate that ContextualStory significantly outperforms existing methods in both story visualization and story continuation.</p></details> |  |
| **[AS-LIO: Spatial Overlap Guided Adaptive Sliding Window LiDAR-Inertial Odometry for Aggressive FOV Variation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11426v1)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) demonstrates outstanding accuracy and stability in general low-speed and smooth motion scenarios. However, in high-speed and intense motion scenarios, such as sharp turns, two primary challenges arise: firstly, due to the limitations of IMU frequency, the error in estimating significantly non-linear motion states escalates; secondly, drastic changes in the Field of View (FOV) may diminish the spatial overlap between LiDAR frame and pointcloud map (or between frames), leading to insufficient data association and constraint degradation. To address these issues, we propose a novel Adaptive Sliding window LIO framework (AS-LIO) guided by the Spatial Overlap Degree (SOD). Initially, we assess the SOD between the LiDAR frames and the registered map, directly evaluating the adverse impact of current FOV variation on pointcloud alignment. Subsequently, we design an adaptive sliding window to manage the continuous LiDAR stream and control state updates, dynamically adjusting the update step according to the SOD. This strategy enables our odometry to adaptively adopt higher update frequency to precisely characterize trajectory during aggressive FOV variation, thus effectively reducing the non-linear error in positioning. Meanwhile, the historical constraints within the sliding window reinforce the frame-to-map data association, ensuring the robustness of state estimation. Experiments show that our AS-LIO framework can quickly perceive and respond to challenging FOV change, outperforming other state-of-the-art LIO frameworks in terms of accuracy and robustness.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Perfect Sampling for Hard Spheres from Strong Spatial Mixing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02450v2)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We provide a perfect sampling algorithm for the hard-sphere model on subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$ with expected running time linear in the volume under the assumption of strong spatial mixing. A large number of perfect and approximate sampling algorithms have been devised to sample from the hard-sphere model, and our perfect sampling algorithm is efficient for a range of parameters for which only efficient approximate samplers were previously known and is faster than these known approximate approaches. Our methods also extend to the more general setting of Gibbs point processes interacting via finite-range, repulsive potentials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Voting with Incomplete Voter Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08929v2)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider spatial voting where candidates are located in the Euclidean $d$-dimensional space, and each voter ranks candidates based on their distance from the voter's ideal point. We explore the case where information about the location of voters' ideal points is incomplete: for each dimension, we are given an interval of possible values. We study the computational complexity of finding the possible and necessary winners for positional scoring rules. Our results show that we retain tractable cases of the classic model where voters have partial-order preferences. Moreover, we show that there are positional scoring rules under which the possible-winner problem is intractable for partial orders, but tractable in the one-dimensional spatial setting. We also consider approval voting in this setting. We show that for up to two dimensions, the necessary-winner problem is tractable, while the possible-winner problem is hard for any number of dimensions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-Aware 3D Scene Generation with Spatially-constrained Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18159v2)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating 3D scenes from human motion sequences supports numerous applications, including virtual reality and architectural design. However, previous auto-regression-based human-aware 3D scene generation methods have struggled to accurately capture the joint distribution of multiple objects and input humans, often resulting in overlapping object generation in the same space. To address this limitation, we explore the potential of diffusion models that simultaneously consider all input humans and the floor plan to generate plausible 3D scenes. Our approach not only satisfies all input human interactions but also adheres to spatial constraints with the floor plan. Furthermore, we introduce two spatial collision guidance mechanisms: human-object collision avoidance and object-room boundary constraints. These mechanisms help avoid generating scenes that conflict with human motions while respecting layout constraints. To enhance the diversity and accuracy of human-guided scene generation, we have developed an automated pipeline that improves the variety and plausibility of human-object interactions in the existing 3D FRONT HUMAN dataset. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework can generate more natural and plausible 3D scenes with precise human-scene interactions, while significantly reducing human-object collisions compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. Our code and data will be made publicly available upon publication of this work.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient Sign Language Translation Using Spatial Configuration and Motion Dynamics with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10593v1)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT) converts sign videos directly into spoken language sentences without relying on glosses. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable translation performance in gloss-free methods by harnessing their powerful natural language generation capabilities. However, these methods often rely on domain-specific fine-tuning of visual encoders to achieve optimal results. By contrast, this paper emphasizes the importance of capturing the spatial configurations and motion dynamics inherent in sign language. With this in mind, we introduce Spatial and Motion-based Sign Language Translation (SpaMo), a novel LLM-based SLT framework. The core idea of SpaMo is simple yet effective. We first extract spatial and motion features using off-the-shelf visual encoders and then input these features into an LLM with a language prompt. Additionally, we employ a visual-text alignment process as a warm-up before the SLT supervision. Our experiments demonstrate that SpaMo achieves state-of-the-art performance on two popular datasets, PHOENIX14T and How2Sign.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Spatial Knockoff Bayesian Variable Selection in Genome-Wide Association Studies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10401v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional variable selection has emerged as one of the prevailing statistical challenges in the big data revolution. Many variable selection methods have been adapted for identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to phenotypic variation in genome-wide association studies. We develop a Bayesian variable selection regression model for identifying SNPs linked to phenotypic variation. We modify our Bayesian variable selection regression models to control the false discovery rate of SNPs using a knockoff variable approach. We reduce spurious associations by regressing the phenotype of interest against a set of basis functions that account for the relatedness of individuals. Using a restricted regression approach, we simultaneously estimate the SNP-level effects while removing variation in the phenotype that can be explained by population structure. We also accommodate the spatial structure among causal SNPs by modeling their inclusion probabilities jointly with a reduced rank Gaussian process. In a simulation study, we demonstrate that our spatial Bayesian variable selection regression model controls the false discovery rate and increases power when the relevant SNPs are clustered. We conclude with an analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana flowering time, a polygenic trait that is confounded with population structure, and find the discoveries of our method cluster near described flowering time genes.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages and 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Highly Multivariate High-dimensionality Spatial Stochastic Processes-A Mixed Conditional Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10396v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a hybrid mixed spatial graphical model framework and novel concepts, e.g., cross-Markov Random Field (cross-MRF), to comprehensively address all feature aspects of highly multivariate high-dimensionality (HMHD) spatial data class when constructing the desired joint variance and precision matrix (where both p and n are large). Specifically, the framework accommodates any customized conditional independence (CI) among any number of p variate fields at the first stage, alleviating dynamic memory burden. Meanwhile, it facilitates parallel generation of covariance and precision matrix, with the latter's generation order scaling only linearly in p. In the second stage, we demonstrate the multivariate Hammersley-Clifford theorem from a column-wise conditional perspective and unearth the existence of cross-MRF. The link of the mixed spatial graphical framework and the cross-MRF allows for a mixed conditional approach, resulting in the sparsest possible representation of the precision matrix via accommodating the doubly CI among both p and n, with the highest possible exact-zero-value percentage. We also explore the possibility of the co-existence of geostatistical and MRF modelling approaches in one unified framework, imparting a potential solution to an open problem. The derived theories are illustrated with 1D simulation and 2D real-world spatial data.</p></details> | 46 pages; 11 figures |
| **[Spatial-Frequency Dual Progressive Attention Network For Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07952v2)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In medical images, various types of lesions often manifest significant differences in their shape and texture. Accurate medical image segmentation demands deep learning models with robust capabilities in multi-scale and boundary feature learning. However, previous networks still have limitations in addressing the above issues. Firstly, previous networks simultaneously fuse multi-level features or employ deep supervision to enhance multi-scale learning. However, this may lead to feature redundancy and excessive computational overhead, which is not conducive to network training and clinical deployment. Secondly, the majority of medical image segmentation networks exclusively learn features in the spatial domain, disregarding the abundant global information in the frequency domain. This results in a bias towards low-frequency components, neglecting crucial high-frequency information. To address these problems, we introduce SF-UNet, a spatial-frequency dual-domain attention network. It comprises two main components: the Multi-scale Progressive Channel Attention (MPCA) block, which progressively extract multi-scale features across adjacent encoder layers, and the lightweight Frequency-Spatial Attention (FSA) block, with only 0.05M parameters, enabling concurrent learning of texture and boundary features from both spatial and frequency domains. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed SF-UNet on three public datasets. Experimental results show that compared to previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) medical image segmentation networks, SF-UNet achieves the best performance, and achieves up to 9.4\% and 10.78\% improvement in DSC and IOU. Codes will be released at https://github.com/nkicsl/SF-UNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages accepted by 2024 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Regional and spatial dependence of poverty factors in Thailand, and its use into Bayesian hierarchical regression analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09760v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Poverty is a serious issue that harms humanity progression. The simplest solution is to use one-shirt-size policy to alleviate it. Nevertheless, each region has its unique issues, which require a unique solution to solve them. In the aspect of spatial analysis, neighbor regions can provide useful information to analyze issues of a given region. In this work, we proposed inferred boundaries of regions of Thailand that can explain better the poverty dynamics, instead of the usual government administrative regions. The proposed regions maximize a trade-off between poverty-related features and geographical coherence. We use a spatial analysis together with Moran's cluster algorithms and Bayesian hierarchical regression models, with the potential of assist the implementation of the right policy to alleviate the poverty phenomenon. We found that all variables considered show a positive spatial autocorrelation. The results of analysis illustrate that 1) Northern, Northeastern Thailand, and in less extend Northcentral Thailand are the regions that require more attention in the aspect of poverty issues, 2) Northcentral, Northeastern, Northern and Southern Thailand present dramatically low levels of education, income and amount of savings contrasted with large cities such as Bangkok-Pattaya and Central Thailand, and 3) Bangkok-Pattaya is the only region whose average years of education is above 12 years, which corresponds (approx.) with a complete senior high school.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes to reproduce our results are available in https://github.com/IrvingGomez/SpatialPovertyFactors</p></details> |
| **[Spatial Path Index Modulation in mmWave/THz-Band Integrated Sensing and Communications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12328v2)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the demand for wireless connectivity continues to soar, the fifth generation and beyond wireless networks are exploring new ways to efficiently utilize the wireless spectrum and reduce hardware costs. One such approach is the integration of sensing and communications (ISAC) paradigms to jointly access the spectrum. Recent ISAC studies have focused on upper millimeter-wave and low terahertz bands to exploit ultrawide bandwidths. At these frequencies, hybrid beamformers that employ fewer radio-frequency chains are employed to offset expensive hardware but at the cost of lower multiplexing gains. Wideband hybrid beamforming also suffers from the beam-split effect arising from the subcarrier-independent (SI) analog beamformers. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a spatial path index modulation (SPIM) ISAC architecture, which transmits additional information bits via modulating the spatial paths between the base station and communications users. We design the SPIM-ISAC beamformers by first estimating both radar and communications parameters by developing beam-split-aware algorithms. Then, we propose to employ a family of hybrid beamforming techniques such as hybrid, SI, and subcarrier-dependent analog-only, and beam-split-aware beamformers. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed SPIM-ISAC approach exhibits significantly improved spectral efficiency performance in the presence of beam-split than that of even fully digital non-SPIM beamformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted Paper in IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications</p></details> |
| **[Auptimize: Optimal Placement of Spatial Audio Cues for Extended Reality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09320v1)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial audio in Extended Reality (XR) provides users with better awareness of where virtual elements are placed, and efficiently guides them to events such as notifications, system alerts from different windows, or approaching avatars. Humans, however, are inaccurate in localizing sound cues, especially with multiple sources due to limitations in human auditory perception such as angular discrimination error and front-back confusion. This decreases the efficiency of XR interfaces because users misidentify from which XR element a sound is coming. To address this, we propose Auptimize, a novel computational approach for placing XR sound sources, which mitigates such localization errors by utilizing the ventriloquist effect. Auptimize disentangles the sound source locations from the visual elements and relocates the sound sources to optimal positions for unambiguous identification of sound cues, avoiding errors due to inter-source proximity and front-back confusion. Our evaluation shows that Auptimize decreases spatial audio-based source identification errors compared to playing sound cues at the paired visual-sound locations. We demonstrate the applicability of Auptimize for diverse spatial audio-based interactive XR scenarios.</p></details> | UIST 2024 |
| **[A Study of PHOC Spatial Region Configurations for Math Formula Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09283v1)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A Pyramidal Histogram Of Characters (PHOC) represents the spatial location of symbols as binary vectors. The vectors are composed of levels that split a formula into equal-sized regions of one or more types (e.g., rectangles or ellipses). For each region type, this produces a pyramid of overlapping regions, where the first level contains the entire formula, and the final level the finest-grained regions. In this work, we introduce concentric rectangles for regions, and analyze whether subsequent PHOC levels encode redundant information by omitting levels from PHOC configurations. As a baseline, we include a bag of words PHOC containing only the first whole-formula level. Finally, using the ARQMath-3 formula retrieval benchmark, we demonstrate that some levels encoded in the original PHOC configurations are redundant, that PHOC models with rectangular regions outperform earlier PHOC models, and that despite their simplicity, PHOC models are surprisingly competitive with the state-of-the-art. PHOC is not math-specific, and might be used for chemical diagrams, charts, or other graphics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Social VR for Professional Networking: A Spatial Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09280v1)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One essential function of professional events, such as industry trade shows and academic conferences, is to foster and extend a person's connections to others within the community of their interest. In this paper, we delve into the emerging practice transitioning these events from physical venues to social VR as a new medium. Specifically, we ask: how does the spatial design in social VR affect the attendee's networking behaviors and experiences at these events? To answer this question, we conducted in-situ observations and in-depth interviews with 13 participants. Each of them had attended or hosted at least one real-world professional event taking place in social VR. We identified four elements of VR spatial design that shaped social interactions at these events: area size, which influenced a person's perceived likelihood of encountering others; pathways connecting areas, which guided their planning of the next activity to perform; magnets in areas, which facilitated spontaneous gatherings among people; and conventionality, which affected the assessment of a person's behavior appropriateness. Some of these elements were interpreted differently depending on the role of the participant, i.e., event hosts vs. attendees. We concluded this paper with multiple design implications derived from our findings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Linear Attention is Enough in Spatial-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09158v1)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the most representative scenario of spatial-temporal forecasting tasks, the traffic forecasting task attracted numerous attention from machine learning community due to its intricate correlation both in space and time dimension. Existing methods often treat road networks over time as spatial-temporal graphs, addressing spatial and temporal representations independently. However, these approaches struggle to capture the dynamic topology of road networks, encounter issues with message passing mechanisms and over-smoothing, and face challenges in learning spatial and temporal relationships separately. To address these limitations, we propose treating nodes in road networks at different time steps as independent spatial-temporal tokens and feeding them into a vanilla Transformer to learn complex spatial-temporal patterns, design STformer achieving SOTA. Given its quadratic complexity, we introduce a variant NSTformer based on Nystr$\ddot{o}$m method to approximate self-attention with linear complexity but even slightly better than former in a few cases astonishingly. Extensive experimental results on traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance at an affordable computational cost. Our code will be made available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Principal Component Analysis and Moran Statistics for Multivariate Functional Areal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08630v1)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we present the bivariate and multivariate functional Moran's I statistics and multivariate functional areal spatial principal component analysis (mfasPCA). These methods are the first of their kind in the field of multivariate areal spatial functional data analysis. The multivariate functional Moran's I statistic is employed to assess spatial autocorrelation, while mfasPCA is utilized for dimension reduction in both univariate and multivariate functional areal data. Through simulation studies and real-world examples, we demonstrate that the multivariate functional Moran's I statistic and mfasPCA are powerful tools for evaluating spatial autocorrelation in univariate and multivariate functional areal data analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Modeling of Incompatible Spatial Data: A Case Study Involving Post-Adrian Storm Forest Damage Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11256v2)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling incompatible spatial data, i.e., data with different spatial resolutions, is a pervasive challenge in remote sensing data analysis. Typical approaches to addressing this challenge aggregate information to a common coarse resolution, i.e., compatible resolutions, prior to modeling. Such pre-processing aggregation simplifies analysis, but potentially causes information loss and hence compromised inference and predictive performance. To avoid losing potential information provided by finer spatial resolution data and improve predictive performance, we propose a new Bayesian method that constructs a latent spatial process model at the finest spatial resolution. This model is tailored to settings where the outcome variable is measured on a coarser spatial resolution than predictor variables -- a configuration seen increasingly when high spatial resolution remotely sensed predictors are used in analysis. A key contribution of this work is an efficient algorithm that enables full Bayesian inference using finer resolution data while optimizing computational and storage costs. The proposed method is applied to a forest damage assessment for the 2018 Adrian storm in Carinthia, Austria, that uses high-resolution laser imaging detection and ranging (LiDAR) measurements and relatively coarse resolution forest inventory measurements. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate the proposed approach substantially improves inference for small prediction units.</p></details> | 27 pages, 8 figures |

Considering a data deficiency and constrained computational resource scenario, this paper proposes a novel parameter-efficient transfer learning framework for vision recognition models in the black-box setting. Our framework incorporates two novel training techniques. First, we align the input space (i.e., image) of PTMs to the target data distribution by generating visual prompts of spatial and frequency domain. Along with the novel spatial-frequency hybrid visual prompter, we design a novel training technique based on probabilistic clusters, which can enhance class separation in the output space (i.e., prediction probabilities). In experiments, our model demonstrates superior performance in a few-shot transfer learning setting across extensive visual recognition datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, we show that the proposed method efficiently reduces computational costs for training and inference phases.</p></details> | ACM Multimedia 2024 |
| **[Narrowing your FOV with SOLiD: Spatially Organized and Lightweight Global Descriptor for FOV-constrained LiDAR Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07330v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We often encounter limited FOV situations due to various factors such as sensor fusion or sensor mount in real-world robot navigation. However, the limited FOV interrupts the generation of descriptions and impacts place recognition adversely. Therefore, we suffer from correcting accumulated drift errors in a consistent map using LiDAR-based place recognition with limited FOV. Thus, in this paper, we propose a robust LiDAR-based place recognition method for handling narrow FOV scenarios. The proposed method establishes spatial organization based on the range-elevation bin and azimuth-elevation bin to represent places. In addition, we achieve a robust place description through reweighting based on vertical direction information. Based on these representations, our method enables addressing rotational changes and determining the initial heading. Additionally, we designed a lightweight and fast approach for the robot's onboard autonomy. For rigorous validation, the proposed method was tested across various LiDAR place recognition scenarios (i.e., single-session, multi-session, and multi-robot scenarios). To the best of our knowledge, we report the first method to cope with the restricted FOV. Our place description and SLAM codes will be released. Also, the supplementary materials of our descriptor are available at \texttt{\url{https://sites.google.com/view/lidar-solid}}.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (2024)</p></details> |
| **[Camera Perspective Transformation to Bird's Eye View via Spatial Transformer Model for Road Intersection Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05577v2)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Road intersection monitoring and control research often utilize bird's eye view (BEV) simulators. In real traffic settings, achieving a BEV akin to that in a simulator necessitates the deployment of drones or specific sensor mounting, which is neither feasible nor practical. Consequently, traffic intersection management remains confined to simulation environments given these constraints. In this paper, we address the gap between simulated environments and real-world implementation by introducing a novel deep-learning model that converts a single camera's perspective of a road intersection into a BEV. We created a simulation environment that closely resembles a real-world traffic junction. The proposed model transforms the vehicles into BEV images, facilitating road intersection monitoring and control model processing. Inspired by image transformation techniques, we propose a Spatial-Transformer Double Decoder-UNet (SDD-UNet) model that aims to eliminate the transformed image distortions. In addition, the model accurately estimates the vehicle's positions and enables the direct application of simulation-trained models in real-world contexts. SDD-UNet model achieves an average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) above 95% which is 40% better than the original UNet model. The mean absolute error (MAE) is 0.102 and the centroid of the predicted mask is 0.14 meters displaced, on average, indicating high accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Most existing performance assessments of LLMs for spatial tasks have primarily focused on ChatGPT, whereas other chatbots received less attention. To narrow this research gap, this study conducts a zero-shot correctness evaluation for a set of 76 spatial tasks across seven task categories assigned to four prominent chatbots, i.e., ChatGPT-4, Gemini, Claude-3, and Copilot. The chatbots generally performed well on tasks related to spatial literacy, GIS theory, and interpretation of programming code and functions, but revealed weaknesses in mapping, code writing, and spatial reasoning. Furthermore, there was a significant difference in correctness of results between the four chatbots. Responses from repeated tasks assigned to each chatbot showed a high level of consistency in responses with matching rates of over 80% for most task categories in the four chatbots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions in GIS</p></details> |

While supervised methods demonstrate proficiency, their reliance on extensive pixel-level annotations limits scalability. We introduce DynaSeg, an innovative unsupervised image segmentation approach that overcomes the challenge of balancing feature similarity and spatial continuity without relying on extensive hyperparameter tuning. Unlike traditional methods, DynaSeg employs a dynamic weighting scheme that automates parameter tuning, adapts flexibly to image characteristics, and facilitates easy integration with other segmentation networks. By incorporating a Silhouette Score Phase, DynaSeg prevents undersegmentation failures where the number of predicted clusters might converge to one. DynaSeg uses CNN-based and pre-trained ResNet feature extraction, making it computationally efficient and more straightforward than other complex models. Experimental results showcase state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 12.2% and 14.12% mIOU improvement over current unsupervised segmentation approaches on COCO-All and COCO-Stuff datasets, respectively. We provide qualitative and quantitative results on five benchmark datasets, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed approach.Code is available at https://github.com/RyersonMultimediaLab/DynaSeg</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Press: Image and Vision Computing Journal</p></details> |

Recent studies are primarily dedicated to designing Transformer-based architectures for spatial-spectral long-range dependencies modeling, which is computationally expensive with quadratic complexity. Selective structured state space model (Mamba), which is efficient for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, has recently shown promising progress. However, its potential in hyperspectral image processing that requires handling numerous spectral bands has not yet been explored. In this paper, we innovatively propose S$^2$Mamba, a spatial-spectral state space model for hyperspectral image classification, to excavate spatial-spectral contextual features, resulting in more efficient and accurate land cover analysis. In S$^2$Mamba, two selective structured state space models through different dimensions are designed for feature extraction, one for spatial, and the other for spectral, along with a spatial-spectral mixture gate for optimal fusion. More specifically, S$^2$Mamba first captures spatial contextual relations by interacting each pixel with its adjacent through a Patch Cross Scanning module and then explores semantic information from continuous spectral bands through a Bi-directional Spectral Scanning module. Considering the distinct expertise of the two attributes in homogenous and complicated texture scenes, we realize the Spatial-spectral Mixture Gate by a group of learnable matrices, allowing for the adaptive incorporation of representations learned across different dimensions. Extensive experiments conducted on HSI classification benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and prospect of S$^2$Mamba. The code will be made available at: https://github.com/PURE-melo/S2Mamba.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Automatic Spatial Calibration of Near-Field MIMO Radar With Respect to Optical Depth Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10981v2)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite an emerging interest in MIMO radar, the utilization of its complementary strengths in combination with optical depth sensors has so far been limited to far-field applications, due to the challenges that arise from mutual sensor calibration in the near field. In fact, most related approaches in the autonomous industry propose target-based calibration methods using corner reflectors that have proven to be unsuitable for the near field. In contrast, we propose a novel, joint calibration approach for optical RGB-D sensors and MIMO radars that is designed to operate in the radar's near-field range, within decimeters from the sensors. Our pipeline consists of a bespoke calibration target, allowing for automatic target detection and localization, followed by the spatial calibration of the two sensor coordinate systems through target registration. We validate our approach using two different depth sensing technologies from the optical domain. The experiments show the efficiency and accuracy of our calibration for various target displacements, as well as its robustness of our localization in terms of signal ambiguities.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures, accepted to IROS 2024</p></details> |

However, its potential in the domain of multi-frame 3D object detection remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present STEMD, a novel end-to-end framework that enhances the DETR-like paradigm for multi-frame 3D object detection by addressing three key aspects specifically tailored for this task. First, to model the inter-object spatial interaction and complex temporal dependencies, we introduce the spatial-temporal graph attention network, which represents queries as nodes in a graph and enables effective modeling of object interactions within a social context. To solve the problem of missing hard cases in the proposed output of the encoder in the current frame, we incorporate the output of the previous frame to initialize the query input of the decoder. Finally, it poses a challenge for the network to distinguish between the positive query and other highly similar queries that are not the best match. And similar queries are insufficiently suppressed and turn into redundant prediction boxes. To address this issue, our proposed IoU regularization term encourages similar queries to be distinct during the refinement. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling challenging scenarios, while incurring only a minor additional computational overhead. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Eaphan/STEMD.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures; Accepted by IEEE TPAMI</p></details> |

Rendering Spatial Information of Static and Moving Objects in VR via Haptic Feedback for Blind People](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06550v1)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perceiving spatial information of a virtual object (e.g., direction, distance) is critical yet challenging for blind users seeking an immersive virtual reality experience. To facilitate VR accessibility for blind users, in this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of two types of haptic cues--vibrotactile and skin-stretch cues--in conveying the spatial information of a virtual object when applied to the dorsal side of a blind user's hand. We conducted a user study with 10 blind users to investigate how they perceive static and moving objects in VR with a custom-made haptic apparatus. Our results reveal that blind users can more accurately understand an object's location and movement when receiving skin-stretch cues, as opposed to vibrotactile cues. We discuss the pros and cons of both types of haptic cues and conclude with design recommendations for future haptic solutions for VR accessibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Dynamical Operator: Continuous Spatial-Temporal Model with Gradient-Based and Derivative-Free Optimization Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11798v3)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven modeling techniques have been explored in the spatial-temporal modeling of complex dynamical systems for many engineering applications. However, a systematic approach is still lacking to leverage the information from different types of data, e.g., with different spatial and temporal resolutions, and the combined use of short-term trajectories and long-term statistics. In this work, we build on the recent progress of neural operator and present a data-driven modeling framework called neural dynamical operator that is continuous in both space and time. A key feature of the neural dynamical operator is the resolution-invariance with respect to both spatial and temporal discretizations, without demanding abundant training data in different temporal resolutions. To improve the long-term performance of the calibrated model, we further propose a hybrid optimization scheme that leverages both gradient-based and derivative-free optimization methods and efficiently trains on both short-term time series and long-term statistics. We investigate the performance of the neural dynamical operator with three numerical examples, including the viscous Burgers' equation, the Navier-Stokes equations, and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. The results confirm the resolution-invariance of the proposed modeling framework and also demonstrate stable long-term simulations with only short-term time series data. In addition, we show that the proposed model can better predict long-term statistics via the hybrid optimization scheme with a combined use of short-term and long-term data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Powerful Spatial Multiple Testing via Borrowing Neighboring Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17121v2)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clustered effects are often encountered in multiple hypothesis testing of spatial signals. In this paper, we propose a new method, termed \textit{two-dimensional spatial multiple testing} (2d-SMT) procedure, to control the false discovery rate (FDR) and improve the detection power by exploiting the spatial information encoded in neighboring observations. The proposed method provides a novel perspective of utilizing spatial information by gathering signal patterns and spatial dependence into an auxiliary statistic. 2d-SMT rejects the null when a primary statistic at the location of interest and the auxiliary statistic constructed based on nearby observations are greater than their corresponding cutoffs. 2d-SMT can also be combined with different variants of the weighted BH procedures to improve the detection power further. A fast algorithm is developed to accelerate the search for optimal cutoffs in 2d-SMT. In theory, we establish the asymptotic FDR control of 2d-SMT under weak spatial dependence. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the 2d-SMT method combined with various weighted BH procedures achieves the most competitive performance in FDR and power trade-off.</p></details> | 35 pages |

Despite the improvement brought by the strong visual backbone in extracting spatial features, CLIP still falls short in capturing and integrating spatial-temporal features which is essential for video recognition. In this paper, we propose OmniCLIP, a framework that adapts CLIP for video recognition by focusing on learning comprehensive features encompassing spatial, temporal, and dynamic spatial-temporal scales, which we refer to as omni-scale features. This is achieved through the design of spatial-temporal blocks that include parallel temporal adapters (PTA), enabling efficient temporal modeling. Additionally, we introduce a self-prompt generator (SPG) module to capture dynamic object spatial features. The synergy between PTA and SPG allows OmniCLIP to discern varying spatial information across frames and assess object scales over time. We have conducted extensive experiments in supervised video recognition, few-shot video recognition, and zero-shot recognition tasks. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, especially with OmniCLIP achieving a top-1 accuracy of 74.30\% on HMDB51 in a 16-shot setting, surpassing the recent MotionPrompt approach even with full training data.

| **[Object Re-identification via Spatial-temporal Fusion Networks and Causal Identity Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05558v1)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object re-identification (ReID) in large camera networks has many challenges. First, the similar appearances of objects degrade ReID performances. This challenge cannot be addressed by existing appearance-based ReID methods. Second, most ReID studies are performed in laboratory settings and do not consider ReID problems in real-world scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel ReID framework that leverages a spatial-temporal fusion network and causal identity matching (CIM). The framework estimates camera network topology using the proposed adaptive Parzen window and combines appearance features with spatial-temporal cue within the Fusion Network. It achieved outstanding performance across several datasets, including VeRi776, Vehicle-3I, and Market-1501, achieving up to 99.70% rank-1 accuracy and 95.5% mAP. Furthermore, the proposed CIM approach, which dynamically assigns gallery sets based on the camera network topology, further improved ReID accuracy and robustness in real-world settings, evidenced by a 94.95% mAP and 95.19% F1 score on the Vehicle-3I dataset. The experimental results support the effectiveness of incorporating spatial-temporal information and CIM for real-world ReID scenarios regardless of the data domain (e.g., vehicle, person).</p></details> |  |
| **[S-SIRUS: an explainability algorithm for spatial regression Random Forest](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05537v1)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random Forest (RF) is a widely used machine learning algorithm known for its flexibility, user-friendliness, and high predictive performance across various domains. However, it is non-interpretable. This can limit its usefulness in applied sciences, where understanding the relationships between predictors and response variable is crucial from a decision-making perspective. In the literature, several methods have been proposed to explain RF, but none of them addresses the challenge of explaining RF in the context of spatially dependent data. Therefore, this work aims to explain regression RF in the case of spatially dependent data by extracting a compact and simple list of rules. In this respect, we propose S-SIRUS, a spatial extension of SIRUS, the latter being a well-established regression rule algorithm able to extract a stable and short list of rules from the classical regression RF algorithm. A simulation study was conducted to evaluate the explainability capability of the proposed S-SIRUS, in comparison to SIRUS, by considering different levels of spatial dependence among the data. The results suggest that S-SIRUS exhibits a higher test predictive accuracy than SIRUS when spatial correlation is present. Moreover, for higher levels of spatial correlation, S-SIRUS produces a shorter list of rules, easing the explanation of the mechanism behind the predictions.</p></details> |  |

This is due to soft materials unique properties, including flexibility, safety, and shock absorption, among others. Despite many advancement in the field, the development of effective design methodologies and production techniques for soft robots remains a challenge. Although numerous robot prototypes have been proposed in recent years, their designs are often complex and difficult to produce. As such, there is a need for more efficient and unified design approaches that can facilitate the production of soft robots with desirable properties. In this paper, we propose a method for designing soft robots using elastic beams and spatial compliant mechanisms. The method is based on an evolutionary approach that enables the creation of designs with both high motion and force transmission ratios. Specifically, we focus on the development of locomotion mechanisms using a central linear actuator. Our approach involves the use of commonly available plastic materials and a 3D printer to manufacture the designs. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by presenting experimental results that show successful production and real world operation. Overall, our findings suggest that the use of elastic beams and an evolutionary approach can facilitate the creation of soft robots with desirable locomotion properties, including fast locomotion up to 3.7 body lengths per second, locomotion with a payload, and underwater locomotion. This method has the potential to enable the development of more efficient and practical soft robots for various applications.</p></details> | 20 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Spatial Deconfounding is Reasonable Statistical Practice: Interpretations, Clarifications, and New Benefits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05106v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spatial linear mixed model (SLMM) consists of fixed and spatial random effects that can be confounded. Restricted spatial regression (RSR) models restrict the spatial random effects to be in the orthogonal column space of the covariates, which "deconfounds" the SLMM. Recent articles have shown that the RSR generally performs worse than the SLMM under a certain interpretation of the RSR. We show that every additive model can be reparameterized as a deconfounded model leading to what we call the linear reparameterization of additive models (LRAM). Under this reparameterization the coefficients of the covariates (referred to as deconfounded regression effects) are different from the (confounded) regression effects in the SLMM. It is shown that under the LRAM interpretation, existing deconfounded spatial models produce estimated deconfounded regression effects, spatial prediction, and spatial prediction variances equivalent to that of SLMM in Bayesian contexts. Furthermore, a general RSR (GRSR) and the SLMM produce identical inferences on confounded regression effects. While our results are in complete agreement with recent criticisms, our new results under the LRAM interpretation provide clarifications that lead to different and sometimes contrary conclusions. Additionally, we discuss the inferential and computational benefits to deconfounding, which we illustrate via a simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Masked adversarial neural network for cell type deconvolution in spatial transcriptomics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05065v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately determining cell type composition in disease-relevant tissues is crucial for identifying disease targets. Most existing spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies cannot achieve single-cell resolution, making it challenging to accurately determine cell types. To address this issue, various deconvolution methods have been developed. Most of these methods use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from the same tissue as a reference to infer cell types in ST data spots. However, they often overlook the differences between scRNA-seq and ST data. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Masked Adversarial Neural Network (MACD). MACD employs adversarial learning to align real ST data with simulated ST data generated from scRNA-seq data. By mapping them into a unified latent space, it can minimize the differences between the two types of data. Additionally, MACD uses masking techniques to effectively learn the features of real ST data and mitigate noise. We evaluated MACD on 32 simulated datasets and 2 real datasets, demonstrating its accuracy in performing cell type deconvolution.

Traditional visual spatial relationship classification (VSRC) methods typically output the spatial relationship between two objects in an image, often neglecting world knowledge and lacking general language capabilities. In this paper, we propose a Large Language-and-Vision Assistant for Visual Spatial Description, named LLaVA-VSD, which is designed for the classification, description, and open-ended description of visual spatial relationships. Specifically, the model first constructs a VSD instruction-following dataset using given figure-caption pairs for the three tasks. It then employs LoRA to fine-tune a Large Language and Vision Assistant for VSD, which has 13 billion parameters and supports high-resolution images. Finally, a large language model (Qwen-2) is used to refine the generated sentences, enhancing their diversity and accuracy. LLaVA-VSD demonstrates excellent multimodal conversational capabilities and can follow open-ended instructions to assist with inquiries about object relationships in images.</p></details> |  |

Spatial domain identification and gene denoising are key objectives in SRT data analysis. We propose a Contrastively Augmented Masked Graph Autoencoder (STMGAC) to learn low-dimensional latent representations for domain identification. In the latent space, persistent signals for representations are obtained through self-distillation to guide self-supervised matching. At the same time, positive and negative anchor pairs are constructed using triplet learning to augment the discriminative ability. We evaluated the performance of STMGAC on five datasets, achieving results superior to those of existing baseline methods.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have demonstrated impressive capability in capturing spectral-spatial contextual dependencies. However, these architectures suffer from limited receptive fields and quadratic computational complexity, respectively. Fortunately, recent Mamba architectures built upon the State Space Model integrate the advantages of long-range sequence modeling and linear computational efficiency, exhibiting substantial potential in low-dimensional scenarios. Motivated by this, we propose a novel 3D-Spectral-Spatial Mamba (3DSS-Mamba) framework for HSI classification, allowing for global spectral-spatial relationship modeling with greater computational efficiency. Technically, a spectral-spatial token generation (SSTG) module is designed to convert the HSI cube into a set of 3D spectral-spatial tokens. To overcome the limitations of traditional Mamba, which is confined to modeling causal sequences and inadaptable to high-dimensional scenarios, a 3D-Spectral-Spatial Selective Scanning (3DSS) mechanism is introduced, which performs pixel-wise selective scanning on 3D hyperspectral tokens along the spectral and spatial dimensions. Five scanning routes are constructed to investigate the impact of dimension prioritization. The 3DSS scanning mechanism combined with conventional mapping operations forms the 3D-spectral-spatial mamba block (3DMB), enabling the extraction of global spectral-spatial semantic representations. Experimental results and analysis demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on HSI classification benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Low-Depth Spatial Tree Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12953v3)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contemporary accelerator designs exhibit a high degree of spatial localization, wherein two-dimensional physical distance determines communication costs between processing elements. This situation presents considerable algorithmic challenges, particularly when managing sparse data, a pivotal component in progressing data science. The spatial computer model quantifies communication locality by weighting processor communication costs by distance, introducing a term named energy. Moreover, it integrates depth, a widely-utilized metric, to promote high parallelism. We propose and analyze a framework for efficient spatial tree algorithms within the spatial computer model. Our primary method constructs a spatial tree layout that optimizes the locality of the neighbors in the compute grid. This approach thereby enables locality-optimized messaging within the tree. Our layout achieves a polynomial factor improvement in energy compared to utilizing a PRAM approach. Using this layout, we develop energy-efficient treefix sum and lowest common ancestor algorithms, which are both fundamental building blocks for other graph algorithms. With high probability, our algorithms exhibit near-linear energy and poly-logarithmic depth. Our contributions augment a growing body of work demonstrating that computations can have both high spatial locality and low depth. Moreover, our work constitutes an advancement in the spatial layout of irregular and sparse computations.</p></details> |  |

Especially when multiple remote users connect, a large shared space is necessary for people to maintain their personal space while collaborating, but the existing simple intersection method leads to the creation of narrow shared spaces as the number of remote spaces increases. To robustly align to the host space even as the number of remote spaces increases, we propose a spatial affordance-aware interactable subspace allocation algorithm. The key concept of our approach is to consider the perceivable and interactable areas separately, where every user views the same mutual space, but each remote user has a different interactable subspace, considering their location and spatial affordance. We conducted an evaluation with 900 space combinations, varying the number of remote spaces as two, four, and six, and results show our method outperformed in securing wide interactable mutual space and instantiating users compared to the other spatial matching methods. Our work enables multiple clients from diverse remote locations to access the AR host's space, allowing them to interact directly with the table, wall, or floor by aligning their physical subspaces within a connected mutual space.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2024 IEEE ISMAR Conference. 10 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

However, prevailing deep learning models struggle with poor generalization due to (i) intra-class variations, where the same class appears differently in different samples, and (ii) inter-class independence, resulting in difficulties capturing intricate relationships between distinct objects, leading to higher false negative cases. This paper presents a novel approach that synergies spatial and spectral representations to enhance domain-generalized medical image segmentation. We introduce the innovative Spectral Correlation Coefficient objective to improve the model's capacity to capture middle-order features and contextual long-range dependencies. This objective complements traditional spatial objectives by incorporating valuable spectral information. Extensive experiments reveal that optimizing this objective with existing architectures like UNet and TransUNet significantly enhances generalization, interpretability, and noise robustness, producing more confident predictions. For instance, in cardiac segmentation, we observe a 0.81 pp and 1.63 pp (pp = percentage point) improvement in DSC over UNet and TransUNet, respectively. Our interpretability study demonstrates that, in most tasks, objectives optimized with UNet outperform even TransUNet by introducing global contextual information alongside local details. These findings underscore the versatility and effectiveness of our proposed method across diverse imaging modalities and medical domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Early...</summary><p>Early Accepted at ICPR-2024 for Oral Presentation</p></details> |

Unlike other time series forecasting problems, crime incidents are sparse, particularly in small regions and within specific time periods. Traditional spatial-temporal deep learning models often struggle with this sparsity, as they typically cannot effectively handle the non-Gaussian nature of crime data, which is characterized by numerous zeros and over-dispersed patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach termed Spatial Temporal Multivariate Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Graph Neural Networks (STMGNN-ZINB). This framework leverages diffusion and convolution networks to analyze spatial, temporal, and multivariate correlations, enabling the parameterization of probabilistic distributions of crime incidents. By incorporating a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial model, STMGNN-ZINB effectively manages the sparse nature of crime data, enhancing prediction accuracy and the precision of confidence intervals. Our evaluation on real-world datasets confirms that STMGNN-ZINB outperforms existing models, providing a more reliable tool for predicting and understanding crime dynamics.</p></details> |  |

These learning-based methods often employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Transformer-based architectures. However, these nonlinear approaches frequently overlook the frequency characteristics of images, which limits their compression efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a novel Transformer-based image compression method that enhances the transformation stage by considering frequency components within the feature map. Our method integrates a novel Hybrid Spatial-Channel Attention Transformer Block (HSCATB), where a spatial-based branch independently handles high and low frequencies at the attention layer, and a Channel-aware Self-Attention (CaSA) module captures information across channels, significantly improving compression performance. Additionally, we introduce a Mixed Local-Global Feed Forward Network (MLGFFN) within the Transformer block to enhance the extraction of diverse and rich information, which is crucial for effective compression. These innovations collectively improve the transformation's ability to project data into a more decorrelated latent space, thereby boosting overall compression efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework surpasses state-of-the-art LIC methods in rate-distortion performance.</p></details> |  |

Commonly, one global numerical sensitivity value is computed per simulation parameter. However, when considering 3D spatial simulations, the analysis of localized sensitivities in different spatial regions is of importance in many applications. For analyzing the spatial variation of parameter sensitivity, one needs to compute a spatial sensitivity scalar field per simulation parameter. Given $n$ simulation parameters, we obtain multi-field data consisting of $n$ scalar fields when considering all simulation parameters. We propose an interactive visual analytics solution to analyze the multi-field sensitivity data. It supports the investigation of how strongly and in what way individual parameters influence the simulation outcome, in which spatial regions this is happening, and what the interplay of the simulation parameters is. Its central component is an overview visualization of all sensitivity fields that avoids 3D occlusions by linearizing the data using an adapted scheme of data-driven space-filling curves. The spatial sensitivity values are visualized in a combination of a Horizon Graph and a line chart. We validate our approach by applying it to synthetic and real-world ensemble data.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages paper, 2 pages appendix, 14 figures paper, 1 figure appendix, accepted at IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG)</p></details> |

However, due to the diverse intra-class spatial layouts and the coexisting inter-class objects, modeling contextual relationships to adapt various image characteristics is a great challenge. Existing contextual modeling methods for scene recognition exhibit two limitations: 1) They typically model only one type of spatial relationship (order or metric) among objects within scenes, with limited exploration of diverse spatial layouts. 2) They often overlook the differences in coexisting objects across different scenes, suppressing scene recognition performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose SpaCoNet, which simultaneously models Spatial relation and Co-occurrence of objects guided by semantic segmentation. Firstly, the Semantic Spatial Relation Module (SSRM) is constructed to model scene spatial features. With the help of semantic segmentation, this module decouples spatial information from the scene image and thoroughly explores all spatial relationships among objects in an end-to-end manner, thereby obtaining semantic-based spatial features. Secondly, both spatial features from the SSRM and deep features from the Image Feature Extraction Module are allocated to each object, so as to distinguish the coexisting object across different scenes. Finally, utilizing the discriminative features above, we design a Global-Local Dependency Module to explore the long-range co-occurrence among objects, and further generate a semantic-guided feature representation for indoor scene recognition. Experimental results on three widely used scene datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under second review at Expert Systems with Applications</p></details> |

This emerging discipline has the potential to serve as a foundation for developing tools to design precision medicines. However, due to the higher costs and expertise required for such experiments, its translation into a regular clinical practice might be challenging. Despite the implementation of modern deep learning to enhance information obtained from histological images using AI, efforts have been constrained by limitations in the diversity of information. In this paper, we developed a model, HistoSPACE that explore the diversity of histological images available with ST data to extract molecular insights from tissue image. Our proposed study built an image encoder derived from universal image autoencoder. This image encoder was connected to convolution blocks to built the final model. It was further fine tuned with the help of ST-Data. This model is notably lightweight in compared to traditional histological models. Our developed model demonstrates significant efficiency compared to contemporary algorithms, revealing a correlation of 0.56 in leave-one-out cross-validation. Finally, its robustness was validated through an independent dataset, showing a well matched preditction with predefined disease pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Frequency Discriminability for Revealing Adversarial Perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10856v3)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial perturbations has been widely perceived in the computer vision community. From a security perspective, it poses a critical risk for modern vision systems, e.g., the popular Deep Learning as a Service (DLaaS) frameworks. For protecting deep models while not modifying them, current algorithms typically detect adversarial patterns through discriminative decomposition for natural and adversarial data. However, these decompositions are either biased towards frequency resolution or spatial resolution, thus failing to capture adversarial patterns comprehensively. Also, when the detector relies on few fixed features, it is practical for an adversary to fool the model while evading the detector (i.e., defense-aware attack). Motivated by such facts, we propose a discriminative detector relying on a spatial-frequency Krawtchouk decomposition. It expands the above works from two aspects: 1) the introduced Krawtchouk basis provides better spatial-frequency discriminability, capturing the differences between natural and adversarial data comprehensively in both spatial and frequency distributions, w.r.t. the common trigonometric or wavelet basis; 2) the extensive features formed by the Krawtchouk decomposition allows for adaptive feature selection and secrecy mechanism, significantly increasing the difficulty of the defense-aware attack, w.r.t. the detector with few fixed features. Theoretical and numerical analyses demonstrate the uniqueness and usefulness of our detector, exhibiting competitive scores on several deep models and image sets against a variety of adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we offer a comprehensive investigation of this limitation, while also developing datasets and methods that support algorithmic solutions to improve spatial reasoning in T2I models. We find that spatial relationships are under-represented in the image descriptions found in current vision-language datasets. To alleviate this data bottleneck, we create SPRIGHT, the first spatially focused, large-scale dataset, by re-captioning 6 million images from 4 widely used vision datasets and through a 3-fold evaluation and analysis pipeline, show that SPRIGHT improves the proportion of spatial relationships in existing datasets. We show the efficacy of SPRIGHT data by showing that using only $\sim$0.25% of SPRIGHT results in a 22% improvement in generating spatially accurate images while also improving FID and CMMD scores. We also find that training on images containing a larger number of objects leads to substantial improvements in spatial consistency, including state-of-the-art results on T2I-CompBench with a spatial score of 0.2133, by fine-tuning on <500 images. Through a set of controlled experiments and ablations, we document additional findings that could support future work that seeks to understand factors that affect spatial consistency in text-to-image models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024.

| **[Spatial autoregressive model with measurement error in covariates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04593v3)** | 2024-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Spatial AutoRegressive model (SAR) is commonly used in studies involving spatial and network data to estimate the spatial or network peer influence and the effects of covariates on the response, taking into account the dependence among units. While the model can be efficiently estimated with a Quasi maximum likelihood approach (QMLE), the detrimental effect of covariate measurement error on the QMLE and how to remedy it is currently unknown. If covariates are measured with error, then the QMLE may not have the $\sqrt{n}$ convergence and may even be inconsistent even when a node is influenced by only a limited number of other nodes or spatial units. We develop a measurement error-corrected ML estimator (ME-QMLE) for the parameters of the SAR model when covariates are measured with error. The ME-QMLE possesses statistical consistency and asymptotic normality properties and we derive its limiting covariance. We consider two types of applications. The first is when the true covariate is imprecisely measured with replicated measurements or cannot be measured directly, and a proxy is observed instead. The second one involves including latent homophily factors estimated with error from the network for estimating peer influence. Our numerical results verify the bias correction property of the estimator and the accuracy of the standard error estimates in finite samples. We illustrate the method on two real datasets; i) peer influence in GPA for middle school students in New Jersey and ii) county-level death rates from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></details> |  |

The spatial domain of EEG is rich in affective information. However, few of the existing studies have simultaneously analyzed EEG signals from multiple perspectives of geometric and anatomical structures in spatial domain. In this paper, we propose a multi-view Graph Transformer (MVGT) based on spatial relations, which integrates information from the temporal, frequency and spatial domains, including geometric and anatomical structures, so as to enhance the expressive power of the model comprehensively. We incorporate the spatial information of EEG channels into the model as encoding, thereby improving its ability to perceive the spatial structure of the channels. Meanwhile, experimental results based on publicly available datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recent years. In addition, the results also show that the MVGT could extract information from multiple domains and capture inter-channel relationships in EEG emotion recognition tasks effectively.</p></details> |  |

However, current CDMs require a paired segmentation map and echocardiogram dataset. We present a new method called Free-Echo for generating realistic echocardiograms from a single end-diastolic segmentation map without additional training data. Our method is based on the 3D-Unet with Temporal Attention Layers model and is conditioned on the segmentation map using a training-free conditioning method based on SDEdit. We evaluate our model on two public echocardiogram datasets, CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic. We show that our model can generate plausible echocardiograms that are spatially aligned with the input segmentation map, achieving performance comparable to training-based CDMs. Our work opens up new possibilities for generating echocardiograms from a single segmentation map, which can be used for data augmentation, domain adaptation, and other applications in medical imaging.

One way to understand the behavior of the swarm is through collective behavior reconstruction using prior demonstrations. Existing approaches often require access to the swarm controller which may not be available. We reconstruct collective behaviors in distinct swarm scenarios involving shared environments without using swarm controller information. We achieve this by transforming prior demonstrations into features that describe multi-agent interactions before behavior reconstruction with multi-agent generative adversarial imitation learning (MA-GAIL). We show that our approach outperforms existing algorithms in spatial organization, and can be used to observe and reconstruct a swarm's behavior for further analysis and testing, which might be impractical or undesirable on the original robot swarm.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures.

Understanding these patterns is crucial in spatial analysis, but interpreting the statistic can be difficult. To simplify this process, we introduce three novel visualizations that enhance the interpretation of Local Moran's I results. These visualizations can be interactively linked to one another, and to established visualizations, to offer a more holistic exploration of the results. We provide a JavaScript library with implementations of these new visual elements, along with a web dashboard that demonstrates their integrated use.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-temporal Graph Convolutional Networks with Diversified Transformation for Dynamic Graph Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02704v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic graphs (DG) are often used to describe evolving interactions between nodes in real-world applications. Temporal patterns are a natural feature of DGs and are also key to representation learning. However, existing dynamic GCN models are mostly composed of static GCNs and sequence modules, which results in the separation of spatiotemporal information and cannot effectively capture complex temporal patterns in DGs. To address this problem, this study proposes a spatial-temporal graph convolutional networks with diversified transformation (STGCNDT), which includes three aspects: a) constructing a unified graph tensor convolutional network (GTCN) using tensor M-products without the need to represent spatiotemporal information separately; b) introducing three transformation schemes in GTCN to model complex temporal patterns to aggregate temporal information; and c) constructing an ensemble of diversified transformation schemes to obtain higher representation capabilities. Empirical studies on four DGs that appear in communication networks show that the proposed STGCNDT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in solving link weight estimation tasks due to the diversified transformations.</p></details> | 8 papges, 1 figure |
| **[Group Multi-View Transformer for 3D Shape Analysis with Spatial Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16477v3)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the results of view-based 3D shape recognition methods have saturated, and models with excellent performance cannot be deployed on memory-limited devices due to their huge size of parameters. To address this problem, we introduce a compression method based on knowledge distillation for this field, which largely reduces the number of parameters while preserving model performance as much as possible. Specifically, to enhance the capabilities of smaller models, we design a high-performing large model called Group Multi-view Vision Transformer (GMViT). In GMViT, the view-level ViT first establishes relationships between view-level features. Additionally, to capture deeper features, we employ the grouping module to enhance view-level features into group-level features. Finally, the group-level ViT aggregates group-level features into complete, well-formed 3D shape descriptors. Notably, in both ViTs, we introduce spatial encoding of camera coordinates as innovative position embeddings. Furthermore, we propose two compressed versions based on GMViT, namely GMViT-simple and GMViT-mini. To enhance the training effectiveness of the small models, we introduce a knowledge distillation method throughout the GMViT process, where the key outputs of each GMViT component serve as distillation targets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. The large model GMViT achieves excellent 3D classification and retrieval results on the benchmark datasets ModelNet, ShapeNetCore55, and MCB. The smaller models, GMViT-simple and GMViT-mini, reduce the parameter size by 8 and 17.6 times, respectively, and improve shape recognition speed by 1.5 times on average, while preserving at least 90% of the classification and retrieval performance.

However, it has been found that such vision-language models lack the ability to correctly reason over spatial relationships. To tackle this shortcoming, we develop the REVISION framework which improves spatial fidelity in vision-language models. REVISION is a 3D rendering based pipeline that generates spatially accurate synthetic images, given a textual prompt. REVISION is an extendable framework, which currently supports 100+ 3D assets, 11 spatial relationships, all with diverse camera perspectives and backgrounds. Leveraging images from REVISION as additional guidance in a training-free manner consistently improves the spatial consistency of T2I models across all spatial relationships, achieving competitive performance on the VISOR and T2I-CompBench benchmarks. We also design RevQA, a question-answering benchmark to evaluate the spatial reasoning abilities of MLLMs, and find that state-of-the-art models are not robust to complex spatial reasoning under adversarial settings. Our results and findings indicate that utilizing rendering-based frameworks is an effective approach for developing spatially-aware generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024.

| **[Probabilistic Design of Multi-Dimensional Spatially-Coupled Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15166v4)** | 2024-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Because of their excellent asymptotic and finite-length performance, spatially-coupled (SC) codes are a class of low-density parity-check codes that is gaining increasing attention. Multi-dimensional (MD) SC codes are constructed by connecting copies of an SC code via relocations in order to mitigate various sources of non-uniformity and improve performance in many data storage and data transmission systems. As the number of degrees of freedom in the MD-SC code design increases, appropriately exploiting them becomes more difficult because of the complexity growth of the design process. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic framework for the MD-SC code design, which is based on the gradient-descent (GD) algorithm, to design better MD codes and address this challenge. In particular, we express the expected number of short cycles, which we seek to minimize, in the graph representation of the code in terms of entries of a probability-distribution matrix that characterizes the MD-SC code design. We then find a locally-optimal probability distribution, which serves as the starting point of a finite-length algorithmic optimizer that produces the final MD-SC code. We offer the theoretical analysis as well as the algorithms, and we present experimental results demonstrating that our MD codes, conveniently called GD-MD codes, have notably lower short cycle numbers compared with the available state-of-the-art. Moreover, our algorithms converge on solutions in few iterations, which confirms the complexity reduction as a result of limiting the search space via the locally-optimal GD-MD distributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages (double column), 5 figures, the short version has been accepted at the IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)</p></details> |
| **[Where Do We Go from Here? Multi-scale Allocentric Relational Inference from Natural Spatial Descriptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16364v2)** | 2024-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When communicating routes in natural language, the concept of acquired spatial knowledge is crucial for geographic information retrieval (GIR) and in spatial cognitive research. However, NLP navigation studies often overlook the impact of such acquired knowledge on textual descriptions. Current navigation studies concentrate on egocentric local descriptions (e.g., `it will be on your right') that require reasoning over the agent's local perception. These instructions are typically given as a sequence of steps, with each action-step explicitly mentioning and being followed by a landmark that the agent can use to verify they are on the right path (e.g., `turn right and then you will see...'). In contrast, descriptions based on knowledge acquired through a map provide a complete view of the environment and capture its overall structure. These instructions (e.g., `it is south of Central Park and a block north of a police station') are typically non-sequential, contain allocentric relations, with multiple spatial relations and implicit actions, without any explicit verification. This paper introduces the Rendezvous (RVS) task and dataset, which includes 10,404 examples of English geospatial instructions for reaching a target location using map-knowledge. Our analysis reveals that RVS exhibits a richer use of spatial allocentric relations, and requires resolving more spatial relations simultaneously compared to previous text-based navigation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

| **[SSUMamba: Spatial-Spectral Selective State Space Model for Hyperspectral Image Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01726v7)** | 2024-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising is a crucial preprocessing step for hyperspectral images (HSIs) due to noise arising from intra-imaging mechanisms and environmental factors. Long-range spatial-spectral correlation modeling is beneficial for HSI denoising but often comes with high computational complexity. Based on the state space model (SSM), Mamba is known for its remarkable long-range dependency modeling capabilities and computational efficiency. Building on this, we introduce a memory-efficient spatial-spectral UMamba (SSUMamba) for HSI denoising, with the spatial-spectral continuous scan (SSCS) Mamba being the core component. SSCS Mamba alternates the row, column, and band in six different orders to generate the sequence and uses the bidirectional SSM to exploit long-range spatial-spectral dependencies. In each order, the images are rearranged between adjacent scans to ensure spatial-spectral continuity. Additionally, 3D convolutions are embedded into the SSCS Mamba to enhance local spatial-spectral modeling. Experiments demonstrate that SSUMamba achieves superior denoising results with lower memory consumption per batch compared to transformer-based methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/lronkitty/SSUMamba.</p></details> |  |
| **[Principal component analysis balancing prediction and approximation accuracy for spatial data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01662v1)** | 2024-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dimension reduction is often the first step in statistical modeling or prediction of multivariate spatial data. However, most existing dimension reduction techniques do not account for the spatial correlation between observations and do not take the downstream modeling task into consideration when finding the lower-dimensional representation. We formalize the closeness of approximation to the original data and the utility of lower-dimensional scores for downstream modeling as two complementary, sometimes conflicting, metrics for dimension reduction. We illustrate how existing methodologies fall into this framework and propose a flexible dimension reduction algorithm that achieves the optimal trade-off. We derive a computationally simple form for our algorithm and illustrate its performance through simulation studies, as well as two applications in air pollution modeling and spatial transcriptomics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Design-Based Inference for Spatial Experiments under Unknown Interference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13599v5)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider design-based causal inference for spatial experiments in which treatments may have effects that bleed out and feed back in complex ways. Such spatial spillover effects violate the standard ``no interference'' assumption for standard causal inference methods. The complexity of spatial spillover effects also raises the risk of misspecification and bias in model-based analyses. We offer an approach for robust inference in such settings without having to specify a parametric outcome model. We define a spatial ``average marginalized effect'' (AME) that characterizes how, in expectation, units of observation that are a specified distance from an intervention location are affected by treatment at that location, averaging over effects emanating from other intervention nodes. We show that randomization is sufficient for non-parametric identification of the AME even if the nature of interference is unknown. Under mild restrictions on the extent of interference, we establish asymptotic distributions of estimators and provide methods for both sample-theoretic and randomization-based inference. We show conditions under which the AME recovers a structural effect. We illustrate our approach with a simulation study. Then we re-analyze a randomized field experiment and a quasi-experiment on forest conservation, showing how our approach offers robust inference on policy-relevant spillover effects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Spectral Morphological Mamba for Hyperspectral Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01372v1)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Transformers have garnered significant attention for Hyperspectral Image Classification (HSIC) due to their self-attention mechanism, which provides strong classification performance. However, these models face major challenges in computational efficiency, as their complexity increases quadratically with the sequence length. The Mamba architecture, leveraging a State Space Model, offers a more efficient alternative to Transformers. This paper introduces the Spatial-Spectral Morphological Mamba (MorpMamba) model. In the MorpMamba model, a token generation module first converts the Hyperspectral Image (HSI) patch into spatial-spectral tokens. These tokens are then processed by a morphology block, which computes structural and shape information using depthwise separable convolutional operations. The extracted information is enhanced in a feature enhancement module that adjusts the spatial and spectral tokens based on the center region of the HSI sample, allowing for effective information fusion within each block. Subsequently, the tokens are refined in a multi-head self-attention block to further improve the feature space. Finally, the combined information is fed into the state space block for classification and the creation of the ground truth map. Experiments on widely used Hyperspectral (HS) datasets demonstrate that the MorpMamba model outperforms (parametric efficiency) both CNN and Transformer models.</p></details> |  |

Despite the advancements in Deep Learning (DL) and Transformer architectures for HSI Classification (HSIC), challenges such as computational efficiency and the need for extensive labeled data persist. This paper introduces WaveMamba, a novel approach that integrates wavelet transformation with the Spatial-Spectral Mamba architecture to enhance HSIC. WaveMamba captures both local texture patterns and global contextual relationships in an end-to-end trainable model. The Wavelet-based enhanced features are then processed through the state-space architecture to model spatial-spectral relationships and temporal dependencies. The experimental results indicate that WaveMamba surpasses existing models, achieving an accuracy improvement of 4.5\% on the University of Houston dataset and a 2.0\% increase on the Pavia University dataset. These findings validate its effectiveness in addressing the complex data interactions inherent in HSIs.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional Mamba models overlook rich spectral information in HSIs and struggle with high dimensionality and sequential data. To address these issues, we propose the SSM with multi-head self-attention and token enhancement (MHSSMamba). This model integrates spectral and spatial information by enhancing spectral tokens and using multi-head attention to capture complex relationships between spectral bands and spatial locations. It also manages long-range dependencies and the sequential nature of HSI data, preserving contextual information across spectral bands. MHSSMamba achieved remarkable classification accuracies of 97.62\% on Pavia University, 96.92\% on the University of Houston, 96.85\% on Salinas, and 99.49\% on Wuhan-longKou datasets.</p></details> |  |

Thus, large amounts of video samples are continuously required for traditional data-driven training. However, samples are not always sufficient in real-world scenarios, promoting few-shot action recognition (FSAR) research. We observe that most recent FSAR works build spatio-temporal relation of video samples via temporal alignment after spatial feature extraction, cutting apart spatial and temporal features within samples. They also capture motion information via narrow perspectives between adjacent frames without considering density, leading to insufficient motion information capturing. Therefore, we propose a novel plug-and-play architecture for FSAR called Spatio-tempOral frAme tuPle enhancer (SOAP) in this paper. The model we designed with such architecture refers to SOAP-Net. Temporal connections between different feature channels and spatio-temporal relation of features are considered instead of simple feature extraction. Comprehensive motion information is also captured, using frame tuples with multiple frames containing more motion information than adjacent frames. Combining frame tuples of diverse frame counts further provides a broader perspective. SOAP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance across well-known benchmarks such as SthSthV2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51. Extensive empirical evaluations underscore the competitiveness, pluggability, generalization, and robustness of SOAP.

Although various neural networks with intricate architectures have been developed to address this problem, they still face two key challenges: i) Recent advancements in network designs for modeling spatio-temporal correlations are starting to see diminishing returns in performance enhancements. ii) Additionally, most models do not account for the spatio-temporal heterogeneity inherent in traffic data, i.e., traffic distribution varies significantly across different regions and traffic flow patterns fluctuate across various time slots. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer (STGormer), which effectively integrates attribute and structure information inherent in traffic data for learning spatio-temporal correlations, and a mixture-of-experts module for capturing heterogeneity along spaital and temporal axes. Specifically, we design two straightforward yet effective spatial encoding methods based on the graph structure and integrate time position encoding into the vanilla transformer to capture spatio-temporal traffic patterns. Additionally, a mixture-of-experts enhanced feedforward neural network (FNN) module adaptively assigns suitable expert layers to distinct patterns via a spatio-temporal gating network, further improving overall prediction accuracy. Experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that STGormer achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

The color, shape, and location of moire patterns may differ across video frames, posing a challenge in learning information from adjacent frames and preserving temporal consistency. Previous video demoireing methods heavily rely on well-designed alignment modules, resulting in substantial computational burdens. Recently, Mamba, an improved version of the State Space Model (SSM), has demonstrated significant potential for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, enabling efficient temporal modeling in video demoireing without requiring a specific alignment module. In this paper, we propose a novel alignment-free Raw video demoireing network with frequency-assisted spatio-temporal Mamba (DemMamba). The Spatial Mamba Block (SMB) and Temporal Mamba Block (TMB) are sequentially arranged to facilitate effective intra- and inter-relationship modeling in Raw videos with moire patterns. Within SMB, an Adaptive Frequency Block (AFB) is introduced to aid demoireing in the frequency domain. For TMB, a Channel Attention Block (CAB) is embedded to further enhance temporal information interactions by exploiting the inter-channel relationships among features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DemMamba surpasses state-of-the-art approaches by 1.3 dB and delivers a superior visual experience.</p></details> |  |

Hence, knowledge obtained from Wi-Fi network measurements can be helpful for a more efficient network management. In this paper, we propose a methodology to predict future values of some specific network metrics (e.g. traffic load, transmission failures, etc.). These predictions may be useful for improving the network performance. After data collection and preprocessing, the correlation between each target access point (AP) and its neighbouring APs is estimated. According to these correlations, either an only-temporal or a spatio-temporal based prediction is done. To evaluate the proposed methodology, real measurements are collected from 100 APs deployed in different university buildings for 3 months. Deep Learning (DL) methods (i.e. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Simple Recurrent Neural Network (SRNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Transformer) are evaluated and compared for both temporal and spatio-temporal based predictions. Moreover, a hybrid prediction methodology is proposed using a spatial processing based on CNN and a temporal prediction based on RNN. The proposed hybrid methodology provides an improvement in the prediction accuracy at expenses of a slight increase in the Training Computational Time (TCT) and negligible in Prediction Computational Time (PCT).</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Temporal Reversed Training for Spiking Neural Networks with Generalized Spatio-Temporal Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09108v1)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention as an ultra-low energy computing paradigm. Recent studies have focused on improving the feature extraction capability of SNNs, but they suffer from inefficient inference and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective temporal reversed training (TRT) method to optimize the spatio-temporal performance of SNNs and circumvent these problems. We perturb the input temporal data by temporal reversal, prompting the SNN to produce original-reversed consistent output logits and to learn perturbation-invariant representations. For static data without temporal dimension, we generalize this strategy by exploiting the inherent temporal property of spiking neurons for spike feature temporal reversal. In addition, we utilize the lightweight ``star operation" (element-wise multiplication) to hybridize the original and temporally reversed spike firing rates and expand the implicit dimensions, which serves as spatio-temporal regularization to further enhance the generalization of the SNN. Our method involves only an additional temporal reversal operation and element-wise multiplication during training, thus incurring negligible training overhead and not affecting the inference efficiency at all. Extensive experiments on static/neuromorphic object/action recognition, and 3D point cloud classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method. In particular, with only two timesteps, our method achieves 74.77\% and 90.57\% accuracy on ImageNet and ModelNet40, respectively.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |
| **[OpenCity: Open Spatio-Temporal Foundation Models for Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10269v1)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate traffic forecasting is crucial for effective urban planning and transportation management, enabling efficient resource allocation and enhanced travel experiences. However, existing models often face limitations in generalization, struggling with zero-shot prediction on unseen regions and cities, as well as diminished long-term accuracy. This is primarily due to the inherent challenges in handling the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of traffic data, coupled with the significant distribution shift across time and space. In this work, we aim to unlock new possibilities for building versatile, resilient and adaptive spatio-temporal foundation models for traffic prediction. To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel foundation model, named OpenCity, that can effectively capture and normalize the underlying spatio-temporal patterns from diverse data characteristics, facilitating zero-shot generalization across diverse urban environments. OpenCity integrates the Transformer architecture with graph neural networks to model the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in traffic data. By pre-training OpenCity on large-scale, heterogeneous traffic datasets, we enable the model to learn rich, generalizable representations that can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of traffic forecasting scenarios.

Unlike conventional test cases that offer a static snapshot of system profile, the designed TX-123BT system incorporates weather-dependent profiles for renewable generation and transmission thermal limits, mimicking the actual Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) system characteristics. Three weather-dependent models are used for the creation of wind and solar power production, and dynamic line rating (DLR) separately. Security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) is conducted on TX-123BT daily profiles and numerical results are compared with the actual ERCOT system for validation. The long-term spatio-temporal profiles can greatly capture the renewable production versatility due to the environmental conditions. An example of hydrogen facilities integration studies is presented to illustrate the advantage of utilizing detailed spatio-temporal profiles of TX-123BT.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 14 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

The safety risk and urgency of autonomous vehicles in the absence of collision are evaluated. To ensure safety and improve road efficiency, a method of pre-compiling the spatio-temporal trajectory of vehicles is established to eliminate conflicts between vehicles in advance. The calculation method of the safe distance under spatio-temporal conditions is studied, considering vehicle speed differences, vehicle positioning errors, and clock errors. By combining collision acceleration and urgent acceleration, an evaluation model for vehicle conflict risk is constructed. Mainline vehicles that may have conflicts with on-ramp vehicles are identified, and the target gap for on-ramp vehicles is determined. Finally, a cooperative control method is established based on the selected target gap, preparing the vehicle travel path in advance. Taking highway ramp merge as an example, the mainline priority spatio-temporal cooperative control method is proposed and verified through simulation. Using SUMO and Python co-simulation, mainline traffic volumes of 800 veh*h-1*lane-1</p></details> |  |
| **[System States Forecasting of Microservices with Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07894v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations) era, accurately forecasting system states is crucial. In microservices systems, this task encounters the challenge of dynamic and complex spatio-temporal relationships among microservice instances, primarily due to dynamic deployments, diverse call paths, and cascading effects among instances. Current time-series forecasting methods, which focus mainly on intrinsic patterns, are insufficient in environments where spatial relationships are critical. Similarly, spatio-temporal graph approaches often neglect the nature of temporal trend, concentrating mostly on message passing between nodes. Moreover, current research in microservices domain frequently underestimates the importance of network metrics and topological structures in capturing the evolving dynamics of systems. This paper introduces STMformer, a model tailored for forecasting system states in microservices environments, capable of handling multi-node and multivariate time series. Our method leverages dynamic network connection data and topological information to assist in modeling the intricate spatio-temporal relationships within the system. Additionally, we integrate the PatchCrossAttention module to compute the impact of cascading effects globally. We have developed a dataset based on a microservices system and conducted comprehensive experiments with STMformer against leading methods. In both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks, our model consistently achieved a 8.6% reduction in MAE(Mean Absolute Error) and a 2.2% reduction in MSE (Mean Squared Error).

Nonetheless, these methods mainly adopt imagepair appearance matching and face challenges of the intrinsic high quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism, resulting in constrained exploitation of temporal information. Inspired by the recently emerged State Space Model Mamba, renowned for its impressive long sequence modeling capabilities and linear computational complexity, this work innovatively proposes a pure Mamba-based framework (MambaVT) to fully exploit spatio-temporal contextual modeling for robust visible-thermal tracking. Specifically, we devise the long-range cross-frame integration component to globally adapt to target appearance variations, and introduce short-term historical trajectory prompts to predict the subsequent target states based on local temporal location clues. Extensive experiments show the significant potential of vision Mamba for RGB-T tracking, with MambaVT achieving state-of-the-art performance on four mainstream benchmarks while requiring lower computational costs. We aim for this work to serve as a simple yet strong baseline, stimulating future research in this field. The code and pre-trained models will be made available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Spatio-Temporal Processing in Spiking Neural Networks through Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07517v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient implementations of spiking neural networks on neuromorphic hardware promise orders of magnitude less power consumption than their non-spiking counterparts. The standard neuron model for spike-based computation on such neuromorphic systems has long been the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron. As a promising advancement, a computationally light augmentation of the LIF neuron model with an adaptation mechanism experienced a recent upswing in popularity, caused by demonstrations of its superior performance on spatio-temporal processing tasks. The root of the superiority of these so-called adaptive LIF neurons however, is not well understood. In this article, we thoroughly analyze the dynamical, computational, and learning properties of adaptive LIF neurons and networks thereof. We find that the frequently observed stability problems during training of such networks can be overcome by applying an alternative discretization method that results in provably better stability properties than the commonly used Euler-Forward method. With this discretization, we achieved a new state-of-the-art performance on common event-based benchmark datasets. We also show that the superiority of networks of adaptive LIF neurons extends to the prediction and generation of complex time series. Our further analysis of the computational properties of networks of adaptive LIF neurons shows that they are particularly well suited to exploit the spatio-temporal structure of input sequences. Furthermore, these networks are surprisingly robust to shifts of the mean input strength and input spike rate, even when these shifts were not observed during training. As a consequence, high-performance networks can be obtained without any normalization techniques such as batch normalization or batch-normalization through time.</p></details> |  |

The weak dependence condition for arrays of random fields is proved to be inherited through transformation and infinite shift. This paves a way to prove the consistency and asymptotic normality of maximum likelihood estimation for dynamic spatio-temporal models (i.e. so-called ultra high-dimensional time series models) when the sample size and/or dimension go to infinity. Especially the asymptotic properties of estimation for network autoregression are obtained under reasonable regularity conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection and Localization with Spatio-Temporal Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05905v2)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WSVAD) task aims to achieve frame-level anomalous event detection with only coarse video-level annotations available. Existing works typically involve extracting global features from full-resolution video frames and training frame-level classifiers to detect anomalies in the temporal dimension. However, most anomalous events tend to occur in localized spatial regions rather than the entire video frames, which implies existing frame-level feature based works may be misled by the dominant background information and lack the interpretation of the detected anomalies. To address this dilemma, this paper introduces a novel method called STPrompt that learns spatio-temporal prompt embeddings for weakly supervised video anomaly detection and localization (WSVADL) based on pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). Our proposed method employs a two-stream network structure, with one stream focusing on the temporal dimension and the other primarily on the spatial dimension. By leveraging the learned knowledge from pre-trained VLMs and incorporating natural motion priors from raw videos, our model learns prompt embeddings that are aligned with spatio-temporal regions of videos (e.g., patches of individual frames) for identify specific local regions of anomalies, enabling accurate video anomaly detection while mitigating the influence of background information. Without relying on detailed spatio-temporal annotations or auxiliary object detection/tracking, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks for the WSVADL task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM2024</p></details> |

We benchmark SET against said models on the charged $N$-body problem, a simple physical system with complex dynamics. While existing spatio-temporal graph neural networks focus on sequential modeling, we empirically demonstrate that leveraging underlying domain symmetries yields considerable improvements for modeling dynamical systems on graphs.</p></details> |  |

Considering the spatio-temporal nature of EEG data, one of our frameworks is based on a CNN-BiLSTM model. The other involves a CNN-Transformer architecture which inherently involves the more versatile attention based learning paradigm. In both cases, a special 1D-CNN feature extraction module is used to generate the initial embeddings with 1D convolutions in the time and the EEG channel domains. Considering the EEG signals are noisy, non stationary and the discriminative features are even less clear (than in semantically structured data such as text or image), we also follow a window-based classification followed by majority voting during inference, to yield labels at a signal level. To illustrate how brain patterns correlate with different image classes, we visualize t-SNE plots of the BiLSTM embeddings alongside brain activation maps for the top 10 classes. These visualizations provide insightful revelations into the distinct neural signatures associated with each visual category, showcasing the BiLSTM's capability to capture and represent the discriminative brain activity linked to visual stimuli. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on the updated EEG-Imagenet dataset with positive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been submitted at ICPR 2024.

However, existing transformer-based methods primarily use self-attention mechanisms for spatio-temporal modeling, leading to a quadratic complexity, unidirectional modeling of spatio-temporal relationships, and insufficient learning of spatial-temporal correlations. Recently, the Mamba architecture, utilizing the state space model (SSM), has exhibited superior long-range modeling capabilities in a variety of vision tasks with linear complexity. In this paper, we propose PoseMamba, a novel purely SSM-based approach with linear complexity for 3D human pose estimation in monocular video. Specifically, we propose a bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block that comprehensively models human joint relations within individual frames as well as temporal correlations across frames. Within this bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block, we introduce a reordering strategy to enhance the local modeling capability of the SSM. This strategy provides a more logical geometric scanning order and integrates it with the global SSM, resulting in a combined global-local spatial scan. We have quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated our approach using two benchmark datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoseMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets while maintaining a smaller model size and reducing computational costs. The code and models will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion Models for EEG Super-Resolution in Epilepsy Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03089v3)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, particularly high-density EEG (HD EEG) devices, is widely used in fields such as neuroscience. HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, meeting the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STADMs) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which then serve as conditional inputs to guide the reverse denoising process of diffusion models. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STADMs demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks of epilepsy patients, indicating their potential to significantly improve the spatial resolution of LR EEG.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpecSTG: A Fast Spectral Diffusion Framework for Probabilistic Spatio-Temporal Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08119v3)** | 2024-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting, a crucial application of spatio-temporal graph (STG) learning, has traditionally relied on deterministic models for accurate point estimations. Yet, these models fall short of quantifying future uncertainties. Recently, many probabilistic methods, especially variants of diffusion models, have been proposed to fill this gap. However, existing diffusion methods typically deal with individual sensors separately when generating future time series, resulting in limited usage of spatial information in the probabilistic learning process. In this work, we propose SpecSTG, a novel spectral diffusion framework, to better leverage spatial dependencies and systematic patterns inherent in traffic data. More specifically, our method generates the Fourier representation of future time series, transforming the learning process into the spectral domain enriched with spatial information. Additionally, our approach incorporates a fast spectral graph convolution designed for Fourier input, alleviating the computational burden associated with existing models. Compared with state-of-the-arts, SpecSTG achieves up to 8% improvements on point estimations and up to 0.78% improvements on quantifying future uncertainties. Furthermore, SpecSTG's training and validation speed is 3.33X of the most efficient existing diffusion method for STG forecasting. The source code for SpecSTG is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SpecSTG.</p></details> |  |

However, acquiring high-resolution MRI typically extends scan time, which can introduce motion artifacts. Super-resolution of MRI therefore emerges as a promising approach to mitigate these challenges. Earlier studies have investigated the use of multiple contrasts for MRI super-resolution (MCSR), whereas majority of them did not fully exploit the rich contrast-invariant structural information. To fully utilize such crucial prior knowledge of multi-contrast MRI, in this work, we propose a novel structure-guided MCSR (SGSR) framework based on a new spatio-frequency co-query attention (CQA) mechanism. Specifically, CQA performs attention on features of multiple contrasts with a shared structural query, which is particularly designed to extract, fuse, and refine the common structures from different contrasts. We further propose a novel frequency-domain CQA module in addition to the spatial domain, to enable more fine-grained structural refinement. Extensive experiments on fastMRI knee data and low-field brain MRI show that SGSR outperforms state-of-the-art MCSR methods with statistical significance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 15th International Workshop on Machine Learning in Medical Imaging (MLMI 2024)</p></details> |

The central aim of multi-agent optimization is for a network of agents to collaboratively solve a system-level optimization problem with local objective functions and node-to-node communication by distributed algorithms. The scalability of such algorithms crucially depends on the complexity of the communication messages, and a number of communication compressors for distributed optimization have recently been proposed in the literature. First of all, we introduce a general spatio-temporal compressor characterized by the stability of the resulting dynamical system along the vector field of the compressor. We show that several important distributed optimization compressors such as the greedy sparsifier, the uniform quantizer, and the scalarizer all fall into the category of this spatio-temporal compressor. Next, we propose two distributed prime-dual flows with the spatio-temporal compressors being applied to local node states and local error states, respectively, and prove (exponential) convergence of the node trajectories to the global optimizer for (strongly) convex cost functions. Finally, a few numerical examples are present to illustrate our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |

Most existing studies show satisfying performance under regular scenarios, but most neglected safety-critical scenarios. In this study, a spatio-temporal dual-encoder network named STDA for safety-critical scenarios was developed. Considering the exceptional capabilities of human drivers in terms of situational awareness and comprehending risks, driver attention was incorporated into STDA to facilitate swift identification of the critical regions, which is expected to improve both performance and interpretability. STDA contains four parts: the driver attention prediction module, which predicts driver attention; the fusion module designed to fuse the features between driver attention and raw images; the temporary encoder module used to enhance the capability to interpret dynamic scenes; and the behavior prediction module to predict the behavior. The experiment data are used to train and validate the model. The results show that STDA improves the G-mean from 0.659 to 0.719 when incorporating driver attention and adopting a temporal encoder module. In addition, extensive experimentation has been conducted to validate that the proposed module exhibits robust generalization capabilities and can be seamlessly integrated into other mainstream models.</p></details> |  |

This study, part of the European LAMASUS (Land Management for Sustainability) project, aims to support the EU's climate neutrality target by developing a governance model through collaboration between policymakers, land users, and researchers. We present a methodological synthesis for treating land use data using a Bayesian approach within spatial and spatio-temporal modeling frameworks. The study tackles the challenges of analyzing land use changes, particularly the presence of zero values and computational issues with large datasets. It introduces joint model structures to address zeros and employs sequential inference and consensus methods for Big Data problems. Spatial downscaling models approximate smaller scales from aggregated data, circumventing high-resolution data complications. We explore Beta regression and Compositional Data Analysis (CoDa) for land use data, review relevant spatial and spatio-temporal models, and present strategies for handling zeros. The paper demonstrates the implementation of key models, downscaling techniques, and solutions to Big Data challenges with examples from simulated data and the LAMASUS project, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding and managing land use changes.</p></details> | 29 pages, 6 figures |

Existing work either assumes all locations are equipped with sensors or focuses on short-term forecast. This paper studies partial sensing traffic forecast of long-term traffic, assuming sensors only at some locations. The study is important in lowering the infrastructure investment cost in traffic management since deploying sensors at all locations could incur prohibitively high cost. However, the problem is challenging due to the unknown distribution at unsensed locations, the intricate spatio-temporal correlation in long-term forecasting, as well as noise in data and irregularities in traffic patterns (e.g., road closure). We propose a Spatio-Temporal Partial Sensing (STPS) forecast model for long-term traffic prediction, with several novel contributions, including a rank-based embedding technique to capture irregularities and overcome noise, a spatial transfer matrix to overcome the spatial distribution shift from permanently sensed locations to unsensed locations, and a multi-step training process that utilizes all available data to successively refine the model parameters for better accuracy. Extensive experiments on several real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that STPS outperforms the state-of-the-art and achieves superior accuracy in partial sensing long-term forecasting.</p></details> |  |

However, their predictive distribution is not generally known. Under this modeling assumption, we define a novel spatio-temporal embedding and a theory-guided machine learning approach that employs a generalized Bayesian algorithm to make ensemble forecasts. We use Lipschitz predictors and determine fixed-time and any-time PAC Bayesian bounds in the batch learning setting. Performing causal forecast is a highlight of our methodology as its potential application to data with spatial and temporal short and long-range dependence. We then test the performance of our learning methodology by using linear predictors and data sets simulated from a spatio-temporal Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</p></details> |  |

But coarse, heterogeneous aggregations complicate learning and integration for downstream AI/ML systems. In this work, we consider models to disaggregate spatio-temporal data from a low-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., census tract) to a high-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., city block). We propose an overarching model named the Structurally-Aware Recurrent Network (SARN), which integrates structurally-aware spatial attention (SASA) layers into the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model. The spatial attention layers capture spatial interactions among regions, while the gated recurrent module captures the temporal dependencies. Each SASA layer calculates both global and structural attention -- global attention facilitates comprehensive interactions between different geographic levels, while structural attention leverages the containment relationship between different geographic levels (e.g., a city block being wholly contained within a census tract) to ensure coherent and consistent results. For scenarios with limited historical training data, we explore transfer learning and show that a model pre-trained on one city variable can be fine-tuned for another city variable using only a few hundred samples. Evaluating these techniques on two mobility datasets, we find that on both datasets, SARN significantly outperforms other neural models (5% and 1%) and typical heuristic methods (40% and 14%), enabling us to generate realistic, high-quality fine-grained data for downstream applications.</p></details> |  |

Different from conventional approaches that statically estimate fetal brain motions from pairs of images, our method dynamically tracks the rigid movement patterns of the fetal head across temporal and spatial dimensions. Specifically, we first develop an equivariant neural network that efficiently learns rigid motion sequences through low-dimensional spatial representations of images. Subsequently, we learn spatio-temporal representations by incorporating time encoding and self-attention neural network layers. This approach allows for the capture of long-term dependencies of fetal brain motion and addresses alignment errors due to contrast changes and severe motion artifacts. Our model also provides a geometric deformation estimation that properly addresses image distortions among all time frames. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to learn spatial-temporal representations via deep neural networks for fetal motion tracking without data augmentation. We validated our model using real fetal echo-planar images with simulated and real motions. Our method carries significant potential value in accurately measuring, tracking, and correcting fetal motion in fetal MRI sequences.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions (MICCAI) Workshop on Perinatal Imaging, Placental and Preterm Image analysis (PIPPI) 2024</p></details> |

Traditional methods rely on self-report questionnaires and clinical assessment, lacking objective biomarkers. Combining fMRI with artificial intelligence can enhance depression diagnosis by integrating neuroimaging indicators. However, the specificity of fMRI acquisition for depression often results in unbalanced and small datasets, challenging the sensitivity and accuracy of classification models. In this study, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network (STANet) for diagnosing depression by integrating CNN and RNN to capture both temporal and spatial features of brain activity. STANet comprises the following steps:(1) Aggregate spatio-temporal information via ICA. (2) Utilize multi-scale deep convolution to capture detailed features. (3) Balance data using the SMOTE to generate new samples for minority classes. (4) Employ the AFGRU classifier, which combines Fourier transformation with GRU, to capture long-term dependencies, with an adaptive weight assignment mechanism to enhance model generalization. The experimental results demonstrate that STANet achieves superior depression diagnostic performance with 82.38% accuracy and a 90.72% AUC. The STFA module enhances classification by capturing deeper features at multiple scales. The AFGRU classifier, with adaptive weights and stacked GRU, attains higher accuracy and AUC. SMOTE outperforms other oversampling methods. Additionally, spatio-temporal aggregated features achieve better performance compared to using only temporal or spatial features. STANet outperforms traditional or deep learning classifiers, and functional connectivity-based classifiers, as demonstrated by ten-fold cross-validation.</p></details> |  |

These programs are being increasingly asked to provide forest parameter estimates for spatial and temporal extents smaller than their current design and accompanying design-based methods can deliver with desired levels of uncertainty. Many NFI designs and estimation methods focus on status and are not well equipped to provide acceptable estimates for trend and change parameters, especially over small spatial domains and/or short time periods. Fine-scale space-time indexed estimates are critical to a variety of environmental, ecological, and economic monitoring efforts. Estimates for forest carbon status, trend, and change are of particular importance to international initiatives to track carbon dynamics. Model-based small area estimation (SAE) methods for NFI and similar ecological monitoring data typically pursue inference on status within small spatial domains, with few demonstrated methods that account for spatio-temporal dependence needed for trend and change estimation. We propose a spatio-temporal Bayesian model framework that delivers statistically valid estimates with full uncertainty quantification for status, trend, and change. The framework accommodates a variety of space and time dependency structures, and we detail model configurations for different settings. Through analysis of simulated datasets, we compare the relative performance of candidate models and a traditional direct estimator. We then apply candidate models to a large-scale NFI dataset to demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework for providing unique quantification of forest carbon dynamics in the contiguous United States. We also provide computationally efficient algorithms, software, and data to reproduce our results and for benchmarking.</p></details> |  |

The issues of irrelevant facial movements and the challenge of detecting subtle motions in micro-expressions remain unresolved, hindering accurate expression spotting. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for facial expression spotting. First, we propose a Sliding Window-based Multi-Resolution Optical flow (SW-MRO) feature, which calculates multi-resolution optical flow of the input image sequence within compact sliding windows. The window length is tailored to perceive complete micro-expressions and distinguish between general macro- and micro-expressions. SW-MRO can effectively reveal subtle motions while avoiding severe head movement problems. Second, we propose SpotFormer, a multi-scale spatio-temporal Transformer that simultaneously encodes spatio-temporal relationships of the SW-MRO features for accurate frame-level probability estimation. In SpotFormer, our proposed Facial Local Graph Pooling (FLGP) and convolutional layers are applied for multi-scale spatio-temporal feature extraction. We show the validity of the architecture of SpotFormer by comparing it with several model variants. Third, we introduce supervised contrastive learning into SpotFormer to enhance the discriminability between different types of expressions. Extensive experiments on SAMM-LV and CAS(ME)^2 show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models, particularly in micro-expression spotting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Orca: Ocean Significant Wave Height Estimation with Spatio-temporally Aware Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20053v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Significant wave height (SWH) is a vital metric in marine science, and accurate SWH estimation is crucial for various applications, e.g., marine energy development, fishery, early warning systems for potential risks, etc. Traditional SWH estimation methods that are based on numerical models and physical theories are hindered by computational inefficiencies. Recently, machine learning has emerged as an appealing alternative to improve accuracy and reduce computational time. However, due to limited observational technology and high costs, the scarcity of real-world data restricts the potential of machine learning models. To overcome these limitations, we propose an ocean SWH estimation framework, namely Orca. Specifically, Orca enhances the limited spatio-temporal reasoning abilities of classic LLMs with a novel spatiotemporal aware encoding module. By segmenting the limited buoy observational data temporally, encoding the buoys' locations spatially, and designing prompt templates, Orca capitalizes on the robust generalization ability of LLMs to estimate significant wave height effectively with limited data. Experimental results on the Gulf of Mexico demonstrate that Orca achieves state-of-the-art performance in SWH estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Deepsets for Off-policy Evaluation under Spatial or Spatio-temporal Interferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17910v1)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is widely applied in sectors such as pharmaceuticals and e-commerce to evaluate the efficacy of novel products or policies from offline datasets. This paper introduces a causal deepset framework that relaxes several key structural assumptions, primarily the mean-field assumption, prevalent in existing OPE methodologies that handle spatio-temporal interference. These traditional assumptions frequently prove inadequate in real-world settings, thereby restricting the capability of current OPE methods to effectively address complex interference effects. In response, we advocate for the implementation of the permutation invariance (PI) assumption. This innovative approach enables the data-driven, adaptive learning of the mean-field function, offering a more flexible estimation method beyond conventional averaging. Furthermore, we present novel algorithms that incorporate the PI assumption into OPE and thoroughly examine their theoretical foundations. Our numerical analyses demonstrate that this novel approach yields significantly more precise estimations than existing baseline algorithms, thereby substantially improving the practical applicability and effectiveness of OPE methodologies. A Python implementation of our proposed method is available at https://github.com/BIG-S2/Causal-Deepsets.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods either utilize multi-modal information in video-text pairs or apply global and local alignment techniques to promote alignment precision. However, these methods often fail to fully explore the spatio-temporal relationships among vision tokens within video and across different video-text pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer module to uniformly learn spatial and temporal contexts for video-language alignment pre-training (dubbed STGT). Specifically, our STGT combines spatio-temporal graph structure information with attention in transformer block, effectively utilizing the spatio-temporal contexts. In this way, we can model the relationships between vision tokens, promoting video-text alignment precision for benefiting downstream tasks. In addition, we propose a self-similarity alignment loss to explore the inherent self-similarity in the video and text. With the initial optimization achieved by contrastive learning, it can further promote the alignment accuracy between video and text. Experimental results on challenging downstream tasks, including video-text retrieval and video question answering, verify the superior performance of our method.</p></details> | under review |

Current state-of-the-art methods either require multiple independent stages of processing that employ motion cues or, in the case of end-to-end trainable networks, lack in segmentation accuracy, in part due to the difficulty of learning segmentation maps from videos with transient object presence. This limits the application of WSVOS for semantic annotation of surgical videos where multiple surgical tools frequently move in and out of the field of view, a problem that is more difficult than typically encountered in WSVOS. This paper introduces Video Spatio-Temporal Disentanglement Networks (VDST-Net), a framework to disentangle spatiotemporal information using semi-decoupled knowledge distillation to predict high-quality class activation maps (CAMs). A teacher network designed to resolve temporal conflicts when specifics about object location and timing in the video are not provided works with a student network that integrates information over time by leveraging temporal dependencies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on a public reference dataset and on a more challenging surgical video dataset where objects are, on average, present in less than 60\% of annotated frames. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and generates superior segmentation masks under video-level weak supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Additionally, the knowledge map displays spatial and temporal distributions via spatial maps and time axes, respectively. Our visualization technology addresses the limitations inherent in single-view approaches and the deficiency of interaction in spatio-temporal perspectives evident in existing visualization methods. Moreover, we have encapsulated this technology within an integrated, open-source platform named GeoViz.

| **[Towards Effective Fusion and Forecasting of Multimodal Spatio-temporal Data for Smart Mobility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16123v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of location based services, multimodal spatio-temporal (ST) data including trajectories, transportation modes, traffic flow and social check-ins are being collected for deep learning based methods. These deep learning based methods learn ST correlations to support the downstream tasks in the fields such as smart mobility, smart city and other intelligent transportation systems. Despite their effectiveness, ST data fusion and forecasting methods face practical challenges in real-world scenarios. First, forecasting performance for ST data-insufficient area is inferior, making it necessary to transfer meta knowledge from heterogeneous area to enhance the sparse representations. Second, it is nontrivial to accurately forecast in multi-transportation-mode scenarios due to the fine-grained ST features of similar transportation modes, making it necessary to distinguish and measure the ST correlations to alleviate the influence caused by entangled ST features. At last, partial data modalities (e.g., transportation mode) are lost due to privacy or technical issues in certain scenarios, making it necessary to effectively fuse the multimodal sparse ST features and enrich the ST representations. To tackle these challenges, our research work aim to develop effective fusion and forecasting methods for multimodal ST data in smart mobility scenario. In this paper, we will introduce our recent works that investigates the challenges in terms of various real-world applications and establish the open challenges in this field for future work.</p></details> | 4 pages |

Although Bayesian methods are common in spatio-temporal modeling, standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques are usually slow for large datasets such as house price data. To tackle this problem, we propose a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal modeling approach. This method involves partitioning the data into multiple subsets and applying an appropriate Gaussian process model to each subset in parallel. The results from each subset are then combined using the Wasserstein barycenter technique to obtain the global parameters for the original problem. The proposed methodology allows for multiple observations per spatial and time unit, thereby offering added benefits for practitioners. As a real-life application, we analyze house price data of more than 0.6 million transactions from 983 middle layer super output areas in London over a period of eight years. The methodology provides insightful findings about the effects of various amenities, trend patterns, and the relationship between prices and carbon emissions. Furthermore, as demonstrated through a cross-validation study, it shows good predictive accuracy while balancing computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary material is available from the authors upon request</p></details> |

Large space-time datasets call for new numerical methods to efficiently process them. The Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) approach has proven to be effective for the estimation and the prediction in a spatial context. We present here the advection-diffusion SPDE with first order derivative in time which defines a large class of nonseparable spatio-temporal models. A Gaussian Markov random field approximation of the solution to the SPDE is built by discretizing the temporal derivative with a finite difference method (implicit Euler) and by solving the spatial SPDE with a finite element method (continuous Galerkin) at each time step. The ''Streamline Diffusion'' stabilization technique is introduced when the advection term dominates the diffusion. Computationally efficient methods are proposed to estimate the parameters of the SPDE and to predict the spatio-temporal field by kriging, as well as to perform conditional simulations. The approach is applied to a solar radiation dataset. Its advantages and limitations are discussed.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Approach with Self-Corrective Causal Inference for Flight Delay Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15185v1)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate flight delay prediction is crucial for the secure and effective operation of the air traffic system. Recent advances in modeling inter-airport relationships present a promising approach for investigating flight delay prediction from the multi-airport scenario. However, the previous prediction works only accounted for the simplistic relationships such as traffic flow or geographical distance, overlooking the intricate interactions among airports and thus proving inadequate. In this paper, we leverage causal inference to precisely model inter-airport relationships and propose a self-corrective spatio-temporal graph neural network (named CausalNet) for flight delay prediction. Specifically, Granger causality inference coupled with a self-correction module is designed to construct causality graphs among airports and dynamically modify them based on the current airport's delays. Additionally, the features of the causality graphs are adaptively extracted and utilized to address the heterogeneity of airports. Extensive experiments are conducted on the real data of top-74 busiest airports in China. The results show that CausalNet is superior to baselines. Ablation studies emphasize the power of the proposed self-correction causality graph and the graph feature extraction module. All of these prove the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Source and Test-Time Domain Adaptation on Multivariate Signals using Spatio-Temporal Monge Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14303v1)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning applications on signals such as computer vision or biomedical data often face significant challenges due to the variability that exists across hardware devices or session recordings. This variability poses a Domain Adaptation (DA) problem, as training and testing data distributions often differ. In this work, we propose Spatio-Temporal Monge Alignment (STMA) to mitigate these variabilities. This Optimal Transport (OT) based method adapts the cross-power spectrum density (cross-PSD) of multivariate signals by mapping them to the Wasserstein barycenter of source domains (multi-source DA). Predictions for new domains can be done with a filtering without the need for retraining a model with source data (test-time DA). We also study and discuss two special cases of the method, Temporal Monge Alignment (TMA) and Spatial Monge Alignment (SMA). Non-asymptotic concentration bounds are derived for the mappings estimation, which reveals a bias-plus-variance error structure with a variance decay rate of $\mathcal{O}(n_\ell^{-1/2})$ with $n_\ell$ the signal length. This theoretical guarantee demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed computational schema. Numerical experiments on multivariate biosignals and image data show that STMA leads to significant and consistent performance gains between datasets acquired with very different settings. Notably, STMA is a pre-processing step complementary to state-of-the-art deep learning methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Higher-order Spatio-temporal Physics-incorporated Graph Neural Network for Multivariate Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10995v2)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploring the missing values is an essential but challenging issue due to the complex latent spatio-temporal correlation and dynamic nature of time series. Owing to the outstanding performance in dealing with structure learning potentials, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are often used to capture such complex spatio-temporal features in multivariate time series. However, these data-driven models often fail to capture the essential spatio-temporal relationships when significant signal corruption occurs. Additionally, calculating the high-order neighbor nodes in these models is of high computational complexity. To address these problems, we propose a novel higher-order spatio-temporal physics-incorporated GNN (HSPGNN). Firstly, the dynamic Laplacian matrix can be obtained by the spatial attention mechanism. Then, the generic inhomogeneous partial differential equation (PDE) of physical dynamic systems is used to construct the dynamic higher-order spatio-temporal GNN to obtain the missing time series values. Moreover, we estimate the missing impact by Normalizing Flows (NF) to evaluate the importance of each node in the graph for better explainability. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HSPGNN and the superior performance when combining various order neighbor nodes. Also, graph-like optical flow, dynamic graphs, and missing impact can be obtained naturally by HSPGNN, which provides better dynamic analysis and explanation than traditional data-driven models.

Traditional methods rely on hand-crafted features and machine learning techniques, which often struggle to model the complex dynamics of human motion. Recent deep learning-based methods have achieved success by learning spatio-temporal representations of motion, but these models often overlook the reliability of motion data. Additionally, the temporal and spatial dependencies of skeleton nodes are distinct. The temporal relationship captures motion information over time, while the spatial relationship describes body structure and the relationships between different nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal branching network using incremental information for HMP, which decouples the learning of temporal-domain and spatial-domain features, extracts more motion information, and achieves complementary cross-domain knowledge learning through knowledge distillation. Our approach effectively reduces noise interference and provides more expressive information for characterizing motion by separately extracting temporal and spatial features. We evaluate our approach on standard HMP benchmarks and outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>The i...</summary><p>The incremental information of our paper includes the displacement information from the last frame of the historical sequence, derived from the motion information of the first frame in the future sequence and the motion information of the last frame of the historical sequence.

Changes in the size, shape and movement of the chambers can be important markers for cardiac disease and modeling this in relation to clinical demography or disease is therefore of interest. Existing methods for spatio-temporal modeling of the human heart require shape correspondence over time or suffer from large memory requirements, making it difficult to use for complex anatomies. We introduce a novel conditional generative model, where the shape and movement is modeled implicitly in the form of a spatio-temporal neural distance field and conditioned on clinical demography. The model is based on an auto-decoder architecture and aims to disentangle the individual variations from that related to the clinical demography. It is tested on the left atrium (including the left atrial appendage), where it outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for anatomical sequence completion and generates synthetic sequences that realistically mimics the shape and motion of the real left atrium. In practice, this means we can infer functional measurements from a static image, generate synthetic populations with specified demography or disease and investigate how non-imaging clinical data effect the shape and motion of cardiac anatomies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for MICCAI2024</p></details> |

However, estimating incidence or mortality rates associated with rare cancers presents important difficulties and poses new statistical methodological challenges. In this paper, we expand the collection of multivariate spatio-temporal models by introducing adaptable shared spatio-temporal components to enable a comprehensive analysis of both incidence and cancer mortality in rare cancer cases. These models allow the modulation of spatio-temporal effects between incidence and mortality, allowing for changes in their relationship over time. The new models have been implemented in INLA using r-generic constructions. We conduct a simulation study to evaluate the performance of the new spatio-temporal models. Our results show that multivariate spatio-temporal models incorporating a flexible shared spatio-temporal term outperform conventional multivariate spatio-temporal models that include specific spatio-temporal effects for each health outcome. We use these models to analyze incidence and mortality data for pancreatic cancer and leukaemia among males across 142 administrative health care districts of Great Britain over a span of nine biennial periods (2002-2019).</p></details> | 40 pages, 12 figures |

To address this limitation, this paper presents the spatio-temporal GraphFormer framework for 3D human pose estimation in video, which integrates body structure graph-based representations with spatio-temporal information. Specifically, we develop a spatio-temporal criss-cross graph (STG) attention mechanism. This approach is designed to learn the long-range dependencies in data across both time and space, integrating graph information directly into the respective attention layers. Furthermore, we introduce the dual-path modulated hop-wise regular GCN (MHR-GCN) module, which utilizes modulation to optimize parameter usage and employs spatio-temporal hop-wise skip connections to acquire higher-order information. Additionally, this module processes temporal and spatial dimensions independently to learn their respective features while avoiding mutual influence. Finally, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D human pose estimation on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets.</p></details> |  |

We propose a Spatio-Temporal Aligned SUNet (STA-SUNet) model using a Swin Transformer as a backbone to capture low light video features and exploit their spatio-temporal correlations. The STA-SUNet model is trained on a novel, fully registered dataset (BVI), which comprises dynamic scenes captured under varying light conditions. It is further analysed comparatively against various other models over three test datasets. The model demonstrates superior adaptivity across all datasets, obtaining the highest PSNR and SSIM values. It is particularly effective in extreme low-light conditions, yielding fairly good visualisation results.</p></details> |  |

In this regard, covariance properties with respect to geometric image transformations in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy are essential for expressing robust image operations, and for formulating invariant visual operations at higher levels. This paper defines and proves a set of joint covariance properties for spatio-temporal receptive fields in terms of spatio-temporal derivative operators applied to spatio-temporally smoothed image data under compositions of spatial scaling transformations, spatial affine transformations, Galilean transformations and temporal scaling transformations. Specifically, the derived relations show how the parameters of the receptive fields need to be transformed, in order to match the output from spatio-temporal receptive fields under composed spatio-temporal image transformations. For this purpose, we also fundamentally extend the notion of scale-normalized derivatives to affine-normalized derivatives, that are computed based on spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels, and analyze the covariance properties of the resulting affine-normalized derivatives for the affine group as well as for important subgroups thereof. We conclude with a geometric analysis, showing how the derived joint covariance properties make it possible to relate or match spatio-temporal receptive field responses, when observing, possibly moving, local surface patches from different views, under locally linearized perspective or projective transformations, as well as when observing different instances of spatio-temporal events, that may occur either faster or slower between different views of similar spatio-temporal events.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 13 figures.

Designing spatio-temporal forecasting models separately in a task-wise and city-wise manner to forecast demand and supply-demand gap in a ride-hailing system poses a burden for the expanding transportation network companies.

If an AV can predict its surrounding vehicles' future trajectories, it can make safe and efficient manoeuvre decisions. In this paper, we present such a Deep Spatio-Temporal Context-Aware decision Network (DST-CAN) model for predictive manoeuvre planning of AVs. A memory neuron network is used to predict future trajectories of its surrounding vehicles. The driving environment's spatio-temporal information (past, present, and predicted future trajectories) are embedded into a context-aware grid. The proposed DST-CAN model employs these context-aware grids as inputs to a convolutional neural network to understand the spatial relationships between the vehicles and determine a safe and efficient manoeuvre decision. The DST-CAN model also uses information of human driving behavior on a highway. Performance evaluation of DST-CAN has been carried out using two publicly available NGSIM US-101 and I-80 datasets. Also, rule-based ground truth decisions have been compared with those generated by DST-CAN. The results clearly show that DST-CAN can make much better decisions with 3-sec of predicted trajectories of neighboring vehicles compared to currently existing methods that do not use this prediction.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

Traditional methods based on generative adversarial networks(GAN) or joint learning frameworks can achieve good prediction accuracy under low observation ratios, but they usually have high computational costs. In view of this, this paper proposes a spatio-temporal encoding and decoding-based method for future human activity skeleton synthesis. Firstly, algorithms such as time control, discrete cosine transform, and low-pass filtering are used to cut or pad the skeleton sequences. Secondly, the encoder and decoder are responsible for extracting intermediate semantic encoding from observed skeleton sequences and inferring future sequences from the intermediate semantic encoding, respectively. Finally, joint displacement error, velocity error, and acceleration error, three higher-order kinematic features, are used as key components of the loss function to optimize model parameters. Experimental results show that the proposed future skeleton synthesis algorithm performs better than some existing algorithms. It generates skeleton sequences with smaller errors and fewer model parameters, effectively providing future information for early activity prediction.</p></details> |  |

We train this model on the Raw Heidelberg Digits keyword spotting benchmark using Backpropagation Through Time with surrogate gradients. Analysing the spatio-temporal structure of synaptic interactions in the network we observe that after training excitation and inhibition are grouped together both in space and time. To further enhance the efficiency and biological realism of our model, we implemented a dynamic pruning strategy that combines DEEP R for connection removal and RigL for connection reintroduction, ensuring that the network maintains optimal connectivity throughout training. Additionally, we incorporated Dale's Principle, enforcing each neuron to be exclusively excitatory or inhibitory -- aligning our model closer to biological neural networks. We observed that, after training, the spatio-temporal patterns of excitation and inhibition appeared in the more biologically plausible model as well. Our research demonstrates the potential of integrating learnable delays, dynamic pruning, and biological constraints to develop efficient SNN models for temporal data processing. Furthermore, our results enhance the understanding of spatio-temporal dynamics in SNNs -- suggesting that the spatio-temporal features which emerge from training are robust to both pruning and rewiring processes -- providing a solid foundation for future work in neuromorphic computing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, submitted to Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience</p></details> |

To address these problems, this study proposes a spatio-temporal model that incorporates skewness while maintaining mean and variance, by applying the flexible subclass of the closed skew-normal distribution. An efficient sampling method is introduced, leveraging the autoregressive representation of the model. Additionally, the model's symmetry concerning spatial order is demonstrated, and Mardia's skewness and kurtosis are derived, showing independence from the mean and variance. Simulation studies compare the estimation performance of the proposed model with that of the Gaussian model. The result confirms its superiority in high skewness and low observation noise scenarios. The identification of Cobb-Douglas production functions across US states is examined as an application to real data, revealing that the proposed model excels in both goodness-of-fit and predictive performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Adversarial Networks for Spatio-Spectral Compression of Hyperspectral Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08514v3)** | 2024-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of deep learning-based models for the compression of hyperspectral images (HSIs) has recently attracted great attention in remote sensing due to the sharp growing of hyperspectral data archives. Most of the existing models achieve either spectral or spatial compression, and do not jointly consider the spatio-spectral redundancies present in HSIs. To address this problem, in this paper we focus our attention on the High Fidelity Compression (HiFiC) model (which is proven to be highly effective for spatial compression problems) and adapt it to perform spatio-spectral compression of HSIs. In detail, we introduce two new models: i) HiFiC using Squeeze and Excitation (SE) blocks (denoted as HiFiC$_{SE}$); and ii) HiFiC with 3D convolutions (denoted as HiFiC$_{3D}$) in the framework of compression of HSIs. We analyze the effectiveness of HiFiC$_{SE}$ and HiFiC$_{3D}$ in compressing the spatio-spectral redundancies with channel attention and inter-dependency analysis. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed models in performing spatio-spectral compression, while reconstructing images at reduced bitrates with higher reconstruction quality. The code of the proposed models is publicly available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/HSI-SSC .</p></details> |  |

We train these networks to predict the dynamics of delay-dynamical and spatio-temporal systems for a single size. Then, we drive the networks by their own predictions. We demonstrate that by scaling the size of the trained network, we can predict the complex dynamics for larger or smaller system sizes. Thus, the network learns from a single example and, by exploiting symmetry properties, infers entire bifurcation diagrams.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enabling Multicast Transmission for Spatio-Temporally Asynchronous User Requests in Wireless Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04239v1)** | 2024-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The surge in wireless devices and data traffic volume necessitates more efficient transmission methods. Multicasting has garnered consistent attention as a means to fulfill the increasing demand for more efficient data transmission methods. Nevertheless, leveraging multicast wireless networks for spatio-temporally asynchronous data requests poses challenges. In this context, this paper introduces a new multicast mechanism called \emph{set-up based merged multicast (SMMC)} to minimize the delivery time of the requested file in wireless networks by considering the uncertainties inherent in wireless channels. The proposed mechanism comprises two phases. The first phase involves gathering asynchronous requests for a file from users experiencing diverse channel conditions. During this phase, packets of the requested file are transmitted individually in unicast mode within a specified set-up time. Following this, the second phase initiates multicast transmission, which sequentially handles the remaining packets of the file in multicast mode. In the proposed mechanism, we optimize the set-up time and transmission rates of both unicast and multicast modes to minimize the expected file delivery time by jointly taking into account the statistical characteristics of wireless channels, users' locations, and file popularity. Additionally, we also delve into a \emph{fine-tuned SMMC} by utilizing posterior information on the multicast group size and further improve the performance. Our performance evaluations reveal that the proposed SMMC outperforms conventional unicast methods, especially with high-demand data.</p></details> |  |

In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from the stochastic processes associated with the particle labels. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over a large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the limiting dynamics of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</p></details> |  |

Many research works, including Potential Outcome Model and Structural Causal Model, have been proposed to realize it. However, their modelings, theoretical foundations and application approaches are usually different. Moreover, there is a lack of graphical approach to infer spatio-temporal counterfactuals, that considers spatial and temporal interactions between multiple units. Thus, in this work, our aim is to investigate a survey to compare and discuss different counterfactual models, theories and approaches, and further build a unified graphical causal frameworks to infer the spatio-temporal counterfactuals.</p></details> |  |

Despite remarkable breakthroughs in pretrained natural language models that enable one model to handle diverse tasks, a universal solution for spatio-temporal prediction remains challenging Existing prediction approaches are typically tailored for specific spatio-temporal scenarios, requiring task-specific model designs and extensive domain-specific training data. In this study, we introduce UniST, a universal model designed for general urban spatio-temporal prediction across a wide range of scenarios. Inspired by large language models, UniST achieves success through: (i) utilizing diverse spatio-temporal data from different scenarios, (ii) effective pre-training to capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics, (iii) knowledge-guided prompts to enhance generalization capabilities. These designs together unlock the potential of building a universal model for various scenarios Extensive experiments on more than 20 spatio-temporal scenarios demonstrate UniST's efficacy in advancing state-of-the-art performance, especially in few-shot and zero-shot prediction.

In this work, we target enhancing VLMs with a fine-grained structural spatio-temporal alignment learning method (namely Finsta). First of all, we represent the input texts and videos with fine-grained scene graph (SG) structures, both of which are further unified into a holistic SG (HSG) for bridging two modalities. Then, an SG-based framework is built, where the textual SG (TSG) is encoded with a graph Transformer, while the video dynamic SG (DSG) and the HSG are modeled with a novel recurrent graph Transformer for spatial and temporal feature propagation. A spatial-temporal Gaussian differential graph Transformer is further devised to strengthen the sense of the changes in objects across spatial and temporal dimensions. Next, based on the fine-grained structural features of TSG and DSG, we perform object-centered spatial alignment and predicate-centered temporal alignment respectively, enhancing the video-language grounding in both the spatiality and temporality. We design our method as a plug&play system, which can be integrated into existing well-trained VLMs for further representation augmentation, without training from scratch or relying on SG annotations in downstream applications. On 6 representative VL modeling tasks over 12 datasets in both standard and long-form video scenarios, Finsta consistently improves the existing 13 strong-performing VLMs persistently, and refreshes the current state-of-the-art end task performance significantly in both the fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TPAMI 2024</p></details> |

However, current works for evaluating the spatio-temporal understanding capability of LLMs are somewhat limited and biased. These works either fail to incorporate the latest language models or only focus on assessing the memorized spatio-temporal knowledge. To address this gap, this paper dissects LLMs' capability of spatio-temporal data into four distinct dimensions: knowledge comprehension, spatio-temporal reasoning, accurate computation, and downstream applications. We curate several natural language question-answer tasks for each category and build the benchmark dataset, namely STBench, containing 13 distinct tasks and over 60,000 QA pairs. Moreover, we have assessed the capabilities of 13 LLMs, such as GPT-4o, Gemma and Mistral. Experimental results reveal that existing LLMs show remarkable performance on knowledge comprehension and spatio-temporal reasoning tasks, with potential for further enhancement on other tasks through in-context learning, chain-of-though prompting, and fine-tuning. The code and datasets of STBench are released on https://github.com/LwbXc/STBench.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in foundational models, particularly those employing self-attention mechanisms, have significantly enhanced our ability to comprehend the semantics of diverse data types. One such area that could highly benefit from multi-modality is in understanding geospatial data, which inherently has multiple modalities. However, current Natural Language Processing (NLP) mechanisms struggle to effectively address geospatial queries. Existing pre-trained LLMs are inadequately equipped to meet the unique demands of geospatial data, lacking the ability to retrieve precise spatio-temporal data in real-time, thus leading to significantly reduced accuracy in answering complex geospatial queries. To address these limitations, we introduce Geode--a pioneering system designed to tackle zero-shot geospatial question-answering tasks with high precision using spatio-temporal data retrieval. Our approach represents a significant improvement in addressing the limitations of current LLM models, demonstrating remarkable improvement in geospatial question-answering abilities compared to existing state-of-the-art pre-trained models.</p></details> |  |

While a few researchers focus on learning ice layer patterns from echogram images captured by airborne snow radar sensors via different convolutional neural networks, the noise in the echogram images proves to be a major obstacle. Instead, we focus on geometric deep learning based on graph neural networks to learn the spatio-temporal patterns from thickness information of shallow ice layers and make predictions for deep layers. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed hybrid graph neural network that combines the GraphSAGE framework for graph feature learning with the long short-term memory (LSTM) structure for learning temporal changes, and introduce measurements of physical ice properties from Model Atmospheric Regional (MAR) weather model as physical node features. We found that our proposed network can consistently outperform the current non-inductive or non-physical model in predicting deep ice layer thickness.</p></details> |  |

OFOS platforms offer dynamic allocation incentives to users and merchants through diverse marketing campaigns to encourage payments while maintaining the platforms' budget efficiency. Despite significant progress, the marketing domain continues to face two primary challenges: (i) how to allocate a limited budget with greater efficiency, demanding precision in predicting users' monotonic response (i.e. sensitivity) to incentives, and (ii) ensuring spatio-temporal adaptability and robustness in diverse marketing campaigns across different times and locations. To address these issues, we propose a Constrained Monotonic Adaptive Network (CoMAN) method for spatio-temporal perception within marketing pricing. Specifically, we capture spatio-temporal preferences within attribute features through two foundational spatio-temporal perception modules. To further enhance catching the user sensitivity differentials to incentives across varied times and locations, we design modules for learning spatio-temporal convexity and concavity as well as for expressing sensitivity functions. CoMAN can achieve a more efficient allocation of incentive investments during pricing, thus increasing the conversion rate and orders while maintaining budget efficiency. Extensive offline and online experimental results within our diverse marketing campaigns demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach while outperforming the monotonic state-of-the-art method.</p></details> | 7 pages |

Matrix factorization is employed to decompose spatio-temporal data into spatial and temporal components. To improve clarity in the temporal patterns, we introduce a nonnegativity constraint on the time domain along with regularization in the frequency domain. Specifically, regularization in the frequency domain involves selecting features in the frequency space, making an interpretation in the frequency domain more convenient. We propose two methods in the frequency domain: soft and hard regularizations, and provide convergence guarantees to first-order stationary points of the corresponding constrained optimization problem. While our primary motivation stems from geophysical data analysis based on GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) data, our methodology has the potential for wider application. Consequently, when applying our methodology to GRACE data, we find that the results with the proposed methodology are comparable to previous research in the field of geophysical sciences but offer clearer interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, Final version</p></details> |

Despite their advantages, a significant gap persists between real-world scenarios, where detection speed is critical, and existing proposals, which operate on large graphs representing several hours of traffic. This gap results in unrealistic operational conditions and impractical detection delays. Moreover, existing models do not generalize well across different networks, hampering their deployment in production environments. To address these issues, we introduce PPTGNN, a practical spatio-temporal GNN for intrusion detection. PPTGNN enables near real-time predictions, while better capturing the spatio-temporal dynamics of network attacks. PPTGNN employs self-supervised pre-training for improved performance and reduced dependency on labeled data. We evaluate PPTGNN on three public datasets and show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, such as E-ResGAT and E-GraphSAGE, with an average accuracy improvement of 10.38%. Finally, we show that a pre-trained PPTGNN can easily be fine-tuned to unseen networks with minimal labeled examples. This highlights the potential of PPTGNN as a general, large-scale pre-trained model that can effectively operate in diverse network environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper currently under review.

While limiting the variety of training data can make training easier, it can also lead to a lack of knowledge and information for the model, resulting in a decrease in performance. To address this challenge, we presented an innovative paradigm that incorporates three separate forms of curriculum learning specifically targeting from spatial, temporal, and quantile perspectives. Furthermore, our framework incorporates a stacking fusion module to combine diverse information from three types of curriculum learning, resulting in a strong and thorough learning process. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this framework with extensive empirical evaluations, highlighting its better performance in addressing complex ST challenges. We provided thorough ablation studies to investigate the effectiveness of our curriculum and to explain how it contributes to the improvement of learning efficiency on ST data.</p></details> |  |

Premature predictions may yield a higher rate of false alarms, whereas delaying predictions to gather more information can render them too late to be useful. In applications such as wildfires, crimes, and traffic jams, timely forecasting are vital for safeguarding human life and property. Consequently, finding a balance between accuracy and timeliness is crucial. In this paper, we propose an early spatio-temporal forecasting model based on Multi-Objective reinforcement learning that can either implement an optimal policy given a preference or infer the preference based on a small number of samples. The model addresses two primary challenges: 1) enhancing the accuracy of early forecasting and 2) providing the optimal policy for determining the most suitable prediction time for each area. Our method demonstrates superior performance on three large-scale real-world datasets, surpassing existing methods in early spatio-temporal forecasting tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted paper in KDD 2024</p></details> |

This paper proposes a Multi-level Multi-view Augmented Spatio-temporal Transformer (LVSTformer) for traffic prediction. The model aims to capture spatial dependencies from three different levels: local geographic, global semantic, and pivotal nodes, along with long- and short-term temporal dependencies. Specifically, we design three spatial augmented views to delve into the spatial information from the perspectives of local, global, and pivotal nodes. By combining three spatial augmented views with three parallel spatial self-attention mechanisms, the model can comprehensively captures spatial dependencies at different levels. We design a gated temporal self-attention mechanism to effectively capture long- and short-term temporal dependencies. Furthermore, a spatio-temporal context broadcasting module is introduced between two spatio-temporal layers to ensure a well-distributed allocation of attention scores, alleviating overfitting and information loss, and enhancing the generalization ability and robustness of the model. A comprehensive set of experiments is conducted on six well-known traffic benchmarks, the experimental results demonstrate that LVSTformer achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to competing baselines, with the maximum improvement reaching up to 4.32%.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we focus on NCA models used for texture synthesis, where the update rule is inspired by partial differential equations (PDEs) describing reaction-diffusion systems. To train the NCA model, the spatio-temporal domain is discretized, and Euler integration is used to numerically simulate the PDE. However, whether a trained NCA truly learns the continuous dynamic described by the corresponding PDE or merely overfits the discretization used in training remains an open question. We study NCA models at the limit where space-time discretization approaches continuity. We find that existing NCA models tend to overfit the training discretization, especially in the proximity of the initial condition, also called "seed". To address this, we propose a solution that utilizes uniform noise as the initial condition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in preserving the consistency of NCA dynamics across a wide range of spatio-temporal granularities. Our improved NCA model enables two new test-time interactions by allowing continuous control over the speed of pattern formation and the scale of the synthesized patterns. We demonstrate this new NCA feature in our interactive online demo. Our work reveals that NCA models can learn continuous dynamics and opens new venues for NCA research from a dynamical system's perspective.</p></details> | 9 pages, 12 figures |

Specifically, in the context of estimation, we seek the most likely evolution realizing measured spatio-temporal marginals of killed particles. In the context of control, we seek a suitable control action directing the killed process toward spatio-temporal probabilistic constraints. To this end, we derive a new Schr\"odinger system of coupled, in space and time, partial differential equations to construct the solution of the proposed problem. Further, we show that a Fortet-Sinkhorn type of algorithm is available to attain the associated bridge. A key feature of our framework is that the obtained bridge retains the Markovian structure in the prior process, and thereby, the corresponding controller takes the form of state feedback.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |

Mainstream approaches employ bidirectional feature propagation, spatio-temporal transformers, or a combination of both to extract information from the video sequence. However, limitations in memory and computational resources constraints the temporal window length of the spatio-temporal transformer, preventing the extraction of longer temporal contextual information from the video sequence. Additionally, bidirectional feature propagation is highly sensitive to inaccurate optical flow in blurry frames, leading to error accumulation during the propagation process. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{BSSTNet}, \textbf{B}lur-aware \textbf{S}patio-temporal \textbf{S}parse \textbf{T}ransformer Network. It introduces the blur map, which converts the originally dense attention into a sparse form, enabling a more extensive utilization of information throughout the entire video sequence. Specifically, BSSTNet (1) uses a longer temporal window in the transformer, leveraging information from more distant frames to restore the blurry pixels in the current frame. (2) introduces bidirectional feature propagation guided by blur maps, which reduces error accumulation caused by the blur frame. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed BSSTNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the GoPro and DVD datasets.</p></details> | CVPR 2024 |

Spatio-temporal data, on the other hand, is vital for analyzing phenomena in both space and time, providing a dynamic perspective on complex system interactions. Recently, diffusion models have seen widespread application in time series and spatio-temporal data mining. Not only do they enhance the generative and inferential capabilities for sequential and temporal data, but they also extend to other downstream tasks. In this survey, we comprehensively and thoroughly review the use of diffusion models in time series and spatio-temporal data, categorizing them by model category, task type, data modality, and practical application domain. In detail, we categorize diffusion models into unconditioned and conditioned types and discuss time series and spatio-temporal data separately. Unconditioned models, which operate unsupervised, are subdivided into probability-based and score-based models, serving predictive and generative tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, and imputation. Conditioned models, on the other hand, utilize extra information to enhance performance and are similarly divided for both predictive and generative tasks. Our survey extensively covers their application in various fields, including healthcare, recommendation, climate, energy, audio, and transportation, providing a foundational understanding of how these models analyze and generate data.

However, significant individual variation in the organisation of the human cerebral cortex makes it difficult to identify population-level trends in these signals. Recently, Surface Vision Transformers (SiTs) have emerged as a promising approach for modelling cortical signals, yet they face some limitations in low-data scenarios due to the lack of inductive biases in their architecture. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the surface Masked AutoEncoder (sMAE) and video surface Masked AutoEncoder (vsMAE) - for multivariate and spatio-temporal pre-training of cortical signals over regular icosahedral grids. These models are trained to reconstruct cortical feature maps from masked versions of the input by learning strong latent representations of cortical structure and function. Such representations translate into better modelling of individual phenotypes and enhanced performance in downstream tasks. The proposed approach was evaluated on cortical phenotype regression using data from the young adult Human Connectome Project (HCP) and developing HCP (dHCP). Results show that (v)sMAE pre-trained models improve phenotyping prediction performance on multiple tasks by $\ge 26\%$, and offer faster convergence relative to models trained from scratch. Finally, we show that pre-training vision transformers on large datasets, such as the UK Biobank (UKB), supports transfer learning to low-data regimes. Our code and pre-trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/metrics-lab/surface-masked-autoencoders .</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publications for MIDL 2024; 20 figures; 7 figures</p></details> |

However, tackling the video camouflage object detection (VCOD) task presents a unique challenge. Camouflaged objects typically blend into the background, making them difficult to distinguish in still images. Additionally, ensuring temporal consistency in this context is a challenging problem. As a result, SAM encounters limitations and falls short when applied to the VCOD task. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new method called the SAM Propagation Module (SAM-PM). Our propagation module enforces temporal consistency within SAM by employing spatio-temporal cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, we exclusively train the propagation module while keeping the SAM network weights frozen, allowing us to integrate task-specific insights with the vast knowledge accumulated by the large model. Our method effectively incorporates temporal consistency and domain-specific expertise into the segmentation network with an addition of less than 1% of SAM's parameters. Extensive experimentation reveals a substantial performance improvement in the VCOD benchmark when compared to the most recent state-of-the-art techniques. Code and pre-trained weights are open-sourced at https://github.com/SpiderNitt/SAM-PM</p></details> |  |

The prediction of the remaining useful life (RUL) of batteries is crucial for ensuring reliable and efficient operation, as well as reducing maintenance costs. However, determining the life cycle of batteries in real-world scenarios is challenging, and existing methods have limitations in predicting the number of cycles iteratively. In addition, existing works often oversimplify the datasets, neglecting important features of the batteries such as temperature, internal resistance, and material type. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a two-stage RUL prediction scheme for Lithium-ion batteries using a spatio-temporal multimodal attention network (ST-MAN). The proposed ST-MAN is to capture the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in the battery data, including the features that are often neglected in existing works. Despite operating without prior knowledge of end-of-life (EOL) events, our method consistently achieves lower error rates, boasting mean absolute error (MAE) and mean square error (MSE) of 0.0275 and 0.0014, respectively, compared to existing convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM)-based methods. The proposed method has the potential to improve the reliability and efficiency of battery operations and is applicable in various industries.</p></details> |  |

We propose novel approaches to improve mesh-agnostic spatio-temporal prediction of transient flow fields using graph U-Nets, enabling accurate prediction on diverse mesh configurations. Key enhancements to the graph U-Net architecture, including the Gaussian mixture model convolutional operator and noise injection approaches, provide increased flexibility in modeling node dynamics: the former reduces prediction error by 95\% compared to conventional convolutional operators, while the latter improves long-term prediction robustness, resulting in an error reduction of 86\%. We also investigate transductive and inductive-learning perspectives of graph U-Nets with proposed improvements. In the transductive setting, they effectively predict quantities for unseen nodes within the trained graph. In the inductive setting, they successfully perform in mesh scenarios with different vortex-shedding periods, showing 98\% improvement in predicting the future flow fields compared to a model trained without the inductive settings. It is found that graph U-Nets without pooling operations, i.e. without reducing and restoring the node dimensionality of the graph data, perform better in inductive settings due to their ability to learn from the detailed structure of each graph. Meanwhile, we also discover that the choice of normalization technique significantly impacts graph U-Net performance.</p></details> |  |

Considering the sparsity of data due to the high maintenance cost of the stations, good inference algorithms can effectively save the cost and refine the data granularity. While spatio-temporal graph neural networks have made excellent progress on this problem, their non-Euclidean and discrete data structure modeling of reality limits its potential. In this work, we make the first attempt to combine two different spatio-temporal perspectives, fields and graphs, by proposing a new model, Spatio-Temporal Field Neural Network, and its corresponding new framework, Pyramidal Inference.

Although these methods have shown some potential in creating immersive experiences, two drawbacks limit their ubiquity: (i) a significant reduction in reconstruction quality when the computing budget is limited, and (ii) a lack of semantic understanding of the underlying scenes. To address these issues, we introduce Gear-NeRF, which leverages semantic information from powerful image segmentation models. Our approach presents a principled way for learning a spatio-temporal (4D) semantic embedding, based on which we introduce the concept of gears to allow for stratified modeling of dynamic regions of the scene based on the extent of their motion. Such differentiation allows us to adjust the spatio-temporal sampling resolution for each region in proportion to its motion scale, achieving more photo-realistic dynamic novel view synthesis. At the same time, almost for free, our approach enables free-viewpoint tracking of objects of interest - a functionality not yet achieved by existing NeRF-based methods. Empirical studies validate the effectiveness of our method, where we achieve state-of-the-art rendering and tracking performance on multiple challenging datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to IEEE/CVF CVPR 2024 (Spotlight).

Computations are done through a Gaussian Markov random field approximation of the solution of the SPDE, which is constructed through a finite volume method. The new flexible non-separable model is compared to a flexible separable model both for reconstruction and forecasting and evaluated in terms of root mean square errors and continuous rank probability scores. A simulation study demonstrates that the non-separable model performs better when the data is simulated with non-separable effects such as diffusion and advection. Further, we estimate surrogate models for emulating the output of a ocean model in Trondheimsfjorden, Norway, and simulate observations of autonoumous underwater vehicles. The results show that the flexible non-separable model outperforms the flexible separable model for real-time prediction of unobserved locations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autaptic Synaptic Circuit Enhances Spatio-temporal Predictive Learning of Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00405v2)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) emulate the integrated-fire-leak mechanism found in biological neurons, offering a compelling combination of biological realism and energy efficiency. In recent years, they have gained considerable research interest. However, existing SNNs predominantly rely on the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model and are primarily suited for simple, static tasks. They lack the ability to effectively model long-term temporal dependencies and facilitate spatial information interaction, which is crucial for tackling complex, dynamic spatio-temporal prediction tasks. To tackle these challenges, this paper draws inspiration from the concept of autaptic synapses in biology and proposes a novel Spatio-Temporal Circuit (STC) model. The STC model integrates two learnable adaptive pathways, enhancing the spiking neurons' temporal memory and spatial coordination. We conduct a theoretical analysis of the dynamic parameters in the STC model, highlighting their contribution in establishing long-term memory and mitigating the issue of gradient vanishing. Through extensive experiments on multiple spatio-temporal prediction datasets, we demonstrate that our model outperforms other adaptive models. Furthermore, our model is compatible with existing spiking neuron models, thereby augmenting their dynamic representations. In essence, our work enriches the specificity and topological complexity of SNNs.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML2024 |

The existing video adversarial attack methods mainly take a gradient-based approach and generate adversarial videos with noticeable perturbations. In this paper, we propose a novel Sparse Adversarial Video Attack via Spatio-Temporal Invertible Neural Networks (SVASTIN) to generate adversarial videos through spatio-temporal feature space information exchanging. It consists of a Guided Target Video Learning (GTVL) module to balance the perturbation budget and optimization speed and a Spatio-Temporal Invertible Neural Network (STIN) module to perform spatio-temporal feature space information exchanging between a source video and the target feature tensor learned by GTVL module. Extensive experiments on UCF-101 and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our proposed SVASTIN can generate adversarial examples with higher imperceptibility than the state-of-the-art methods with the higher fooling rate.

Many recent studies have concentrated on meticulously reconciling various advantages, leading to designed models that are neither simple nor practical. To address this issue, this paper presents a systematic study on existing shortcomings faced by off-the-shelf models, including lack of local fidelity, poor prediction performance over long time-steps,low scalability, and inefficiency. To systematically address the aforementioned problems, we propose an EarthFarseer, a concise framework that combines parallel local convolutions and global Fourier-based transformer architectures, enabling dynamically capture the local-global spatial interactions and dependencies. EarthFarseer also incorporates a multi-scale fully convolutional and Fourier architectures to efficiently and effectively capture the temporal evolution. Our proposal demonstrates strong adaptability across various tasks and datasets, with fast convergence and better local fidelity in long time-steps predictions. Extensive experiments and visualizations over eight human society physical and natural physical datasets demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance of EarthFarseer.

Consequently, methods for predicting and preventing traffic accidents have been researched for many years. With advancements in the field of artificial intelligence, various studies have applied Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to traffic accident prediction. Modern traffic conditions change rapidly by the minute, and these changes vary significantly across different roads. In other words, the risk of traffic accidents changes minute by minute in various patterns for each road. Therefore, it is desirable to predict traffic accident risk at the Minute-Level and Road-Level. However, because roads have close and complex relationships with adjacent roads, research on predicting traffic accidents at the Minute-Level and Road-Level is challenging. Thus, it is essential to build a model that can reflect the spatial and temporal characteristics of roads for traffic accident prediction. Consequently, recent attempts have been made to use Graph Convolutional Networks to capture the spatial characteristics of roads and Recurrent Neural Networks to capture their temporal characteristics for predicting traffic accident risk. This paper proposes the Sequential based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (SST-GCN), which combines GCN and LSTM, to predict traffic accidents at the Minute-Level and Road-Level using a road dataset constructed in Seoul, the capital of South Korea. Experiments have demonstrated that SST-GCN outperforms other state-of-the-art models in Minute-Level predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19121v2)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial Message Passing Graph Neural Networks (MPGNNs) are widely used for learning on graph-structured data. However, key limitations of l-step MPGNNs are that their "receptive field" is typically limited to the l-hop neighborhood of a node and that information exchange between distant nodes is limited by over-squashing. Motivated by these limitations, we propose Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Networks (S$^2$GNNs) -- a new modeling paradigm for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that synergistically combines spatially and spectrally parametrized graph filters. Parameterizing filters partially in the frequency domain enables global yet efficient information propagation. We show that S$^2$GNNs vanquish over-squashing and yield strictly tighter approximation-theoretic error bounds than MPGNNs. Further, rethinking graph convolutions at a fundamental level unlocks new design spaces. For example, S$^2$GNNs allow for free positional encodings that make them strictly more expressive than the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test. Moreover, to obtain general-purpose S$^2$GNNs, we propose spectrally parametrized filters for directed graphs. S$^2$GNNs outperform spatial MPGNNs, graph transformers, and graph rewirings, e.g., on the peptide long-range benchmark tasks, and are competitive with state-of-the-art sequence modeling. On a 40 GB GPU, S$^2$GNNs scale to millions of nodes.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 27 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

| **[EmbodiedSAM: Online Segment Any 3D Thing in Real Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11811v1)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied tasks require the agent to fully understand 3D scenes simultaneously with its exploration, so an online, real-time, fine-grained and highly-generalized 3D perception model is desperately needed. Since high-quality 3D data is limited, directly training such a model in 3D is almost infeasible. Meanwhile, vision foundation models (VFM) has revolutionized the field of 2D computer vision with superior performance, which makes the use of VFM to assist embodied 3D perception a promising direction. However, most existing VFM-assisted 3D perception methods are either offline or too slow that cannot be applied in practical embodied tasks. In this paper, we aim to leverage Segment Anything Model (SAM) for real-time 3D instance segmentation in an online setting. This is a challenging problem since future frames are not available in the input streaming RGB-D video, and an instance may be observed in several frames so object matching between frames is required. To address these challenges, we first propose a geometric-aware query lifting module to represent the 2D masks generated by SAM by 3D-aware queries, which is then iteratively refined by a dual-level query decoder. In this way, the 2D masks are transferred to fine-grained shapes on 3D point clouds. Benefit from the query representation for 3D masks, we can compute the similarity matrix between the 3D masks from different views by efficient matrix operation, which enables real-time inference. Experiments on ScanNet, ScanNet200, SceneNN and 3RScan show our method achieves leading performance even compared with offline methods. Our method also demonstrates great generalization ability in several zero-shot dataset transferring experiments and show great potential in open-vocabulary and data-efficient setting. Code and demo are available at https://xuxw98.github.io/ESAM/, with only one RTX 3090 GPU required for training and evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://xuxw98.github.io/ESAM/</p></details> |

With hundreds of billion parameters, transformer-based LLMs necessitate months of pretraining across a high-end GPU cluster. However, this paper reveals a compelling finding: transformers exhibit considerable redundancy in pretraining computations, which motivates our proposed solution, Mixed Sparsity Training (MST), an efficient pretraining method that can reduce about $75\%$ of Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) while maintaining performance. MST integrates dynamic sparse training (DST) with Sparsity Variation (SV) and Hybrid Sparse Attention (HSA) during pretraining, involving three distinct phases: warm-up, ultra-sparsification, and restoration. The warm-up phase transforms the dense model into a sparse one, and the restoration phase reinstates connections. Throughout these phases, the model is trained with a dynamically evolving sparse topology and an HSA mechanism to maintain performance and minimize training FLOPs concurrently. Our experiment on GPT-2 showcases a FLOP reduction of $4\times$ without compromising performance.</p></details> |  |

Many different regularization approaches have been proposed to improve numerical results and provide unique results. This work presents a novel approach for reconstructing the epicardial potential from body surface potential maps based on a space-time total variation-type regularization using finite elements, where a first-order primal-dual algorithm solves the underlying convex optimization problem. In several numerical experiments, the superior performance of this method and the benefit of space-time regularization for the reconstruction of epicardial potential on two-dimensional torso data and a three-dimensional rabbit heart compared to state-of-the-art methods are demonstrated.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inference-Time Selective Debiasing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19345v2)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose selective debiasing -- an inference-time safety mechanism that aims to increase the overall quality of models in terms of prediction performance and fairness in the situation when re-training a model is prohibitive. The method is inspired by selective prediction, where some predictions that are considered low quality are discarded at inference time. In our approach, we identify the potentially biased model predictions and, instead of discarding them, we debias them using LEACE -- a post-processing debiasing method. To select problematic predictions, we propose a bias quantification approach based on KL divergence, which achieves better results than standard UQ methods. Experiments with text classification datasets demonstrate that selective debiasing helps to close the performance gap between post-processing methods and at-training and pre-processing debiasing techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph-based Time Series Clustering for End-to-End Hierarchical Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19183v2)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relationships among time series can be exploited as inductive biases in learning effective forecasting models. In hierarchical time series, relationships among subsets of sequences induce hard constraints (hierarchical inductive biases) on the predicted values. In this paper, we propose a graph-based methodology to unify relational and hierarchical inductive biases in the context of deep learning for time series forecasting. In particular, we model both types of relationships as dependencies in a pyramidal graph structure, with each pyramidal layer corresponding to a level of the hierarchy. By exploiting modern - trainable - graph pooling operators we show that the hierarchical structure, if not available as a prior, can be learned directly from data, thus obtaining cluster assignments aligned with the forecasting objective. A differentiable reconciliation stage is incorporated into the processing architecture, allowing hierarchical constraints to act both as an architectural bias as well as a regularization element for predictions. Simulation results on representative datasets show that the proposed method compares favorably against the state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICML 2024</p></details> |

However, traditional RS relies on collaborative signals, which lacks semantic understanding to real-time scenes. We also noticed that a major challenge in utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for practical recommendation purposes is their efficiency in dealing with long text input. To break through the problems above, we propose Large Language Model Aided Real-time Scene Recommendation(LARR), adopt LLMs for semantic understanding, utilizing real-time scene information in RS without requiring LLM to process the entire real-time scene text directly, thereby enhancing the efficiency of LLM-based CTR modeling. Specifically, recommendation domain-specific knowledge is injected into LLM and then RS employs an aggregation encoder to build real-time scene information from separate LLM's outputs. Firstly, a LLM is continual pretrained on corpus built from recommendation data with the aid of special tokens. Subsequently, the LLM is fine-tuned via contrastive learning on three kinds of sample construction strategies. Through this step, LLM is transformed into a text embedding model. Finally, LLM's separate outputs for different scene features are aggregated by an encoder, aligning to collaborative signals in RS, enhancing the performance of recommendation model.</p></details> |  |

One of the popular approaches to tackle this problem is learning-based methods, but dealing with the test cases unfamiliar with training data (Out-of-distribution; OoD) introduces an additional challenge. To adapt for unseen samples in test time, we propose MeTTA, a test-time adaptation (TTA) exploiting generative prior. We design joint optimization of 3D geometry, appearance, and pose to handle OoD cases with only a single view image. However, the alignment between the reference image and the 3D shape via the estimated viewpoint could be erroneous, which leads to ambiguity. To address this ambiguity, we carefully design learnable virtual cameras and their self-calibration. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MeTTA effectively deals with OoD scenarios at failure cases of existing learning-based 3D reconstruction models and enables obtaining a realistic appearance with physically based rendering (PBR) textures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at BMVC 2024.

In many applications, the data grows dynamically, requiring their filters to expand along with the data. However, existing methods for expanding filters cannot maintain stable performance, memory footprint, and false positive rate (FPR) simultaneously. We address this problem with Aleph Filter, which makes the following contributions. (1) It supports all operations (insertions, queries, deletes, etc.) in constant time, no matter how much the data grows. (2) Given an estimate of how much the data will ultimately grow, Aleph Filter provides a memory vs. FPR trade-offs on par with static filters.</p></details> |  |

Despite the excessive applications of DFrFT, implementation of corresponding fractional orders in the baseband signal often leads to bulky, power-hungry, and high-latency systems. In this paper, we present a passive metamaterial coupled lines network (MCLN) that performs the analog DFrFT in real-time at microwave frequencies. The proposed MCLN consists of M parallel microstrip transmission lines (TLs) in which adjacent TLs are loaded with interdigital capacitors to enhance the coupling level. We show that with proper design of the coupling coefficients between adjacent channels, the MCLN can perform an M-point DFrFT of an arbitrary fractional order that can be designed through the length of the network. In the context of real-time signal processing for realization of DFrFT, we design, model, simulate and implement a 16x16 MCLN and experimentally demonstrate the performance of the proposed structure. The proposed innovative approach is versatile and is capable to be used in various applications where DFrFT is an essential tool. The proposed design scheme based on MCLN is scalable across the frequency spectrum and can be applied to millimeter and submillimeter wave systems.</p></details> |  |

However, addressing such distribution shifts in the tabular domain has been relatively underexplored due to unique challenges such as varying attributes and dataset sizes, as well as the limited representation learning capabilities of deep learning models for tabular data. Particularly, with the recent promising paradigm of test-time adaptation (TTA), where we adapt the off-the-shelf model to the unlabeled target domain during the inference phase without accessing the source domain, we observe that directly adopting commonly used TTA methods from other domains often leads to model collapse. We systematically explore challenges in tabular data test-time adaptation, including skewed entropy, complex latent space decision boundaries, confidence calibration issues with both overconfident and under-confident, and model bias towards source label distributions along with class imbalances. Based on these insights, we introduce AdapTable, a novel tabular test-time adaptation method that directly modifies output probabilities by estimating target label distributions and adjusting initial probabilities based on calibrated uncertainty. Extensive experiments on both natural distribution shifts and synthetic corruptions demonstrate the adaptation efficacy of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review at AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[KAN4TSF: Are KAN and KAN-based models Effective for Time Series Forecasting?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11306v1)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is a crucial task that predicts the future values of variables based on historical data. Time series forecasting techniques have been developing in parallel with the machine learning community, from early statistical learning methods to current deep learning methods. Although existing methods have made significant progress, they still suffer from two challenges. The mathematical theory of mainstream deep learning-based methods does not establish a clear relation between network sizes and fitting capabilities, and these methods often lack interpretability. To this end, we introduce the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) into time series forecasting research, which has better mathematical properties and interpretability. First, we propose the Reversible Mixture of KAN experts (RMoK) model, which is a KAN-based model for time series forecasting. RMoK uses a mixture-of-experts structure to assign variables to KAN experts. Then, we compare performance, integration, and speed between RMoK and various baselines on real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that RMoK achieves the best performance in most cases. And we find the relationship between temporal feature weights and data periodicity through visualization, which roughly explains RMoK's mechanism. Thus, we conclude that KAN and KAN-based models (RMoK) are effective in time series forecasting. Code is available at KAN4TSF: https://github.com/2448845600/KAN4TSF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Correlation Analysis of Adversarial Attack in Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11264v1)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the vulnerability of time series classification models to adversarial attacks, with a focus on how these models process local versus global information under such conditions. By leveraging the Normalized Auto Correlation Function (NACF), an exploration into the inclination of neural networks is conducted. It is demonstrated that regularization techniques, particularly those employing Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) methods and targeting frequency components of perturbations, markedly enhance the effectiveness of attacks. Meanwhile, the defense strategies, like noise introduction and Gaussian filtering, are shown to significantly lower the Attack Success Rate (ASR), with approaches based on noise introducing notably effective in countering high-frequency distortions. Furthermore, models designed to prioritize global information are revealed to possess greater resistance to adversarial manipulations. These results underline the importance of designing attack and defense mechanisms, informed by frequency domain analysis, as a means to considerably reinforce the resilience of neural network models against adversarial threats.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Bayesian Learning of Relational Graph in Semiparametric High-dimensional Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04915v3)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data arising in many applications nowadays are high-dimensional. A large number of parameters describe features of these time series. We propose a novel approach to modeling a high-dimensional time series through several independent univariate time series, which are then orthogonally rotated and sparsely linearly transformed. With this approach, any specified intrinsic relations among component time series given by a graphical structure can be maintained at all time snapshots. We call the resulting process an Orthogonally-rotated Univariate Time series (OUT). Key structural properties of time series such as stationarity and causality can be easily accommodated in the OUT model. For Bayesian inference, we put suitable prior distributions on the spectral densities of the independent latent times series, the orthogonal rotation matrix, and the common precision matrix of the component times series at every time point. A likelihood is constructed using the Whittle approximation for univariate latent time series. An efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is developed for posterior computation. We study the convergence of the pseudo-posterior distribution based on the Whittle likelihood for the model's parameters upon developing a new general posterior convergence theorem for pseudo-posteriors. We find that the posterior contraction rate for independent observations essentially prevails in the OUT model under very mild conditions on the temporal dependence described in terms of the smoothness of the corresponding spectral densities. Through a simulation study, we compare the accuracy of estimating the parameters and identifying the graphical structure with other approaches. We apply the proposed methodology to analyze a dataset on different industrial components of the US gross domestic product between 2010 and 2019 and predict future observations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Guarantees for Online Selection Over Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11224v1)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prophet inequalities are a cornerstone in optimal stopping and online decision-making. Traditionally, they involve the sequential observation of $n$ non-negative independent random variables and face irrevocable accept-or-reject choices. The goal is to provide policies that provide a good approximation ratio against the optimal offline solution that can access all the values upfront -- the so-called prophet value. In the prophet inequality over time problem (POT), the decision-maker can commit to an accepted value for $\tau$ units of time, during which no new values can be accepted. This creates a trade-off between the duration of commitment and the opportunity to capture potentially higher future values. In this work, we provide best possible worst-case approximation ratios in the IID setting of POT for single-threshold algorithms and the optimal dynamic programming policy. We show a single-threshold algorithm that achieves an approximation ratio of $(1+e^{-2})/2\approx 0.567$, and we prove that no single-threshold algorithm can surpass this guarantee. With our techniques, we can analyze simple algorithms using $k$ thresholds and show that with $k=3$ it is possible to get an approximation ratio larger than $\approx 0.602$. Then, for each $n$, we prove it is possible to compute the tight worst-case approximation ratio of the optimal dynamic programming policy for instances with $n$ values by solving a convex optimization program. A limit analysis of the first-order optimality conditions yields a nonlinear differential equation showing that the optimal dynamic programming policy's asymptotic worst-case approximation ratio is $\approx 0.618$. Finally, we extend the discussion to adversarial settings and show an optimal worst-case approximation ratio of $\approx 0.162$ when the values are streamed in random order.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovery of Generalizable TBI Phenotypes Using Multivariate Time-Series Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08002v2)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) presents a broad spectrum of clinical presentations and outcomes due to its inherent heterogeneity, leading to diverse recovery trajectories and varied therapeutic responses. While many studies have delved into TBI phenotyping for distinct patient populations, identifying TBI phenotypes that consistently generalize across various settings and populations remains a critical research gap. Our research addresses this by employing multivariate time-series clustering to unveil TBI's dynamic intricates. Utilizing a self-supervised learning-based approach to clustering multivariate time-Series data with missing values (SLAC-Time), we analyzed both the research-centric TRACK-TBI and the real-world MIMIC-IV datasets. Remarkably, the optimal hyperparameters of SLAC-Time and the ideal number of clusters remained consistent across these datasets, underscoring SLAC-Time's stability across heterogeneous datasets. Our analysis revealed three generalizable TBI phenotypes ({\alpha}, \b{eta}, and {\gamma}), each exhibiting distinct non-temporal features during emergency department visits, and temporal feature profiles throughout ICU stays. Specifically, phenotype {\alpha} represents mild TBI with a remarkably consistent clinical presentation. In contrast, phenotype \b{eta} signifies severe TBI with diverse clinical manifestations, and phenotype {\gamma} represents a moderate TBI profile in terms of severity and clinical diversity. Age is a significant determinant of TBI outcomes, with older cohorts recording higher mortality rates. Importantly, while certain features varied by age, the core characteristics of TBI manifestations tied to each phenotype remain consistent across diverse populations.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Time delay phenomena frequently arise in various real-world systems, making their accurate modeling and simulation crucial for understanding and prediction. We consider a series of model problems, ranging from Parabolic, Hyperbolic to Neutral PDEs with time delay and apply the iterative techniques DNWR and NNWR for solving in parallel. We present the theoretical foundations, numerical implementation, and comparative performance analysis of these two methods. Through numerical experiments and simulations, we explore their convergence properties, computational efficiency, and applicability to various types of PDEs with time delay.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-time small-area estimation of oil and gas production capacity by Bayesian multilevel modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11167v1)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a Bayesian multilevel modeling approach for estimating well-level oil and gas production capacities across multiple time periods within small geographic areas. Focusing on basins, which are economically significant drilling regions, we model the latent production capacity of wells using small-area estimation techniques. Our model accounts for well-level variations within these basins, incorporating factors such as lateral length, water usage, and sand usage. A key aspect of our methodology is the use of the Maidenhead Coordinate System to define small areas, enabling detailed regional analysis. The model was developed and validated using data from the Eagle Ford region, covering the years 2014 to 2019, and demonstrates strong predictive performance, particularly in handling small sample sizes. We expand the model to accommodate temporal dynamics by introducing time-effect parameters, allowing for the analysis of production trends over time. Additionally, we explore the impact of technological advancements by modeling water-sand intensity as a proxy for production efficiency. Our findings suggest that Bayesian multilevel modeling provides robust and flexible tools for understanding and predicting oil and gas production at a granular level, offering valuable insights for energy production forecasting and resource management.</p></details> | 21 pages, 9 charts |
| **[Discriminant Analysis in stationary time series based on robust cepstral coefficients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11012v1)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis is crucial in fields like finance, economics, environmental science, and biomedical engineering, aiding in forecasting, pattern identification, and understanding underlying mechanisms. While traditional time-domain methods focus on trends and seasonality, they often miss periodicities better captured in the frequency domain. Analyzing time series in the frequency domain uncovers spectral properties, offering deeper insights into underlying processes, aiding in differentiating data-generating processes of various populations, and assisting in classification. Common approaches use smoothed estimators, such as the smoothed periodogram, to minimize bias by averaging spectra from individual replicates within a population. However, these methods struggle with spectral variability among replicates, and abrupt values can skew estimators, complicating discrimination and classification. There's a gap in the literature for methods that account for within-population spectral variability, separate white noise effects from autocorrelations, and employ robust estimators in the presence of outliers. This paper fills that gap by introducing a robust framework for classifying time series groups. The process involves transforming time series into the frequency domain using the Fourier Transform, computing the power spectrum, and using the inverse Fourier Transform to obtain the cepstrum. To enhance spectral estimates' robustness and consistency, we apply the multitaper periodogram and the M-periodogram. These features are then used in Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to improve classification accuracy and interpretability, offering a powerful tool for precise temporal pattern distinction and resilience to data anomalies.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is the result of thesis defens presented to ICEX in UFMG contanning 39 pages and 17 figures</p></details> |

In time series forecasting (TSF), where accurate predictions are crucial in fields like finance, healthcare, and manufacturing, traditional augmentation methods for classification tasks are insufficient to maintain temporal coherence. This research introduces two augmentation approaches using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to adjust frequency elements while preserving temporal dependencies in time series data. Our methods, Wavelet Masking (WaveMask) and Wavelet Mixing (WaveMix), are evaluated against established baselines across various forecasting horizons. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to conduct extensive experiments on multivariate time series using Discrete Wavelet Transform as an augmentation technique. Experimental results demonstrate that our techniques achieve competitive results with previous methods. We also explore cold-start forecasting using downsampled training datasets, comparing outcomes to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Complexity of Broadcast and Consensus for Randomized Oblivious Message Adversaries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11988v2)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Broadcast and consensus are most fundamental tasks in distributed computing. These tasks are particularly challenging in dynamic networks where communication across the network links may be unreliable, e.g., due to mobility or failures. Indeed, over the last years, researchers have derived several impossibility results and high time complexity lower bounds (i.e., linear in the number of nodes $n$) for these tasks, even for oblivious message adversaries where communication networks are rooted trees. However, such deterministic adversarial models may be overly conservative, as many processes in real-world settings are stochastic in nature rather than worst case. This paper initiates the study of broadcast and consensus on stochastic dynamic networks, introducing a randomized oblivious message adversary. Our model is reminiscent of the SI model in epidemics, however, revolving around trees (which renders the analysis harder due to the apparent lack of independence). In particular, we show that if information dissemination occurs along random rooted trees, broadcast and consensus complete fast with high probability, namely in logarithmic time. Our analysis proves the independence of a key variable, which enables a formal understanding of the dissemination process. More formally, for a network with $n$ nodes, we first consider the completely random case where in each round the communication network is chosen uniformly at random among rooted trees. We then introduce the notion of randomized oblivious message adversary, where in each round, an adversary can choose $k$ edges to appear in the communication network, and then a rooted tree is chosen uniformly at random among the set of all rooted trees that include these edges. We show that broadcast completes in $O(k+\log n)$ rounds, and that this it is also the case for consensus as long as $k \le 0.1n$.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages + 13 pages of appendix.

| **[Near-linear Time Dispersion of Mobile Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04376v3)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consider that there are $k\le n$ agents in a simple, connected, and undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges. The goal of the dispersion problem is to move these $k$ agents to mutually distinct nodes. Agents can communicate only when they are at the same node, and no other communication means, such as whiteboards, are available. We assume that the agents operate synchronously. We consider two scenarios: when all agents are initially located at a single node (rooted setting) and when they are initially distributed over one or more nodes (general setting). Kshemkalyani and Sharma presented a dispersion algorithm for the general setting, which uses $O(m_k)$ time and $\log(k + \Delta)$ bits of memory per agent [OPODIS 2021], where $m_k$ is the maximum number of edges in any induced subgraph of $G$ with $k$ nodes, and $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of $G$. This algorithm is currently the fastest in the literature, as no $o(m_k)$-time algorithm has been discovered, even for the rooted setting. In this paper, we present significantly faster algorithms for both the rooted and the general settings. First, we present an algorithm for the rooted setting that solves the dispersion problem in $O(k\log \min(k,\Delta))=O(k\log k)$ time using $O(\log (k+\Delta))$ bits of memory per agent. Next, we propose an algorithm for the general setting that achieves dispersion in $O(k \log k \cdot \log \min(k,\Delta))=O(k \log^2 k)$ time using $O(\log (k+\Delta))$ bits. Finally, for the rooted setting, we give a time-optimal (i.e.,~$O(k)$-time) algorithm with $O(\Delta+\log k)$ bits of space per agent. All algorithms presented in this paper work only in the synchronous setting, while several algorithms in the literature, including the one given by Kshemkalyani and Sharma at OPODIS 2021, work in the asynchronous setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Computing Krylov iterates in the time of matrix multiplication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07345v2)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Krylov methods rely on iterated matrix-vector products $A^k u_j$ for an $n\times n$ matrix $A$ and vectors $u_1,\ldots,u_m$. The space spanned by all iterates $A^k u_j$ admits a particular basis -- the \emph{maximal Krylov basis} -- which consists of iterates of the first vector $u_1, Au_1, A^2u_1,\ldots$, until reaching linear dependency, then iterating similarly the subsequent vectors until a basis is obtained. Finding minimal polynomials and Frobenius normal forms is closely related to computing maximal Krylov bases. The fastest way to produce these bases was, until this paper, Keller-Gehrig's 1985 algorithm whose complexity bound $O(n^\omega \log(n))$ comes from repeated squarings of $A$ and logarithmically many Gaussian eliminations. Here $\omega>2$ is a feasible exponent for matrix multiplication over the base field. We present an algorithm computing the maximal Krylov basis in $O(n^\omega\log\log(n))$ field operations when $m \in O(n)$, and even $O(n^\omega)$ as soon as $m\in O(n/\log(n)^c)$ for some fixed real $c>0$. As a consequence, we show that the Frobenius normal form together with a transformation matrix can be computed deterministically in $O(n^\omega (\log\log(n))^2)$, and therefore matrix exponentiation~$A^k$ can be performed in the latter complexity if $\log(k) \in O(n^{\omega-1-\varepsilon})$ for some fixed $\varepsilon>0$. A key idea for these improvements is to rely on fast algorithms for $m\times m$ polynomial matrices of average degree $n/m$, involving high-order lifting and minimal kernel bases.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 algorithms</p></details> |
| **[Pluto and Charon: A Time and Memory Efficient Collaborative Edge AI Framework for Personal LLMs Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10746v1)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a plethora of powerful applications at the network edge, such as intelligent personal assistants. Data privacy and security concerns have prompted a shift towards edge-based fine-tuning of personal LLMs, away from cloud reliance. However, this raises issues of computational intensity and resource scarcity, hindering training efficiency and feasibility. While current studies investigate parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to mitigate resource constraints, our analysis indicates that these techniques are not sufficiently resource-efficient for edge devices. To tackle these challenges, we propose Pluto and Charon (PAC), a time and memory efficient collaborative edge AI framework for personal LLMs fine-tuning. PAC breaks the resource wall of personal LLMs fine-tuning with a sophisticated algorithm-system co-design. (1) Algorithmically, PAC implements a personal LLMs fine-tuning technique that is efficient in terms of parameters, time, and memory. It utilizes Parallel Adapters to circumvent the need for a full backward pass through the LLM backbone. Additionally, an activation cache mechanism further streamlining the process by negating the necessity for repeated forward passes across multiple epochs. (2) Systematically, PAC leverages edge devices in close proximity, pooling them as a collective resource for in-situ personal LLMs fine-tuning, utilizing a hybrid data and pipeline parallelism to orchestrate distributed training. The use of the activation cache eliminates the need for forward pass through the LLM backbone,enabling exclusive fine-tuning of the Parallel Adapters using data parallelism. Extensive evaluation based on prototype implementation demonstrates that PAC remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to 8.64x end-to-end speedup and up to 88.16% reduction in memory footprint.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The 53rd International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP'24)</p></details> |

A common approach to address motion planning problems is trajectory optimization. Trajectory optimization can represent the high-level behaviors of robots through mathematical formulations. However, current trajectory optimization approaches have two main challenges. Firstly, their solution heavily depends on the initial guess, and they are prone to get stuck in local minima. Secondly, they face scalability limitations by increasing the number of constraints. This thesis endeavors to tackle these challenges by introducing four innovative trajectory optimization algorithms to improve reliability, scalability, and computational efficiency. There are two novel aspects of the proposed algorithms. The first key innovation is remodeling the kinematic constraints and collision avoidance constraints. Another key innovation lies in the design of algorithms that effectively utilize parallel computation on GPU accelerators. By using reformulated constraints and leveraging the computational power of GPUs, the proposed algorithms of this thesis demonstrate significant improvements in efficiency and scalability compared to the existing methods. Parallelization enables faster computation times, allowing for real-time decision-making in dynamic environments. Moreover, the algorithms are designed to adapt to changes in the environment, ensuring robust performance. Extensive benchmarking for each proposed optimizer validates their efficacy. Overall, this thesis makes a significant contribution to the field of trajectory optimization algorithms. It introduces innovative solutions that specifically address the challenges faced by existing methods. The proposed algorithms pave the way for more efficient and robust motion planning solutions in robotics by leveraging parallel computation and specific mathematical structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD T...</summary><p>PhD Thesis, University of Tartu, 2024.

Our approach aims to enhance the transparency and understanding of deep learning models' decision processes. The application simplifies the time series data analysis by enabling users to interactively manipulate projected data points, providing intuitive insights through inverse projection techniques. By abstracting user interactions with the projected data points rather than the raw time series data, our method facilitates an intuitive generation of counterfactual explanations. This approach allows for a more straightforward exploration of univariate time series data, enabling users to manipulate data points to comprehend potential outcomes of hypothetical scenarios. We validate this method using the ECG5000 benchmark dataset, demonstrating significant improvements in interpretability and user understanding of time series classification. The results indicate a promising direction for enhancing explainable AI, with potential applications in various domains requiring transparent and interpretable deep learning models.

In this paper, we introduce Sequence Dreaming, a technique that adapts Activation Maximization to analyze sequential information, aiming to enhance the interpretability of neural networks operating on univariate time series. By leveraging this method, we visualize the temporal dynamics and patterns most influential in model decision-making processes. To counteract the generation of unrealistic or excessively noisy sequences, we enhance Sequence Dreaming with a range of regularization techniques, including exponential smoothing. This approach ensures the production of sequences that more accurately reflect the critical features identified by the neural network. Our approach is tested on a time series classification dataset encompassing applications in predictive maintenance. The results show that our proposed Sequence Dreaming approach demonstrates targeted activation maximization for different use cases so that either centered class or border activation maximization can be generated. The results underscore the versatility of Sequence Dreaming in uncovering salient temporal features learned by neural networks, thereby advancing model transparency and trustworthiness in decision-critical domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4 figures, accepted at TempXAI @ ECML-PKDD</p></details> |

However, one major setback [2] of nearly all nutrition applications is that users must enter food data manually, which is time-consuming and tedious. Thus, there has been an increasing demand for applications that can accurately identify food items, analyze their nutritional content, and offer dietary recommendations in real-time. This paper introduces a comprehensive system that combines advanced computer vision techniques with nutrition analysis, implemented in a versatile mobile and web application. The system is divided into three key components: 1) food detection using the YOLOv8 model, 2) nutrient analysis via the Edamam Nutrition Analysis API, and 3) personalized meal recommendations using the Edamam Meal Planning and Recipe Search APIs. Designed for both mobile and web platforms, the application ensures fast processing times with an intuitive user interface, with features such as data visualizations using Chart.js, a login system, and personalized settings for dietary preferences, allergies, and cuisine choices. Preliminary results showcase the system's effectiveness, making it a valuable tool for users to make informed dietary decisions.</p></details> | 7 pages, 12 figures |

By incorporating the backward differentiation formulae (BDF) for time discretization into the BGN formulation, originally proposed by Barrett, Garcke, and N\"urnberg (J. Comput.

The proposed BGN/BDF$k$ schemes not only retain almost all the advantages of the classical first-order BGN scheme such as computational efficiency and good mesh quality, but also exhibit the desired $k$th-order temporal accuracy in terms of shape metrics, ranging from second-order to fourth-order accuracy. Furthermore, we validate the performance of our proposed BGN/BDF$k$ schemes through extensive numerical examples, demonstrating their high-order temporal accuracy for various types of geometric flows while maintaining good mesh quality throughout the evolution.</p></details> |  |

Traditional models struggle to capture complex patterns due to these issues, compounded by limitations in computational resources and model capacity. Inspired by the success of large language models in NLP, we introduce $\textbf{PLUTUS}$, a $\textbf{P}$re-trained $\textbf{L}$arge $\textbf{U}$nified $\textbf{T}$ransformer-based model that $\textbf{U}$nveils regularities in financial time $\textbf{S}$eries. PLUTUS uses an invertible embedding module with contrastive learning and autoencoder techniques to create an approximate one-to-one mapping between raw data and patch embeddings. TimeFormer, an attention based architecture, forms the core of PLUTUS, effectively modeling high-noise time series. We incorporate a novel attention mechanisms to capture features across both variable and temporal dimensions. PLUTUS is pre-trained on an unprecedented dataset of 100 billion observations, designed to thrive in noisy financial environments. To our knowledge, PLUTUS is the first open-source, large-scale, pre-trained financial time series model with over one billion parameters. It achieves state-of-the-art performance in various tasks, demonstrating strong transferability and establishing a robust foundational model for finance. Our research provides technical guidance for pre-training financial time series data, setting a new standard in the field.</p></details> |  |

| **[PRformer: Pyramidal Recurrent Transformer for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10483v1)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The self-attention mechanism in Transformer architecture, invariant to sequence order, necessitates positional embeddings to encode temporal order in time series prediction. We argue that this reliance on positional embeddings restricts the Transformer's ability to effectively represent temporal sequences, particularly when employing longer lookback windows. To address this, we introduce an innovative approach that combines Pyramid RNN embeddings(PRE) for univariate time series with the Transformer's capability to model multivariate dependencies. PRE, utilizing pyramidal one-dimensional convolutional layers, constructs multiscale convolutional features that preserve temporal order. Additionally, RNNs, layered atop these features, learn multiscale time series representations sensitive to sequence order. This integration into Transformer models with attention mechanisms results in significant performance enhancements. We present the PRformer, a model integrating PRE with a standard Transformer encoder, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on various real-world datasets. This performance highlights the effectiveness of our approach in leveraging longer lookback windows and underscores the critical role of robust temporal representations in maximizing Transformer's potential for prediction tasks.

Soil moisture measurement technique of the proposed sensor is based on the complex permittivity sensing property of a DPS in time domain. Soil relative permittivity which varies with its moisture content is measured by burying the DPS under a soil mass and changing its phase difference while excited with a 114 MHz sine wave (single tone). DPS output phase and magnitude are compared with the reference signal and measured with a phase/loss detector. The proposed sensor exhibits accuracy better than +-1.2 percent at the highest Volumetric Water Content (VWC=30 percent) for sandy-type soil. Precise design guide is developed and simulations are performed to achieve a highly sensitive sensor. The measurement results validate the accuracy of theoretical analysis and design procedure. Owning the advantages of low profile, low power consumption, and high sensitivity makes the proposed TDT-SMS a good candidate for precision farming and IoT systems.</p></details> |  |

This has caused state-of-the-art DT applications to be validated using offline data. However, this approach falls short of integrating real-time data, which is one of the most important characteristics of DTs. This can limit the validating effectiveness of DT applications in cases such as aeronautical ad-hoc networks (AANETs). Considering this, we develop a Real-Time Digital Twin Platform and implement core network selection in AANETs as a case study. In this, we implement microservice-based architecture and design a robust data pipeline. Additionally, we develop an interactive user interface using open-source tools. Using this, the platform supports real-time decision-making in the presence of data retrieval failures.</p></details> |  |

More specifically, we first prove an FTISS Lyapunov theorem for a class of infinite-dimensional systems, namely, the existence of an FTISS Lyapunov functional (FTISS-LF) implies the FTISS of the system, and then, provide a sufficient condition for ensuring the existence of an FTISS-LF for a class of abstract infinite-dimensional systems under the framework of compact semigroup theory and Hilbert spaces. As an application of the FTISS Lyapunov theorem, we verify the FTISS for a class of parabolic PDEs involving sublinear terms and distributed in-domain disturbances. Since the nonlinear terms of the corresponding abstract system are not Lipschitz continuous, the well-posedness is proved based on the application of compact semigroup theory and the FTISS is assessed by using the Lyapunov method with the aid of an interpolation inequality. Numerical simulations are conducted to confirm the theoretical results.</p></details> |  |

This framework leverages deep learning methodologies, including conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons and the newly developed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. It is optimized using economic information encapsulated by Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations and coupled algebraic equations. The application of neural networks holds the promise of accurately resolving high-dimensional problems with fewer computational demands and limitations compared to standard numerical methods. This versatile framework can be readily adapted for elementary differential equations, and systems of differential equations, even in cases where the solutions may exhibit discontinuities. Importantly, it offers a more straightforward and user-friendly implementation than existing libraries.</p></details> | 25 pages, 8 figures |

Most existing methods focus on handling ISTS by converting irregularly sampled data into regularly sampled data via imputation. These models assume an underlying missing mechanism, which may lead to unwanted bias and sub-optimal performance. We present SLAN (Switch LSTM Aggregate Network), which utilizes a group of LSTMs to model ISTS without imputation, eliminating the assumption of any underlying process. It dynamically adapts its architecture on the fly based on the measured sensors using switches. SLAN exploits the irregularity information to explicitly capture each sensor's local summary and maintains a global summary state throughout the observational period. We demonstrate the efficacy of SLAN on two public datasets, namely, MIMIC-III, and Physionet 2012.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reliable Generation of Privacy-preserving Synthetic EHR Time Series via Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15290v4)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are rich sources of patient-level data, offering valuable resources for medical data analysis. However, privacy concerns often restrict access to EHRs, hindering downstream analysis. Current EHR de-identification methods are flawed and can lead to potential privacy leakage. Additionally, existing publicly available EHR databases are limited, preventing the advancement of medical research using EHR. This study aims to overcome these challenges by generating realistic and privacy-preserving synthetic electronic health records (EHRs) time series efficiently. We introduce a new method for generating diverse and realistic synthetic EHR time series data using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM). We conducted experiments on six databases: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III and IV (MIMIC-III/IV), the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU), and non-EHR datasets on Stocks and Energy. We compared our proposed method with eight existing methods. Our results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms all existing methods in terms of data fidelity while requiring less training effort. Additionally, data generated by our method yields a lower discriminative accuracy compared to other baseline methods, indicating the proposed method can generate data with less privacy risk. The proposed diffusion-model-based method can reliably and efficiently generate synthetic EHR time series, which facilitates the downstream medical data analysis. Our numerical results show the superiority of the proposed method over all other existing methods.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance significantly degrades when test inputs exhibit different distributions. In this paper, we explore the concept of test-time prompt tuning (TTPT), which facilitates the adaptation of the CLIP model to novel downstream tasks through a one-step unsupervised optimization that involves only test samples. Inspired by in-context learning in natural language processing (NLP), we propose In-Context Prompt Learning (InCPL) for test-time visual recognition tasks, which empowers a pre-trained vision-language model with labeled examples as context information on downstream task. Specifically, InCPL associates a new test sample with very few labeled examples (sometimes just one) as context information, enabling reliable label estimation for the test sample and facilitating model adaptation. To achieve this, InCPL employs an efficient language-to-vision translator to explore the textual prior information for visual prompt learning. Further, we introduce a context-aware unsupervised loss to optimize visual prompts tailored to test samples. Finally, we design a cyclic learning strategy for visual and textual prompts to ensure mutual synergy across different modalities. This enables a pre-trained, frozen CLIP model to adapt to any task using its learned adaptive prompt. Our method demonstrates superior performance and achieves state-of-the-art results across various downstream datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking the Power of LSTM for Long Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10006v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional recurrent neural network architectures, such as long short-term memory neural networks (LSTM), have historically held a prominent role in time series forecasting (TSF) tasks. While the recently introduced sLSTM for Natural Language Processing (NLP) introduces exponential gating and memory mixing that are beneficial for long term sequential learning, its potential short memory issue is a barrier to applying sLSTM directly in TSF. To address this, we propose a simple yet efficient algorithm named P-sLSTM, which is built upon sLSTM by incorporating patching and channel independence. These modifications substantially enhance sLSTM's performance in TSF, achieving state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, we provide theoretical justifications for our design, and conduct extensive comparative and analytical experiments to fully validate the efficiency and superior performance of our model.</p></details> |  |

The higher capacity, long-range and robustness to Doppler effect make LR-FHSS a primary candidate for direct-to-satellite (DtS) connectivity for enabling Internet-of-things (IoT) in remote areas. The LR-FHSS devices envisioned for DtS IoT will be primarily battery-powered. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the current consumption characteristics and Time-on-Air (ToA) of LR-FHSS technology. However, to our knowledge, no prior research has presented the accurate ToA and current consumption models for this newly introduced scheme. This paper addresses this shortcoming through extensive field measurements and the development of analytical models. Specifically, we have measured the current consumption and ToA for variable transmit power, message payload, and two new LR-FHSS-based Data Rates (DR8 and DR9). We also develop current consumption and ToA analytical models demonstrating a strong correlation with the measurement results exhibiting a relative error of less than 0.3%. Thus, it confirms the validity of our models. Conversely, the existing analytical models exhibit a higher relative error rate of -9.2 to 3.4% compared to our measurement results. The presented in this paper results can be further used for simulators or in analytical studies to accurately model the on-air time and energy consumption of LR-FHSS devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE Internet of Things Journal for possible publication.

| **[Detecting Wildfires on UAVs with Real-time Segmentation Trained by Larger Teacher Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10843v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early detection of wildfires is essential to prevent large-scale fires resulting in extensive environmental, structural, and societal damage. Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) can cover large remote areas effectively with quick deployment requiring minimal infrastructure and equipping them with small cameras and computers enables autonomous real-time detection. In remote areas, however, the UAVs are limited to on-board computing for detection due to the lack of high-bandwidth mobile networks. This limits the detection to methods which are light enough for the on-board computer alone. For accurate camera-based localisation, segmentation of the detected smoke is essential but training data for deep learning-based wildfire smoke segmentation is limited. This study shows how small specialised segmentation models can be trained using only bounding box labels, leveraging zero-shot foundation model supervision. The method offers the advantages of needing only fairly easily obtainable bounding box labels and requiring training solely for the smaller student network. The proposed method achieved 63.3% mIoU on a manually annotated and diverse wildfire dataset. The used model can perform in real-time at ~11 fps with a UAV-carried NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX computer while reliably recognising smoke, demonstrated at real-world forest burning events. Code is available at https://gitlab.com/fgi_nls/public/wildfire-real-time-segmentation</p></details> |  |
| **[Space-time Trade-offs for the LCP Array of Wheeler DFAs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05684v2)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Conte et al. generalized the longest-common prefix (LCP) array from strings to Wheeler DFAs, and they showed that it can be used to efficiently determine matching statistics on a Wheeler DFA [DCC 2023]. However, storing the LCP array requires $ O(n \log n) $ bits, $ n $ being the number of states, while the compact representation of Wheeler DFAs often requires much less space. In particular, the BOSS representation of a de Bruijn graph only requires a linear number of bits, if the size of alphabet is constant. In this paper, we propose a sampling technique that allows to access an entry of the LCP array in logarithmic time by only storing a linear number of bits. We use our technique to provide a space-time trade-off to compute matching statistics on a Wheeler DFA. In addition, we show that by augmenting the BOSS representation of a $ k $-th order de Bruijn graph with a linear number of bits we can navigate the underlying variable-order de Bruijn graph in time logarithmic in $ k $, thus improving a previous bound by Boucher et al. which was linear in $ k $ [DCC 2015].</p></details> |  |
| **[Parallel-in-Time Solutions with Random Projection Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09756v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers one of the fundamental parallel-in-time methods for the solution of ordinary differential equations, Parareal, and extends it by adopting a neural network as a coarse propagator. We provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm and show its effectiveness for several examples, including Lorenz and Burgers' equations. In our numerical simulations, we further specialize the underpinning neural architecture to Random Projection Neural Networks (RPNNs), a 2-layer neural network where the first layer weights are drawn at random rather than optimized. This restriction substantially increases the efficiency of fitting RPNN's weights in comparison to a standard feedforward network without negatively impacting the accuracy, as demonstrated in the SIR system example.</p></details> |  |
| **[RealCustom++: Representing Images as Real-Word for Real-Time Customization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09744v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image customization, which takes given texts and images depicting given subjects as inputs, aims to synthesize new images that align with both text semantics and subject appearance. This task provides precise control over details that text alone cannot capture and is fundamental for various real-world applications, garnering significant interest from academia and industry. Existing works follow the pseudo-word paradigm, which involves representing given subjects as pseudo-words and combining them with given texts to collectively guide the generation. However, the inherent conflict and entanglement between the pseudo-words and texts result in a dual-optimum paradox, where subject similarity and text controllability cannot be optimal simultaneously. We propose a novel real-words paradigm termed RealCustom++ that instead represents subjects as non-conflict real words, thereby disentangling subject similarity from text controllability and allowing both to be optimized simultaneously. Specifically, RealCustom++ introduces a novel "train-inference" decoupled framework: (1) During training, RealCustom++ learns the alignment between vision conditions and all real words in the text, ensuring high subject-similarity generation in open domains. This is achieved by the cross-layer cross-scale projector to robustly and finely extract subject features, and a curriculum training recipe that adapts the generated subject to diverse poses and sizes. (2) During inference, leveraging the learned general alignment, an adaptive mask guidance is proposed to only customize the generation of the specific target real word, keeping other subject-irrelevant regions uncontaminated to ensure high text-controllability in real-time.</p></details> | 23 pages |
| **[sTransformer: A Modular Approach for Extracting Inter-Sequential and Temporal Information for Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09723v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, numerous Transformer-based models have been applied to long-term time-series forecasting (LTSF) tasks. However, recent studies with linear models have questioned their effectiveness, demonstrating that simple linear layers can outperform sophisticated Transformer-based models. In this work, we review and categorize existing Transformer-based models into two main types: (1) modifications to the model structure and (2) modifications to the input data. The former offers scalability but falls short in capturing inter-sequential information, while the latter preprocesses time-series data but is challenging to use as a scalable module. We propose $\textbf{sTransformer}$, which introduces the Sequence and Temporal Convolutional Network (STCN) to fully capture both sequential and temporal information. Additionally, we introduce a Sequence-guided Mask Attention mechanism to capture global feature information. Our approach ensures the capture of inter-sequential information while maintaining module scalability. We compare our model with linear models and existing forecasting models on long-term time-series forecasting, achieving new state-of-the-art results. We also conducted experiments on other time-series tasks, achieving strong performance. These demonstrate that Transformer-based structures remain effective and our model can serve as a viable baseline for time-series tasks.</p></details> |  |

This paper aims to design an easy-to-use pipeline (termed as EasyDGL which is also due to its implementation by DGL toolkit) composed of three key modules with both strong fitting ability and interpretability. Specifically the proposed pipeline which involves encoding, training and interpreting: i) a temporal point process (TPP) modulated attention architecture to endow the continuous-time resolution with the coupled spatiotemporal dynamics of the observed graph with edge-addition events; ii) a principled loss composed of task-agnostic TPP posterior maximization based on observed events on the graph, and a task-aware loss with a masking strategy over dynamic graph, where the covered tasks include dynamic link prediction, dynamic node classification and node traffic forecasting; iii) interpretation of the model outputs (e.g., representations and predictions) with scalable perturbation-based quantitative analysis in the graph Fourier domain, which could more comprehensively reflect the behavior of the learned model. Extensive experimental results on public benchmarks show the superior performance of our EasyDGL for time-conditioned predictive tasks, and in particular demonstrate that EasyDGL can effectively quantify the predictive power of frequency content that a model learn from the evolving graph data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence</p></details> |

Machine learning (ML) techniques have been emerging in diagnosing motor conditions using only motor phase current signals. This study converts time-series motor current signals to time-frequency 2D plots using Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) methods. The motor current signal dataset consists of 3,750 sample points with five classes - one healthy and four synthetically-applied motor fault conditions, and with five loading conditions: 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100%. Five transformation methods are used on the dataset: non-overlap and overlap STFTs, non-overlap and overlap realigned STFTs, and synchrosqueezed STFT. Then, deep learning (DL) models based on the previous Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture are trained and validated from generated plots of each method. The DL models of overlap-STFT, overlap R-STFT, non-overlap STFT, non-overlap R-STFT, and synchrosqueezed-STFT performed exceptionally with an average accuracy of 97.65, 96.03, 96.08, 96.32, and 88.27%, respectively. Four methods outperformed the previous best ML method with 93.20% accuracy, while all five outperformed previous 2D-plot-based methods with accuracy of 80.25, 74.80, and 82.80%, respectively, using the same dataset, same DL architecture, and validation steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 6 images, submitted to 2024 International Conference on Diagnostics in Electrical Engineering (Diagnostika)</p></details> |

When the underlying dynamics remain unknown and we have access only to discrete-time information, how can we effectively conduct policy evaluation? We first highlight that the commonly used Bellman equation (BE) is not always a reliable approximation to the true value function. We then introduce a new bellman equation, PhiBE, which integrates the discrete-time information into a PDE formulation. The new bellman equation offers a more accurate approximation to the true value function, especially in scenarios where the underlying dynamics change slowly. Moreover, we extend PhiBE to higher orders, providing increasingly accurate approximations. We conduct the error analysis for both BE and PhiBE with explicit dependence on the discounted coefficient, the reward and the dynamics. Additionally, we present a model-free algorithm to solve PhiBE when only discrete-time trajectory data is available. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the theoretical guarantees we propose.</p></details> |  |

Despite their theoretical appeal, KAN require validation on large-scale benchmark datasets. Time series data, which has become increasingly prevalent in recent years, especially univariate time series are naturally suited for validating KAN. Therefore, we conducted a fair comparison among KAN, MLP, and mixed structures. The results indicate that KAN can achieve performance comparable to, or even slightly better than, MLP across 128 time series datasets. We also performed an ablation study on KAN, revealing that the output is primarily determined by the base component instead of b-spline function. Furthermore, we assessed the robustness of these models and found that KAN and the hybrid structure MLP\_KAN exhibit significant robustness advantages, attributed to their lower Lipschitz constants. This suggests that KAN and KAN layers hold strong potential to be robust models or to improve the adversarial robustness of other models.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figs |

By reformulating the DCMRAP as a single-objective weighted $L_p$ problem, a distributed solution is enabled, which eliminates the need for predetermined weighting factors or centralized decision-making in traditional methods. Leveraging prescribed-time control and dynamic event-triggered mechanisms (ETMs), novel distributed algorithms are proposed to achieve Pareto optimality within a prescribed settling time through sampled communication. Using generalized time-based generators (TBGs), these algorithms provide more flexibility in optimizing accuracy and control smoothness without the constraints of initial conditions. Novel dynamic ETMs are designed to work with generalized TBGs to promote communication efficiency, which adjusts to both local error metrics and network-based disagreements. The Zeno behavior is excluded. Validated by Lyapunov analysis and simulations, our method demonstrates superior control performance and efficiency compared to existing methods, advancing distributed optimization in complex environments.</p></details> |  |

Thus, large amounts of video samples are continuously required for traditional data-driven training. However, samples are not always sufficient in real-world scenarios, promoting few-shot action recognition (FSAR) research. We observe that most recent FSAR works build spatio-temporal relation of video samples via temporal alignment after spatial feature extraction, cutting apart spatial and temporal features within samples. They also capture motion information via narrow perspectives between adjacent frames without considering density, leading to insufficient motion information capturing. Therefore, we propose a novel plug-and-play architecture for FSAR called Spatio-tempOral frAme tuPle enhancer (SOAP) in this paper. The model we designed with such architecture refers to SOAP-Net. Temporal connections between different feature channels and spatio-temporal relation of features are considered instead of simple feature extraction. Comprehensive motion information is also captured, using frame tuples with multiple frames containing more motion information than adjacent frames. Combining frame tuples of diverse frame counts further provides a broader perspective. SOAP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance across well-known benchmarks such as SthSthV2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51. Extensive empirical evaluations underscore the competitiveness, pluggability, generalization, and robustness of SOAP.

By fine-tuning multimodal LLMs with temporal annotations from well-annotated datasets, e.g., dense video captioning datasets, their temporal understanding capacity in video-language tasks can be obtained. However, there is a notable lack of untrimmed audio-visual video datasets with precise temporal annotations for events. This deficiency hinders LLMs from learning the alignment between time, audio-visual events, and text tokens, thus impairing their ability to temporally localize audio-visual events in videos. To address this gap, we introduce PU-VALOR, a comprehensive audio-visual dataset comprising over 114,000 pseudo-untrimmed videos with detailed temporal annotations. PU-VALOR is derived from the large-scale but coarse-annotated audio-visual dataset VALOR, through a subtle method involving event-based video clustering, random temporal scaling, and permutation. By fine-tuning a multimodal LLM on PU-VALOR, we developed AVicuna, a model capable of aligning audio-visual events with temporal intervals and corresponding text tokens. AVicuna excels in temporal localization and time-aware dialogue capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that AVicuna effectively handles temporal understanding in audio-visual videos and achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-ended video QA, audio-visual QA, and audio-visual event dense localization tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[V2Xum-LLM: Cross-Modal Video Summarization with Temporal Prompt Instruction Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12353v2)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video summarization aims to create short, accurate, and cohesive summaries of longer videos. Despite the existence of various video summarization datasets, a notable limitation is their limited amount of source videos, which hampers the effective training of advanced large vision-language models (VLMs). Additionally, most existing datasets are created for video-to-video summarization, overlooking the contemporary need for multimodal video content summarization. Recent efforts have been made to expand from unimodal to multimodal video summarization, categorizing the task into three sub-tasks based on the summary's modality: video-to-video (V2V), video-to-text (V2T), and a combination of video and text summarization (V2VT). However, the textual summaries in previous multimodal datasets are inadequate. To address these issues, we introduce Instruct-V2Xum, a cross-modal video summarization dataset featuring 30,000 diverse videos sourced from YouTube, with lengths ranging from 40 to 940 seconds and an average summarization ratio of 16.39%. Each video summary in Instruct-V2Xum is paired with a textual summary that references specific frame indexes, facilitating the generation of aligned video and textual summaries. In addition, we propose a new video summarization framework named V2Xum-LLM. V2Xum-LLM, specifically V2Xum-LLaMA in this study, is the first framework that unifies different video summarization tasks into one large language model's (LLM) text decoder and achieves task-controllable video summarization with temporal prompts and task instructions. Experiments show that V2Xum-LLaMA outperforms strong baseline models on multiple video summarization tasks. Furthermore, we propose an enhanced evaluation metric for V2V and V2VT summarization tasks.</p></details> |  |

Through activity-driven temporal networks, we formulate a general framework which models a wide range of adaptive behaviours and mitigation strategies, observed in real populations. We analytically derive the conditions for a widespread diffusion of epidemics in the presence of arbitrary adaptive behaviours, highlighting the crucial role of correlations between agents behaviour in the infected and in the susceptible state. We focus on the effects of sick-leave, comparing the effectiveness of different strategies in reducing the impact of the epidemic and preserving the system operativeness. We show the critical relevance of heterogeneity in individual behavior: in homogeneous networks, all sick-leave strategies are equivalent and poorly effective, while in heterogeneous networks, strategies targeting the most vulnerable nodes are able to effectively mitigate the epidemic, also avoiding a deterioration in system activity and maintaining a low level of absenteeism. Interestingly, with targeted strategies both the minimum of population activity and the maximum of absenteeism anticipate the infection peak, which is effectively flattened and delayed, so that full operativeness is almost restored when the infection peak arrives. We also provide realistic estimates of the model parameters for influenza-like illness, thereby suggesting strategies for managing epidemics and absenteeism in realistic populations.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |

Although various neural networks with intricate architectures have been developed to address this problem, they still face two key challenges: i) Recent advancements in network designs for modeling spatio-temporal correlations are starting to see diminishing returns in performance enhancements. ii) Additionally, most models do not account for the spatio-temporal heterogeneity inherent in traffic data, i.e., traffic distribution varies significantly across different regions and traffic flow patterns fluctuate across various time slots. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer (STGormer), which effectively integrates attribute and structure information inherent in traffic data for learning spatio-temporal correlations, and a mixture-of-experts module for capturing heterogeneity along spaital and temporal axes. Specifically, we design two straightforward yet effective spatial encoding methods based on the graph structure and integrate time position encoding into the vanilla transformer to capture spatio-temporal traffic patterns. Additionally, a mixture-of-experts enhanced feedforward neural network (FNN) module adaptively assigns suitable expert layers to distinct patterns via a spatio-temporal gating network, further improving overall prediction accuracy. Experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that STGormer achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploiting Large Language Models Capabilities for Question Answer-Driven Knowledge Graph Completion Across Static and Temporal Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10819v1)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to identify missing triples in a knowledge graph (KG). This is typically achieved through tasks such as link prediction and instance completion. However, these methods often focus on either static knowledge graphs (SKGs) or temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs), addressing only within-scope triples. This paper introduces a new generative completion framework called Generative Subgraph-based KGC (GS-KGC). GS-KGC employs a question-answering format to directly generate target entities, addressing the challenge of questions having multiple possible answers. We propose a strategy that extracts subgraphs centered on entities and relationships within the KG, from which negative samples and neighborhood information are separately obtained to address the one-to-many problem. Our method generates negative samples using known facts to facilitate the discovery of new information. Furthermore, we collect and refine neighborhood path data of known entities, providing contextual information to enhance reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Our experiments evaluated the proposed method on four SKGs and two TKGs, achieving state-of-the-art Hits@1 metrics on five datasets. Analysis of the results shows that GS-KGC can discover new triples within existing KGs and generate new facts beyond the closed KG, effectively bridging the gap between closed-world and open-world KGC.</p></details> |  |
| **[TDS-CLIP: Temporal Difference Side Network for Image-to-Video Transfer Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10688v1)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large-scale pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP), have garnered significant attention thanks to their powerful representative capabilities. This inspires researchers in transferring the knowledge from these large pre-trained models to other task-specific models, e.g., Video Action Recognition (VAR) models, via particularly leveraging side networks to enhance the efficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). However, current transferring approaches in VAR tend to directly transfer the frozen knowledge from large pre-trained models to action recognition networks with minimal cost, instead of exploiting the temporal modeling capabilities of the action recognition models themselves. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a memory-efficient Temporal Difference Side Network (TDS-CLIP) to balance knowledge transferring and temporal modeling, avoiding backpropagation in frozen parameter models. Specifically, we introduce a Temporal Difference Adapter (TD-Adapter), which can effectively capture local temporal differences in motion features to strengthen the model's global temporal modeling capabilities. Furthermore, we designed a Side Motion Enhancement Adapter (SME-Adapter) to guide the proposed side network in efficiently learning the rich motion information in videos, thereby improving the side network's ability to capture and learn motion information. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets, including Something-Something V1\&V2, and Kinetics-400. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance.</p></details> |  |

The color, shape, and location of moire patterns may differ across video frames, posing a challenge in learning information from adjacent frames and preserving temporal consistency. Previous video demoireing methods heavily rely on well-designed alignment modules, resulting in substantial computational burdens. Recently, Mamba, an improved version of the State Space Model (SSM), has demonstrated significant potential for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, enabling efficient temporal modeling in video demoireing without requiring a specific alignment module. In this paper, we propose a novel alignment-free Raw video demoireing network with frequency-assisted spatio-temporal Mamba (DemMamba). The Spatial Mamba Block (SMB) and Temporal Mamba Block (TMB) are sequentially arranged to facilitate effective intra- and inter-relationship modeling in Raw videos with moire patterns. Within SMB, an Adaptive Frequency Block (AFB) is introduced to aid demoireing in the frequency domain. For TMB, a Channel Attention Block (CAB) is embedded to further enhance temporal information interactions by exploiting the inter-channel relationships among features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DemMamba surpasses state-of-the-art approaches by 1.3 dB and delivers a superior visual experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[Target-Prompt Online Graph Collaborative Learning for Temporal QoS Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10555v1)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In service-oriented architecture, accurately predicting the Quality of Service (QoS) is vital for maintaining reliability and enhancing user satisfaction. However, current methods often neglect high-order latent collaborative relationships and fail to dynamically adjust feature learning for specific user-service invocations, which are critical for precise feature extraction. Moreover, relying on RNNs to capture QoS evolution limits the ability to detect long-term trends due to challenges in managing long-range dependencies. To address these issues, we propose the Target-Prompt Online Graph Collaborative Learning (TOGCL) framework for temporal QoS prediction. It leverages a dynamic user-service invocation graph to comprehensively model historical interactions. Building on this graph, it develops a target-prompt graph attention network to extract online deep latent features of users and services at each time slice, considering implicit target-neighboring collaborative relationships and historical QoS values. Additionally, a multi-layer Transformer encoder is employed to uncover temporal feature evolution patterns, enhancing temporal QoS prediction. Extensive experiments on the WS-DREAM dataset demonstrate that TOGCL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics, achieving improvements of up to 38.80\%. These results underscore the effectiveness of TOGCL for temporal QoS prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

Integrating both infrastructure and ego-vehicle data through V2X communication, known as vehicle-infrastructure cooperation, has shown considerable advantages in enhancing perception capabilities and addressing corner cases encountered in single-vehicle autonomous driving. However, cooperative perception still faces numerous challenges, including limited communication bandwidth and practical communication interruptions. In this paper, we propose CTCE, a novel framework for cooperative 3D object detection. This framework transmits queries with temporal contexts enhancement, effectively balancing transmission efficiency and performance to accommodate real-world communication conditions. Additionally, we propose a temporal-guided fusion module to further improve performance. The roadside temporal enhancement and vehicle-side spatial-temporal fusion together constitute a multi-level temporal contexts integration mechanism, fully leveraging temporal information to enhance performance. Furthermore, a motion-aware reconstruction module is introduced to recover lost roadside queries due to communication interruptions. Experimental results on V2X-Seq and V2X-Sim datasets demonstrate that CTCE outperforms the baseline QUEST, achieving improvements of 3.8% and 1.3% in mAP, respectively. Experiments under communication interruption conditions validate CTCE's robustness to communication interruptions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE ITSC 2024</p></details> |

Existing distortion correction solutions often struggle to balance computational complexity and accuracy. In this work, we propose an Adaptive Temporal Interval-based Continuous-Time LiDAR-only Odometry, utilizing straightforward and efficient linear interpolation. Our method flexibly adjusts the temporal intervals between control nodes according to the dynamics of motion and environmental characteristics. This adaptability enhances performance across various motion states and improves robustness in challenging, feature-sparse environments. We validate the effectiveness of our method on multiple datasets across different platforms, achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art LiDAR-only odometry methods. Notably, in scenarios involving aggressive motion and sparse features, our method outperforms existing solutions.</p></details> |  |

However, state-of-the-art temporal action segmentation methods overlook the long tail and fail to recognize tail actions. Existing long-tail methods make class-independent assumptions and struggle to identify tail classes when applied to temporal segmentation frameworks. This work proposes a novel group-wise temporal logit adjustment~(G-TLA) framework that combines a group-wise softmax formulation while leveraging activity information and action ordering for logit adjustment. The proposed framework significantly improves in segmenting tail actions without any performance loss on head actions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024</p></details> |

We divide temporal message passing mechanisms from literature into two main types: global and local, and establish Weisfeiler-Leman characterisations for both. This allows us to formally analyse expressive power of temporal message-passing models. We show that global and local temporal message-passing mechanisms have incomparable expressive power when applied to arbitrary temporal graphs. However, the local mechanism is strictly more expressive than the global mechanism when applied to colour-persistent temporal graphs, whose node colours are initially the same in all time points. Our theoretical findings are supported by experimental evidence, underlining practical implications of our analysis.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[sTransformer: A Modular Approach for Extracting Inter-Sequential and Temporal Information for Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09723v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, numerous Transformer-based models have been applied to long-term time-series forecasting (LTSF) tasks. However, recent studies with linear models have questioned their effectiveness, demonstrating that simple linear layers can outperform sophisticated Transformer-based models. In this work, we review and categorize existing Transformer-based models into two main types: (1) modifications to the model structure and (2) modifications to the input data. The former offers scalability but falls short in capturing inter-sequential information, while the latter preprocesses time-series data but is challenging to use as a scalable module. We propose $\textbf{sTransformer}$, which introduces the Sequence and Temporal Convolutional Network (STCN) to fully capture both sequential and temporal information. Additionally, we introduce a Sequence-guided Mask Attention mechanism to capture global feature information. Our approach ensures the capture of inter-sequential information while maintaining module scalability. We compare our model with linear models and existing forecasting models on long-term time-series forecasting, achieving new state-of-the-art results. We also conducted experiments on other time-series tasks, achieving strong performance. These demonstrate that Transformer-based structures remain effective and our model can serve as a viable baseline for time-series tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Timo: Towards Better Temporal Reasoning for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14192v2)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning about time is essential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand the world. Previous works focus on solving specific tasks, primarily on time-sensitive question answering. While these methods have proven effective, they cannot generalize to a wider spectrum of temporal reasoning tasks. Therefore, we propose a crucial question: Can we build a universal framework to handle a variety of temporal reasoning tasks? To that end, we systematically study 38 temporal reasoning tasks. Based on the observation that 19 tasks are directly related to mathematics, we first leverage the available mathematical dataset to set a solid foundation for temporal reasoning. However, the in-depth study indicates that focusing solely on mathematical enhancement falls short of addressing pure temporal reasoning tasks. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a simple but effective self-critic temporal optimization method to enhance the model's temporal reasoning capabilities without sacrificing general task abilities. Finally, we develop Timo, a model designed to excel in temporal reasoning at the 7B and 13B scales. Notably, Timo outperforms the counterpart LLMs by 10.0 and 7.6 in average accuracy scores and achieves the new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of comparable size. Extensive experiments further validate our framework's effectiveness and its generalization across diverse temporal tasks.

Despite recent advances with transformer-based forecasting models, challenges remain due to the non-stationary, nonlinear characteristics of workload time series and the long-term dependencies. In particular, inconsistent performance between long-term history and near-term forecasts hinders long-range predictions. This paper proposes a novel framework leveraging self-supervised multiscale representation learning to capture both long-term and near-term workload patterns. The long-term history is encoded through multiscale representations while the near-term observations are modeled via temporal flow fusion. These representations of different scales are fused using an attention mechanism and characterized with normalizing flows to handle non-Gaussian/non-linear distributions of time series. Extensive experiments on 9 benchmarks demonstrate superiority over existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 33rd ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM '24), October 21--25, 2024, Boise, ID, USA</p></details> |
| **[Evidence-Based Temporal Fact Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15291v2)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated fact verification plays an essential role in fostering trust in the digital space. Despite the growing interest, the verification of temporal facts has not received much attention in the community. Temporal fact verification brings new challenges where cues of the temporal information need to be extracted and temporal reasoning involving various temporal aspects of the text must be applied. In this work, we propose an end-to-end solution for temporal fact verification that considers the temporal information in claims to obtain relevant evidence sentences and harness the power of large language model for temporal reasoning. Recognizing that temporal facts often involve events, we model these events in the claim and evidence sentences. We curate two temporal fact datasets to learn time-sensitive representations that encapsulate not only the semantic relationships among the events, but also their chronological proximity. This allows us to retrieve the top-k relevant evidence sentences and provide the context for a large language model to perform temporal reasoning and outputs whether a claim is supported or refuted by the retrieved evidence sentences. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances the accuracy of temporal claim verification, thereby advancing current state-of-the-art in automated fact verification.</p></details> |  |

Traditional research has focused on deterministic rules governing pairwise interactions, yet the impact of interaction frequency and synchronization in groups on cooperation remains underexplored. Addressing this gap, our work introduces two temporal interaction mechanisms to model the stochastic or periodic participation of individuals in public goods games, acknowledging real-life variances due to exogenous temporal factors and geographical time differences. We consider that the interaction state significantly influences both game payoff calculations and the strategy updating process, offering new insights into the emergence and sustainability of cooperation. Our results indicate that maximum game participation frequency is suboptimal under a stochastic interaction mechanism. Instead, an intermediate activation probability maximizes cooperation, suggesting a vital balance between interaction frequency and inactivity security. Furthermore, local synchronization of interactions within specific areas is shown to be beneficial, as time differences hinder the spread of cross-structures but promote the formation of dense cooperative clusters with smoother boundaries. We also note that stronger clustering in networks, larger group sizes and lower noise increase cooperation. This research contributes to understanding the role of node-based temporality and probabilistic interactions in social dilemmas, offering insights into fostering cooperation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Physical Review E</p></details> |
| **[Directed Exploration in Reinforcement Learning from Linear Temporal Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09495v1)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear temporal logic (LTL) is a powerful language for task specification in reinforcement learning, as it allows describing objectives beyond the expressivity of conventional discounted return formulations. Nonetheless, recent works have shown that LTL formulas can be translated into a variable rewarding and discounting scheme, whose optimization produces a policy maximizing a lower bound on the probability of formula satisfaction. However, the synthesized reward signal remains fundamentally sparse, making exploration challenging. We aim to overcome this limitation, which can prevent current algorithms from scaling beyond low-dimensional, short-horizon problems. We show how better exploration can be achieved by further leveraging the LTL specification and casting its corresponding Limit Deterministic B\"uchi Automaton (LDBA) as a Markov reward process, thus enabling a form of high-level value estimation. By taking a Bayesian perspective over LDBA dynamics and proposing a suitable prior distribution, we show that the values estimated through this procedure can be treated as a shaping potential and mapped to informative intrinsic rewards. Empirically, we demonstrate applications of our method from tabular settings to high-dimensional continuous systems, which have so far represented a significant challenge for LTL-based reinforcement learning algorithms.</p></details> |  |

The agents need to resist the temptation of individual rewards through foraging and choose the collective long-term goal of sustainability. We investigate methods of online learning in Neuro-Evolution and Deep Recurrent Q-Networks to enable agents to attempt the problem one-shot as is often required by wicked social problems. We further explore if learning temporal dependencies with Long Short-Term Memory may be able to aid the agents in developing sustainable foraging strategies in the long term. It was found that the integration of Long Short-Term Memory assisted agents in developing sustainable strategies for a single agent, however failed to assist agents in managing the social dilemma that arises in the multi-agent scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication by the Second International Workshop on Sustainability and Scalability of Self-Organisation (SaSSO 2024), DOI to be provided once published</p></details> |

It is receiving renewed interest in the context of, among others, business process modelling that needs robust expressive data models to complement them. None of the proposed temporal conceptual data modelling languages have been tested on understandability and usability by modellers, however, nor is it clear which temporal constraints would be used by modellers or whether the ones included are the relevant temporal constraints. We therefore sought to investigate temporal representations in temporal conceptual data modelling languages, design a, to date, most expressive language, TREND, through small-scale qualitative experiments, and finalise the graphical notation and modelling and understanding in large scale experiments. This involved a series of 11 experiments with over a thousand participants in total, having created 246 temporal conceptual data models. Key outcomes are that choice of label for transition constraints had limited impact, as did extending explanations of the modelling language, but expressing what needs to be modelled in controlled natural language did improve model quality. The experiments also indicate that more training may be needed, in particular guidance for domain experts, to achieve adoption of temporal conceptual data modelling by the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 23 figures, 11 tables, submitted to an international journal</p></details> |

Hence, knowledge obtained from Wi-Fi network measurements can be helpful for a more efficient network management. In this paper, we propose a methodology to predict future values of some specific network metrics (e.g. traffic load, transmission failures, etc.). These predictions may be useful for improving the network performance. After data collection and preprocessing, the correlation between each target access point (AP) and its neighbouring APs is estimated. According to these correlations, either an only-temporal or a spatio-temporal based prediction is done. To evaluate the proposed methodology, real measurements are collected from 100 APs deployed in different university buildings for 3 months. Deep Learning (DL) methods (i.e. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Simple Recurrent Neural Network (SRNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Transformer) are evaluated and compared for both temporal and spatio-temporal based predictions. Moreover, a hybrid prediction methodology is proposed using a spatial processing based on CNN and a temporal prediction based on RNN. The proposed hybrid methodology provides an improvement in the prediction accuracy at expenses of a slight increase in the Training Computational Time (TCT) and negligible in Prediction Computational Time (PCT).</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

Conventional pooling methods overlook the preservation of motion information and treat each frame equally. However, in an action sequence, only a few segments of frames carry discriminative information related to the action. This paper presents a novel Joint Motion Adaptive Temporal Pooling (JMAP) method for improving skeleton-based action recognition. Two variants of JMAP, frame-wise pooling and joint-wise pooling, are introduced. The efficacy of JMAP has been validated through experiments on the popular NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD datasets.</p></details> |  |

Large temporal scale variation of actions is one of the most primary difficulties in TAD. Naturally, multi-scale features have potential in localizing actions of diverse lengths as widely used in object detection. Nevertheless, unlike objects in images, actions have more ambiguity in their boundaries. That is, small neighboring objects are not considered as a large one while short adjoining actions can be misunderstood as a long one. In the coarse-to-fine feature pyramid via pooling, these vague action boundaries can fade out, which we call 'vanishing boundary problem'. To this end, we propose Boundary-Recovering Network (BRN) to address the vanishing boundary problem. BRN constructs scale-time features by introducing a new axis called scale dimension by interpolating multi-scale features to the same temporal length. On top of scale-time features, scale-time blocks learn to exchange features across scale levels, which can effectively settle down the issue. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art on the two challenging benchmarks, ActivityNet-v1.3 and THUMOS14, with remarkably reduced degree of the vanishing boundary problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Pattern Recognition Journal</p></details> |

Its solutions hold significant implications across various domains (e.g., ride-hailing, insurance), wherein their application serves to safeguard users and mitigate potential fraudulent activities. Present HuMID solutions often exhibit limitations in adaptability when confronted with lengthy trajectories, consequently incurring substantial computational overhead. Furthermore, their inability to effectively extract crucial local information further impedes their performance. To address this problem, we propose a Siamese Multiple Attention Temporal Convolutional Network (Siamese MA-TCN) to capitalize on the strengths of both TCN architecture and multi-head self-attention, enabling the proficient extraction of both local and long-term dependencies. Additionally, we devise a novel attention mechanism tailored for the efficient aggregation of multi-scale representations derived from our model. Experimental evaluations conducted on two real-world taxi trajectory datasets reveal that our proposed model effectively extracts both local key information and long-term dependencies. These findings highlight the model's outstanding generalization capabilities, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability across datasets of varying sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>27th ...</summary><p>27th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC) (ITSC 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Linear Attention is Enough in Spatial-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09158v1)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the most representative scenario of spatial-temporal forecasting tasks, the traffic forecasting task attracted numerous attention from machine learning community due to its intricate correlation both in space and time dimension. Existing methods often treat road networks over time as spatial-temporal graphs, addressing spatial and temporal representations independently. However, these approaches struggle to capture the dynamic topology of road networks, encounter issues with message passing mechanisms and over-smoothing, and face challenges in learning spatial and temporal relationships separately. To address these limitations, we propose treating nodes in road networks at different time steps as independent spatial-temporal tokens and feeding them into a vanilla Transformer to learn complex spatial-temporal patterns, design STformer achieving SOTA. Given its quadratic complexity, we introduce a variant NSTformer based on Nystr$\ddot{o}$m method to approximate self-attention with linear complexity but even slightly better than former in a few cases astonishingly. Extensive experimental results on traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance at an affordable computational cost.

| **[Stock Recommendations for Individual Investors: A Temporal Graph Network Approach with Mean-Variance Efficient Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07223v2)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems can be helpful for individuals to make well-informed decisions in complex financial markets. While many studies have focused on predicting stock prices, even advanced models fall short of accurately forecasting them. Additionally, previous studies indicate that individual investors often disregard established investment theories, favoring their personal preferences instead. This presents a challenge for stock recommendation systems, which must not only provide strong investment performance but also respect these individual preferences. To create effective stock recommender systems, three critical elements must be incorporated: 1) individual preferences, 2) portfolio diversification, and 3) the temporal dynamics of the first two. In response, we propose a new model, Portfolio Temporal Graph Network Recommender, PfoTGNRec, which can handle time-varying collaborative signals and incorporates diversification-enhancing sampling. On real-world individual trading data, our approach demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, including cutting-edge dynamic embedding models and existing stock recommendation models. Indeed, we show that PfoTGNRec is an effective solution that can balance customer preferences with the need to suggest portfolios with high Return-on-Investment.

Recent studies have focused on improving the feature extraction capability of SNNs, but they suffer from inefficient inference and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective temporal reversed training (TRT) method to optimize the spatio-temporal performance of SNNs and circumvent these problems. We perturb the input temporal data by temporal reversal, prompting the SNN to produce original-reversed consistent output logits and to learn perturbation-invariant representations. For static data without temporal dimension, we generalize this strategy by exploiting the inherent temporal property of spiking neurons for spike feature temporal reversal. In addition, we utilize the lightweight ``star operation" (element-wise multiplication) to hybridize the original and temporally reversed spike firing rates and expand the implicit dimensions, which serves as spatio-temporal regularization to further enhance the generalization of the SNN. Our method involves only an additional temporal reversal operation and element-wise multiplication during training, thus incurring negligible training overhead and not affecting the inference efficiency at all. Extensive experiments on static/neuromorphic object/action recognition, and 3D point cloud classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method. In particular, with only two timesteps, our method achieves 74.77\% and 90.57\% accuracy on ImageNet and ModelNet40, respectively.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |

However, existing models often face limitations in generalization, struggling with zero-shot prediction on unseen regions and cities, as well as diminished long-term accuracy. This is primarily due to the inherent challenges in handling the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of traffic data, coupled with the significant distribution shift across time and space. In this work, we aim to unlock new possibilities for building versatile, resilient and adaptive spatio-temporal foundation models for traffic prediction. To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel foundation model, named OpenCity, that can effectively capture and normalize the underlying spatio-temporal patterns from diverse data characteristics, facilitating zero-shot generalization across diverse urban environments. OpenCity integrates the Transformer architecture with graph neural networks to model the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in traffic data. By pre-training OpenCity on large-scale, heterogeneous traffic datasets, we enable the model to learn rich, generalizable representations that can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of traffic forecasting scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that OpenCity exhibits exceptional zero-shot predictive performance. Moreover, OpenCity showcases promising scaling laws, suggesting the potential for developing a truly one-for-all traffic prediction solution that can adapt to new urban contexts with minimal overhead. We made our proposed OpenCity model open-source and it is available at the following link: https://github.com/HKUDS/OpenCity.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Unlike conventional test cases that offer a static snapshot of system profile, the designed TX-123BT system incorporates weather-dependent profiles for renewable generation and transmission thermal limits, mimicking the actual Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) system characteristics. Three weather-dependent models are used for the creation of wind and solar power production, and dynamic line rating (DLR) separately. Security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) is conducted on TX-123BT daily profiles and numerical results are compared with the actual ERCOT system for validation. The long-term spatio-temporal profiles can greatly capture the renewable production versatility due to the environmental conditions.

In this paper, we focus on medical temporal variation modeling, \emph{i.e.,} cuffless blood pressure (BP) monitoring which has great value in cardiovascular healthcare. Although providing a comfortable user experience, such methods are suffering from the demand for a significant amount of realistic data to train an individual model for each subject, especially considering the invasive or obtrusive BP ground-truth measurements. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel physics-informed temporal network~(PITN) with adversarial contrastive learning to enable precise BP estimation with very limited data. Specifically, we first enhance the physics-informed neural network~(PINN) with the temporal block for investigating BP dynamics' multi-periodicity for personal cardiovascular cycle modeling and temporal variation. We then employ adversarial training to generate extra physiological time series data, improving PITN's robustness in the face of sparse subject-specific training data. Furthermore, we utilize contrastive learning to capture the discriminative variations of cardiovascular physiologic phenomena. This approach aggregates physiological signals with similar blood pressure values in latent space while separating clusters of samples with dissimilar blood pressure values. Experiments on three widely-adopted datasets with different modailties (\emph{i.e.,} bioimpedance, PPG, millimeter-wave) demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed methods over previous state-of-the-art approaches.

Their scalar output, however, obfuscates when or what individual future rewards an agent may expect to receive. We address this by modifying an agent's future reward estimator to predict their next N expected rewards, referred to as Temporal Reward Decomposition (TRD). This unlocks novel explanations of agent behaviour. Through TRD we can: estimate when an agent may expect to receive a reward, the value of the reward and the agent's confidence in receiving it; measure an input feature's temporal importance to the agent's action decisions; and predict the influence of different actions on future rewards. Furthermore, we show that DQN agents trained on Atari environments can be efficiently retrained to incorporate TRD with minimal impact on performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages + 3 pages of supplementary material.

The safety risk and urgency of autonomous vehicles in the absence of collision are evaluated. To ensure safety and improve road efficiency, a method of pre-compiling the spatio-temporal trajectory of vehicles is established to eliminate conflicts between vehicles in advance. The calculation method of the safe distance under spatio-temporal conditions is studied, considering vehicle speed differences, vehicle positioning errors, and clock errors. By combining collision acceleration and urgent acceleration, an evaluation model for vehicle conflict risk is constructed. Mainline vehicles that may have conflicts with on-ramp vehicles are identified, and the target gap for on-ramp vehicles is determined. Finally, a cooperative control method is established based on the selected target gap, preparing the vehicle travel path in advance. Taking highway ramp merge as an example, the mainline priority spatio-temporal cooperative control method is proposed and verified through simulation.

Although good performance can be achieved, however, seldom of they consider the motion cues which may also be vital. In this work, we revisit the widely adopted bi-temporal images-based framework and propose a novel Coarse-grained Temporal Mining Augmented (CTMA) framework. To be specific, given the bi-temporal images, we first transform them into a video using interpolation operations. Then, a set of temporal encoders is adopted to extract the motion features from the obtained video for coarse-grained changed region prediction. Subsequently, we design a novel Coarse-grained Foregrounds Augmented Spatial Encoder module to integrate both global and local information. We also introduce a motion augmented strategy that leverages motion cues as an additional output to aggregate with the spatial features for improved results. Meanwhile, we feed the input image pairs into the ResNet to get the different features and also the spatial blocks for fine-grained feature learning. More importantly, we propose a mask augmented strategy that utilizes coarse-grained changed regions, incorporating them into the decoder blocks to enhance the final changed prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework for remote sensing image change detection.

Existing graph-based representation learning frameworks have made significant strides in developing evolving representations for both entities and relational embeddings. Despite these achievements, there's a notable tendency in these models to inadvertently learn biased data representations and mine spurious correlations, consequently failing to discern the causal relationships between events. This often leads to incorrect predictions based on these false correlations. To address this, we propose an innovative causal enhanced graph representation learning framework for TKGR (named CEGRL-TKGR). This framework introduces causal structures in graph-based representation learning to unveil the essential causal relationships between events, ultimately enhancing task performance. Specifically, we first disentangle the evolutionary representations of entities and relations in a temporal graph sequence into two distinct components, namely causal representations and confounding representations. Then, drawing on causal intervention theory, we advocate the utilization of causal representations for predictions, aiming to mitigate the effects of erroneous correlations caused by confounding features, thus achieving more robust and accurate predictions. Finally, extensive experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model in the link prediction task.</p></details> |  |
| **[System States Forecasting of Microservices with Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07894v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations) era, accurately forecasting system states is crucial. In microservices systems, this task encounters the challenge of dynamic and complex spatio-temporal relationships among microservice instances, primarily due to dynamic deployments, diverse call paths, and cascading effects among instances. Current time-series forecasting methods, which focus mainly on intrinsic patterns, are insufficient in environments where spatial relationships are critical. Similarly, spatio-temporal graph approaches often neglect the nature of temporal trend, concentrating mostly on message passing between nodes. Moreover, current research in microservices domain frequently underestimates the importance of network metrics and topological structures in capturing the evolving dynamics of systems. This paper introduces STMformer, a model tailored for forecasting system states in microservices environments, capable of handling multi-node and multivariate time series. Our method leverages dynamic network connection data and topological information to assist in modeling the intricate spatio-temporal relationships within the system. Additionally, we integrate the PatchCrossAttention module to compute the impact of cascading effects globally. We have developed a dataset based on a microservices system and conducted comprehensive experiments with STMformer against leading methods. In both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks, our model consistently achieved a 8.6% reduction in MAE(Mean Absolute Error) and a 2.2% reduction in MSE (Mean Squared Error).

Nonetheless, these methods mainly adopt imagepair appearance matching and face challenges of the intrinsic high quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism, resulting in constrained exploitation of temporal information. Inspired by the recently emerged State Space Model Mamba, renowned for its impressive long sequence modeling capabilities and linear computational complexity, this work innovatively proposes a pure Mamba-based framework (MambaVT) to fully exploit spatio-temporal contextual modeling for robust visible-thermal tracking. Specifically, we devise the long-range cross-frame integration component to globally adapt to target appearance variations, and introduce short-term historical trajectory prompts to predict the subsequent target states based on local temporal location clues. Extensive experiments show the significant potential of vision Mamba for RGB-T tracking, with MambaVT achieving state-of-the-art performance on four mainstream benchmarks while requiring lower computational costs. We aim for this work to serve as a simple yet strong baseline, stimulating future research in this field. The code and pre-trained models will be made available.</p></details> |  |
| **[LoAS: Fully Temporal-Parallel Datatflow for Dual-Sparse Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14073v2)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant research attention in the last decade due to their potential to drive resource-constrained edge devices. Though existing SNN accelerators offer high efficiency in processing sparse spikes with dense weights, opportunities are less explored in SNNs with sparse weights, i.e., dual-sparsity. In this work, we study the acceleration of dual-sparse SNNs, focusing on their core operation, sparse-matrix-sparse-matrix multiplication (spMspM). We observe that naively running a dual-sparse SNN on existing spMspM accelerators designed for dual-sparse Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) exhibits sub-optimal efficiency. The main challenge is that processing timesteps, a natural property of SNNs, introduces an extra loop to ANN spMspM, leading to longer latency and more memory traffic. To address the problem, we propose a fully temporal-parallel (FTP) dataflow, which minimizes both data movement across timesteps and the end-to-end latency of dual-sparse SNNs. To maximize the efficiency of FTP dataflow, we propose an FTP-friendly spike compression mechanism that efficiently compresses single-bit spikes and ensures contiguous memory access. We further propose an FTP-friendly inner-join circuit that can lower the cost of the expensive prefix-sum circuits with almost no throughput penalty. All the above techniques for FTP dataflow are encapsulated in LoAS, a Low-latency inference Accelerator for dual-sparse SNNs. With FTP dataflow, compression, and inner-join, running dual-sparse SNN workloads on LoAS demonstrates significant speedup (up to $8.51\times$) and energy reduction (up to $3.68\times$) compared to running it on prior dual-sparse accelerators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MICRO 2024.

However, as task complexity increases, sc-LTL formulas become lengthy, making them difficult to interpret and generate, and straining the computational capacities of planners. To address this, we introduce a hierarchical structure to sc-LTL specifications with both syntax and semantics, proving it to be more expressive than flat counterparts. We conducted a user study that compared the flat sc-LTL with our hierarchical version and found that users could more easily comprehend complex tasks using the hierarchical structure. We develop a search-based approach to synthesize plans for multi-robot systems, achieving simultaneous task allocation and planning. This method approximates the search space by loosely interconnected sub-spaces, each corresponding to an sc-LTL specification. The search primarily focuses on a single sub-space, transitioning to another under conditions determined by the decomposition of automatons. We develop multiple heuristics to significantly expedite the search. Our theoretical analysis, conducted under mild assumptions, addresses completeness and optimality. Compared to existing methods used in various simulators for service tasks, our approach improves planning times while maintaining comparable solution quality.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |

The dataset comprises pairs of finite-time system traces and corresponding labels, denoting whether the traces demonstrate specific desired behaviors, e.g. whether the ship follows a safe route or not. Our proposed approach leverages decision-tree-based methods to infer Signal Temporal Logic classifiers using primitive formulae. We formulate the inference process as a mixed integer linear programming optimization problem, recursively generating constraints to determine both data classification and tree structure. Applying a max-flow algorithm on the resultant tree transforms the problem into a global optimization challenge, leading to improved classification rates compared to prior methodologies. Moreover, we introduce a technique to reduce the number of constraints by exploiting the symmetry inherent in STL primitives, which enhances the algorithm's time performance and interpretability. To assess our algorithm's effectiveness and classification performance, we conduct three case studies involving two-class, multi-class, and complex formula classification scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Spatio-Temporal Processing in Spiking Neural Networks through Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07517v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient implementations of spiking neural networks on neuromorphic hardware promise orders of magnitude less power consumption than their non-spiking counterparts. The standard neuron model for spike-based computation on such neuromorphic systems has long been the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron. As a promising advancement, a computationally light augmentation of the LIF neuron model with an adaptation mechanism experienced a recent upswing in popularity, caused by demonstrations of its superior performance on spatio-temporal processing tasks. The root of the superiority of these so-called adaptive LIF neurons however, is not well understood. In this article, we thoroughly analyze the dynamical, computational, and learning properties of adaptive LIF neurons and networks thereof. We find that the frequently observed stability problems during training of such networks can be overcome by applying an alternative discretization method that results in provably better stability properties than the commonly used Euler-Forward method. With this discretization, we achieved a new state-of-the-art performance on common event-based benchmark datasets. We also show that the superiority of networks of adaptive LIF neurons extends to the prediction and generation of complex time series. Our further analysis of the computational properties of networks of adaptive LIF neurons shows that they are particularly well suited to exploit the spatio-temporal structure of input sequences. Furthermore, these networks are surprisingly robust to shifts of the mean input strength and input spike rate, even when these shifts were not observed during training. As a consequence, high-performance networks can be obtained without any normalization techniques such as batch normalization or batch-normalization through time.</p></details> |  |

The weak dependence condition for arrays of random fields is proved to be inherited through transformation and infinite shift. This paves a way to prove the consistency and asymptotic normality of maximum likelihood estimation for dynamic spatio-temporal models (i.e. so-called ultra high-dimensional time series models) when the sample size and/or dimension go to infinity. Especially the asymptotic properties of estimation for network autoregression are obtained under reasonable regularity conditions.</p></details> |  |

Modeling the Ambiguity in Event Temporal Relation Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07353v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event Temporal Relation Extraction (ETRE) aims to identify the temporal relationship between two events, which plays an important role in natural language understanding. Most previous works follow a single-label classification style, classifying an event pair into either a specific temporal relation (e.g., \textit{Before}, \textit{After}), or a special label \textit{Vague} when there may be multiple possible temporal relations between the pair. In our work, instead of directly making predictions on \textit{Vague}, we propose a multi-label classification solution for ETRE (METRE) to infer the possibility of each temporal relation independently, where we treat \textit{Vague} as the cases when there is more than one possible relation between two events. We design a speculation mechanism to explore the possible relations hidden behind \textit{Vague}, which enables the latent information to be used efficiently. Experiments on TB-Dense, MATRES and UDS-T show that our method can effectively utilize the \textit{Vague} instances to improve the recognition for specific temporal relations and outperforms most state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

It aims to advance the development of countermeasure (CM) to discriminate bonafide and spoofed speech utterances. In this paper, we focus on addressing the problem of open-domain audio deepfake detection, which corresponds directly to the ASVspoof5 Track1 open condition. At first, we comprehensively investigate various CM on ASVspoof5, including data expansion, data augmentation, and self-supervised learning (SSL) features. Due to the high-frequency gaps characteristic of the ASVspoof5 dataset, we introduce Frequency Mask, a data augmentation method that masks specific frequency bands to improve CM robustness. Combining various scale of temporal information with multiple SSL features, our experiments achieved a minDCF of 0.0158 and an EER of 0.55% on the ASVspoof 5 Track 1 evaluation progress set.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection and Localization with Spatio-Temporal Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05905v2)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WSVAD) task aims to achieve frame-level anomalous event detection with only coarse video-level annotations available. Existing works typically involve extracting global features from full-resolution video frames and training frame-level classifiers to detect anomalies in the temporal dimension. However, most anomalous events tend to occur in localized spatial regions rather than the entire video frames, which implies existing frame-level feature based works may be misled by the dominant background information and lack the interpretation of the detected anomalies. To address this dilemma, this paper introduces a novel method called STPrompt that learns spatio-temporal prompt embeddings for weakly supervised video anomaly detection and localization (WSVADL) based on pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). Our proposed method employs a two-stream network structure, with one stream focusing on the temporal dimension and the other primarily on the spatial dimension. By leveraging the learned knowledge from pre-trained VLMs and incorporating natural motion priors from raw videos, our model learns prompt embeddings that are aligned with spatio-temporal regions of videos (e.g., patches of individual frames) for identify specific local regions of anomalies, enabling accurate video anomaly detection while mitigating the influence of background information. Without relying on detailed spatio-temporal annotations or auxiliary object detection/tracking, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks for the WSVADL task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM2024</p></details> |

Although advanced methods have achieved impressive success in lab scenarios, most of them perform poorly in the wild. Recently, some Convolution Neural Networks (ConvNets) based methods have been proposed to address the issue of gait recognition in the wild. However, the temporal receptive field obtained by convolution operations is limited for long gait sequences. If directly replacing convolution blocks with visual transformer blocks, the model may not enhance a local temporal receptive field, which is important for covering a complete gait cycle. To address this issue, we design a Global-Local Temporal Receptive Field Network (GLGait). GLGait employs a Global-Local Temporal Module (GLTM) to establish a global-local temporal receptive field, which mainly consists of a Pseudo Global Temporal Self-Attention (PGTA) and a temporal convolution operation. Specifically, PGTA is used to obtain a pseudo global temporal receptive field with less memory and computation complexity compared with a multi-head self-attention (MHSA). The temporal convolution operation is used to enhance the local temporal receptive field. Besides, it can also aggregate pseudo global temporal receptive field to a true holistic temporal receptive field. Furthermore, we also propose a Center-Augmented Triplet Loss (CTL) in GLGait to reduce the intra-class distance and expand the positive samples in the training stage. Extensive experiments show that our method obtains state-of-the-art results on in-the-wild datasets, $i.e.$, Gait3D and GREW.

In addition to pre-trained video models, contemporary methods utilize pre-trained vision-language models (VLM) to capture detailed characteristics of diverse scenes and objects from video frames. However, as pre-trained on images, VLM may struggle to distinguish action-sensitive patterns from static objects, making it necessary to adapt them to specific data domains for effective feature representation over temporal grounding. We address two primary challenges to achieve this goal. Specifically, to mitigate high adaptation costs, we propose an efficient preliminary in-domain fine-tuning paradigm for feature adaptation, where downstream-adaptive features are learned through several pretext tasks. Furthermore, to integrate action-sensitive information into VLM, we introduce Action-Cue-Injected Temporal Prompt Learning (ActPrompt), which injects action cues into the image encoder of VLM for better discovering action-sensitive patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ActPrompt is an off-the-shelf training framework that can be effectively applied to various SOTA methods, resulting in notable improvements.

To achieve this, we exploit a simple proxy task of ordering a shuffled image sequence, with `time' serving as a supervisory signal, since only changes that are monotonic with time can give rise to the correct ordering. We also introduce a transformer-based model for ordering of image sequences of arbitrary length with built-in attribution maps. After training, the model successfully discovers and localizes monotonic changes while ignoring cyclic and stochastic ones. We demonstrate applications of the model in multiple domains covering different scene and object types, discovering both object-level and environmental changes in unseen sequences. We also demonstrate that the attention-based attribution maps function as effective prompts for segmenting the changing regions, and that the learned representations can be used for downstream applications. Finally, we show that the model achieves the state-of-the-art on standard benchmarks for image ordering.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024 Oral.

Current approaches usually embed factual knowledge into continuous vector space and apply geometric operations to learn potential patterns in temporal knowledge graphs. However, these methods only adopt a single operation, which may have limitations in capturing the complex temporal dynamics present in temporal knowledge graphs. Therefore, we propose a simple but effective method, i.e. TCompoundE, which is specially designed with two geometric operations, including time-specific and relation-specific operations. We provide mathematical proofs to demonstrate the ability of TCompoundE to encode various relation patterns. Experimental results show that our proposed model significantly outperforms existing temporal knowledge graph embedding models.

However, its potential in the domain of multi-frame 3D object detection remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present STEMD, a novel end-to-end framework that enhances the DETR-like paradigm for multi-frame 3D object detection by addressing three key aspects specifically tailored for this task. First, to model the inter-object spatial interaction and complex temporal dependencies, we introduce the spatial-temporal graph attention network, which represents queries as nodes in a graph and enables effective modeling of object interactions within a social context. To solve the problem of missing hard cases in the proposed output of the encoder in the current frame, we incorporate the output of the previous frame to initialize the query input of the decoder. Finally, it poses a challenge for the network to distinguish between the positive query and other highly similar queries that are not the best match. And similar queries are insufficiently suppressed and turn into redundant prediction boxes. To address this issue, our proposed IoU regularization term encourages similar queries to be distinct during the refinement. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling challenging scenarios, while incurring only a minor additional computational overhead.

| **[Neural Dynamical Operator: Continuous Spatial-Temporal Model with Gradient-Based and Derivative-Free Optimization Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11798v3)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven modeling techniques have been explored in the spatial-temporal modeling of complex dynamical systems for many engineering applications. However, a systematic approach is still lacking to leverage the information from different types of data, e.g., with different spatial and temporal resolutions, and the combined use of short-term trajectories and long-term statistics. In this work, we build on the recent progress of neural operator and present a data-driven modeling framework called neural dynamical operator that is continuous in both space and time. A key feature of the neural dynamical operator is the resolution-invariance with respect to both spatial and temporal discretizations, without demanding abundant training data in different temporal resolutions. To improve the long-term performance of the calibrated model, we further propose a hybrid optimization scheme that leverages both gradient-based and derivative-free optimization methods and efficiently trains on both short-term time series and long-term statistics. We investigate the performance of the neural dynamical operator with three numerical examples, including the viscous Burgers' equation, the Navier-Stokes equations, and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. The results confirm the resolution-invariance of the proposed modeling framework and also demonstrate stable long-term simulations with only short-term time series data. In addition, we show that the proposed model can better predict long-term statistics via the hybrid optimization scheme with a combined use of short-term and long-term data.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements such as Online Temporal Action Localization (OnTAL), extend this approach to instance-level predictions. However, existing methods mainly focus on short-term context, neglecting historical information. To address this, we introduce the History-Augmented Anchor Transformer (HAT) Framework for OnTAL. By integrating historical context, our framework enhances the synergy between long-term and short-term information, improving the quality of anchor features crucial for classification and localization. We evaluate our model on both procedural egocentric (PREGO) datasets (EGTEA and EPIC) and standard non-PREGO OnTAL datasets (THUMOS and MUSES). Results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches significantly on PREGO datasets and achieves comparable or slightly superior performance on non-PREGO datasets, underscoring the importance of leveraging long-term history, especially in procedural and egocentric action scenarios.

Compared with existing high-end DECT leveraging advanced X-ray source and/or detector technologies, the use of the sequentially-scanning data acquisition scheme to implement DECT may make broader impact on clinical practice because this scheme requires no specialized hardware designs. However, since the concentration of iodinated contrast agent in the imaged subject varies over time, sequentially-scanned data sets acquired at two tube potentials are temporally inconsistent. As existing material decomposition approaches for DECT assume that the data sets acquired at two tube potentials are temporally consistent, the violation of this assumption results in inaccurate quantification accuracy of iodine concentration. In this work, we developed a technique to achieve sequentially-scanning DECT imaging using high temporal resolution image reconstruction and temporal extrapolation, ACCELERATION in short, to address the technical challenge induced by temporal inconsistency of sequentially-scanned data sets and improve iodine quantification accuracy in sequentially-scanning DECT. ACCELERATION has been validated and evaluated using numerical simulation data sets generated from clinical human subject exams. Results demonstrated the improvement of iodine quantification accuracy using ACCELERATION.</p></details> |  |

Despite the improvement brought by the strong visual backbone in extracting spatial features, CLIP still falls short in capturing and integrating spatial-temporal features which is essential for video recognition. In this paper, we propose OmniCLIP, a framework that adapts CLIP for video recognition by focusing on learning comprehensive features encompassing spatial, temporal, and dynamic spatial-temporal scales, which we refer to as omni-scale features. This is achieved through the design of spatial-temporal blocks that include parallel temporal adapters (PTA), enabling efficient temporal modeling. Additionally, we introduce a self-prompt generator (SPG) module to capture dynamic object spatial features. The synergy between PTA and SPG allows OmniCLIP to discern varying spatial information across frames and assess object scales over time. We have conducted extensive experiments in supervised video recognition, few-shot video recognition, and zero-shot recognition tasks. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, especially with OmniCLIP achieving a top-1 accuracy of 74.30\% on HMDB51 in a 16-shot setting, surpassing the recent MotionPrompt approach even with full training data.

By imposing rotation, translation, and permutation equivariance inductive biases in both space and time, we show that the Spacetime $E(n)$-Transformer (SET) outperforms purely spatial and temporal models without symmetry-preserving properties. We benchmark SET against said models on the charged $N$-body problem, a simple physical system with complex dynamics. While existing spatio-temporal graph neural networks focus on sequential modeling, we empirically demonstrate that leveraging underlying domain symmetries yields considerable improvements for modeling dynamical systems on graphs.</p></details> |  |

Since many existing works optimize WTAL models based on action classification labels, they encounter the task discrepancy problem (i.e., localization-by-classification). To tackle this issue, recent studies have attempted to utilize action category names as auxiliary semantic knowledge through vision-language pre-training (VLP). However, there are still areas where existing research falls short. Previous approaches primarily focused on leveraging textual information from language models but overlooked the alignment of dynamic human action and VLP knowledge in a joint space. Furthermore, the deterministic representation employed in previous studies struggles to capture fine-grained human motions. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework that aligns human action knowledge and VLP knowledge in a probabilistic embedding space. Moreover, we propose intra- and inter-distribution contrastive learning to enhance the probabilistic embedding space based on statistical similarities. Extensive experiments and ablation studies reveal that our method significantly outperforms all previous state-of-the-art methods.

Despite significant strides in time series forecasting, high noise-to-signal ratio, non-normality, non-stationarity, and lack of data continue challenging practitioners. In response, we leverage a simple representation augmentation technique to overcome these challenges. Our augmented representation acts as a statistical-space prior encoded at each time step. In response, we name our method Statistical-space Augmented Representation (SSAR). The underlying high-dimensional data-generating process inspires our representation augmentation. We rigorously examine the empirical generalization performance on two data sets with two downstream temporal learning algorithms. Our approach significantly beats all five up-to-date baselines. Moreover, the highly modular nature of our approach can easily be applied to various settings. Lastly, fully-fledged theoretical perspectives are available throughout the writing for a clear and rigorous understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>IJCAI...</summary><p>IJCAI 2024 STRL Workshop (Oral)</p></details> |

This brain area also contains place cells, whose location-selective firing fields implement maps supporting spatial memory. Here we show that place cells emerge in networks trained to remember temporally continuous sensory episodes. We model CA3 as a recurrent autoencoder that recalls and reconstructs sensory experiences from noisy and partially occluded observations by agents traversing simulated rooms. The agents move in realistic trajectories modeled from rodents and environments are modeled as high-dimensional sensory experience maps. Training our autoencoder to pattern-complete and reconstruct experiences with a constraint on total activity causes spatially localized firing fields, i.e., place cells, to emerge in the encoding layer. The emergent place fields reproduce key aspects of hippocampal phenomenology: a) remapping (maintenance of and reversion to distinct learned maps in different environments), implemented via repositioning of experience manifolds in the network's hidden layer, b) orthogonality of spatial representations in different arenas, c) robust place field emergence in differently shaped rooms, with single units showing multiple place fields in large or complex spaces, and d) slow representational drift of place fields. We argue that these results arise because continuous traversal of space makes sensory experience temporally continuous. We make testable predictions: a) rapidly changing sensory context will disrupt place fields, b) place fields will form even if recurrent connections are blocked, but reversion to previously learned representations upon remapping will be abolished, c) the dimension of temporally smooth experience sets the dimensionality of place fields, including during virtual navigation of abstract spaces.</p></details> |  |

This paper focuses on the unified construction of sequential networks from MTL specifications over discrete and dense time behaviors to provide an efficient and scalable online monitoring framework. Our core technique, future temporal marking, utilizes interval-based symbolic representations of future discrete and dense timelines. Building upon this, we develop efficient update and output functions for sequential network nodes for timed temporal operations. Finally, we extensively test and compare our proposed technique with existing approaches and runtime verification tools.

While increasing biomedical tasks have employed state-of-the-art language models, there are very few studies have examined temporal effects on biomedical models when data usually shifts across development and deployment. This study fills the gap by statistically probing relations between language model performance and data shifts across three biomedical tasks. We deploy diverse metrics to evaluate model performance, distance methods to measure data drifts, and statistical methods to quantify temporal effects on biomedical language models. Our study shows that time matters for deploying biomedical language models, while the degree of performance degradation varies by biomedical tasks and statistical quantification approaches. We believe this study can establish a solid benchmark to evaluate and assess temporal effects on deploying biomedical language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AMIA 2024 Annual Symposium</p></details> |

First, the similar appearances of objects degrade ReID performances. This challenge cannot be addressed by existing appearance-based ReID methods. Second, most ReID studies are performed in laboratory settings and do not consider ReID problems in real-world scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel ReID framework that leverages a spatial-temporal fusion network and causal identity matching (CIM). The framework estimates camera network topology using the proposed adaptive Parzen window and combines appearance features with spatial-temporal cue within the Fusion Network. It achieved outstanding performance across several datasets, including VeRi776, Vehicle-3I, and Market-1501, achieving up to 99.70% rank-1 accuracy and 95.5% mAP. Furthermore, the proposed CIM approach, which dynamically assigns gallery sets based on the camera network topology, further improved ReID accuracy and robustness in real-world settings, evidenced by a 94.95% mAP and 95.19% F1 score on the Vehicle-3I dataset. The experimental results support the effectiveness of incorporating spatial-temporal information and CIM for real-world ReID scenarios regardless of the data domain (e.g., vehicle, person).</p></details> |  |
| **[Higher-Order Temporal Network Prediction and Interpretation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05165v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A social interaction (so-called higher-order event/interaction) can be regarded as the activation of the hyperlink among the corresponding individuals. Social interactions can be, thus, represented as higher-order temporal networks, that record the higher-order events occurring at each time step over time. The prediction of higher-order interactions is usually overlooked in traditional temporal network prediction methods, where a higher-order interaction is regarded as a set of pairwise interactions. The prediction of future higher-order interactions is crucial to forecast and mitigate the spread the information, epidemics and opinion on higher-order social contact networks. In this paper, we propose novel memory-based models for higher-order temporal network prediction. By using these models, we aim to predict the higher-order temporal network one time step ahead, based on the network observed in the past. Importantly, we also intent to understand what network properties and which types of previous interactions enable the prediction. The design and performance analysis of these models are supported by our analysis of the memory property of networks, e.g., similarity of the network and activity of a hyperlink over time respectively. Our models assume that a target hyperlink's future activity (active or not) depends the past activity of the target link and of all or selected types of hyperlinks that overlap with the target. We then compare the performance of both models with a baseline utilizing a pairwise temporal network prediction method. In eight real-world networks, we find that both models consistently outperform the baseline and the refined model tends to perform the best. Our models also reveal how past interactions of the target hyperlink and different types of hyperlinks that overlap with the target contribute to the prediction of the target's future activity.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2309.04376</p></details> |

Considering the spatio-temporal nature of EEG data, one of our frameworks is based on a CNN-BiLSTM model. The other involves a CNN-Transformer architecture which inherently involves the more versatile attention based learning paradigm. In both cases, a special 1D-CNN feature extraction module is used to generate the initial embeddings with 1D convolutions in the time and the EEG channel domains. Considering the EEG signals are noisy, non stationary and the discriminative features are even less clear (than in semantically structured data such as text or image), we also follow a window-based classification followed by majority voting during inference, to yield labels at a signal level. To illustrate how brain patterns correlate with different image classes, we visualize t-SNE plots of the BiLSTM embeddings alongside brain activation maps for the top 10 classes. These visualizations provide insightful revelations into the distinct neural signatures associated with each visual category, showcasing the BiLSTM's capability to capture and represent the discriminative brain activity linked to visual stimuli. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on the updated EEG-Imagenet dataset with positive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been submitted at ICPR 2024.

In particular, two problems emerge: (1) Encoding longer histories requires more computational resources, making it crucial for CTDG models to maintain low computational complexity to ensure efficiency; (2) Meanwhile, more powerful models are needed to identify and select the most critical temporal information within the extended context provided by longer histories. To address these problems, we propose a CTDG representation learning model named DyGMamba, originating from the popular Mamba state space model (SSM). DyGMamba first leverages a node-level SSM to encode the sequence of historical node interactions. Another time-level SSM is then employed to exploit the temporal patterns hidden in the historical graph, where its output is used to dynamically select the critical information from the interaction history. We validate DyGMamba experimentally on the dynamic link prediction task. The results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art in most cases. DyGMamba also maintains high efficiency in terms of computational resources, making it possible to capture long temporal dependencies with a limited computation budget.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

We consider missions that require accomplishing multiple high-level sub-tasks, expressed in natural language (NL), in a temporal and logical order. To formally define the mission, we treat these sub-tasks as atomic predicates in a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula. We refer to this task specification framework as LTL-NL. Our goal is to design plans, defined as sequences of robot actions, accomplishing LTL-NL tasks. This action planning problem cannot be solved directly by existing LTL planners because of the NL nature of atomic predicates. To address it, we propose HERACLEs, a hierarchical neuro-symbolic planner that relies on a novel integration of (i) existing symbolic planners generating high-level task plans determining the order at which the NL sub-tasks should be accomplished; (ii) pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to design sequences of robot actions based on these task plans; and (iii) conformal prediction acting as a formal interface between (i) and (ii) and managing uncertainties due to LLM imperfections. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that HERACLEs can achieve user-defined mission success rates. Finally, we provide comparative experiments demonstrating that HERACLEs outperforms LLM-based planners that require the mission to be defined solely using NL. Additionally, we present examples demonstrating that our approach enhances user-friendliness compared to conventional symbolic approaches.</p></details> |  |

Learning temporal properties has crystallized as an effective mean to explain complex temporal behaviors. Several efficient algorithms have been designed for learning temporal formulas. However, the theoretical understanding of the complexity of the learning decision problems remains largely unexplored. To address this, we study the complexity of the passive learning problems of three prominent temporal logics, Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and Alternating-time Temporal Logic (ATL) and several of their fragments. We show that learning formulas using an unbounded amount of occurrences of binary operators is NP-complete for all of these logics. On the other hand, when investigating the complexity of learning formulas with bounded amount of occurrences of binary operators, we exhibit discrepancies between the complexity of learning LTL, CTL and ATL formulas (with a varying number of agents).</p></details> |  |
| **[MM-Forecast: A Multimodal Approach to Temporal Event Forecasting with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04388v1)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study an emerging and intriguing problem of multimodal temporal event forecasting with large language models. Compared to using text or graph modalities, the investigation of utilizing images for temporal event forecasting has not been fully explored, especially in the era of large language models (LLMs). To bridge this gap, we are particularly interested in two key questions of: 1) why images will help in temporal event forecasting, and 2) how to integrate images into the LLM-based forecasting framework. To answer these research questions, we propose to identify two essential functions that images play in the scenario of temporal event forecasting, i.e., highlighting and complementary. Then, we develop a novel framework, named MM-Forecast. It employs an Image Function Identification module to recognize these functions as verbal descriptions using multimodal large language models (MLLMs), and subsequently incorporates these function descriptions into LLM-based forecasting models. To evaluate our approach, we construct a new multimodal dataset, MidEast-TE-mm, by extending an existing event dataset MidEast-TE-mini with images. Empirical studies demonstrate that our MM-Forecast can correctly identify the image functions, and further more, incorporating these verbal function descriptions significantly improves the forecasting performance. The dataset, code, and prompts are available at https://github.com/LuminosityX/MM-Forecast.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Logic Planning via Zero-Shot Policy Composition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04215v1)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work develops a zero-shot mechanism for an agent to satisfy a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) specification given existing task primitives. Oftentimes, autonomous robots need to satisfy spatial and temporal goals that are unknown until run time. Prior research addresses the problem by learning policies that are capable of executing a high-level task specified using LTL, but they incorporate the specification into the learning process; therefore, any change to the specification requires retraining the policy. Other related research addresses the problem by creating skill-machines which, given a specification change, do not require full policy retraining but require fine-tuning on the skill-machine to guarantee satisfaction. We present a more a flexible approach -- to learn a set of minimum-violation (MV) task primitive policies that can be used to satisfy arbitrary LTL specifications without retraining or fine-tuning. Task primitives can be learned offline using reinforcement learning (RL) methods and combined using Boolean composition at deployment. This work focuses on creating and pruning a transition system (TS) representation of the environment in order to solve for deterministic, non-ambiguous, and feasible solutions to LTL specifications given an environment and a set of MV task primitive policies. We show that our pruned TS is deterministic, contains no unrealizable transitions, and is sound. Through simulation, we show that our approach is executable and we verify our MV policies produce the expected symbols.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

Unlike other time series forecasting problems, crime incidents are sparse, particularly in small regions and within specific time periods. Traditional spatial-temporal deep learning models often struggle with this sparsity, as they typically cannot effectively handle the non-Gaussian nature of crime data, which is characterized by numerous zeros and over-dispersed patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach termed Spatial Temporal Multivariate Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Graph Neural Networks (STMGNN-ZINB). This framework leverages diffusion and convolution networks to analyze spatial, temporal, and multivariate correlations, enabling the parameterization of probabilistic distributions of crime incidents. By incorporating a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial model, STMGNN-ZINB effectively manages the sparse nature of crime data, enhancing prediction accuracy and the precision of confidence intervals. Our evaluation on real-world datasets confirms that STMGNN-ZINB outperforms existing models, providing a more reliable tool for predicting and understanding crime dynamics.</p></details> |  |

Efficient Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is crucial to address these issues. However, unlike traditional models, diffusion models critically rely on the time-step for the multi-round denoising. Typically, each time-step is encoded into a hypersensitive temporal feature by several modules. Despite this, existing PTQ methods do not optimize these modules individually. Instead, they employ unsuitable reconstruction objectives and complex calibration methods, leading to significant disturbances in the temporal feature and denoising trajectory, as well as reduced compression efficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel quantization framework that includes three strategies: 1) TIB-based Maintenance: Based on our innovative Temporal Information Block (TIB) definition, Temporal Information-aware Reconstruction (TIAR) and Finite Set Calibration (FSC) are developed to efficiently align original temporal features. 2) Cache-based Maintenance: Instead of indirect and complex optimization for the related modules, pre-computing and caching quantized counterparts of temporal features are developed to minimize errors. 3) Disturbance-aware Selection: Employ temporal feature errors to guide a fine-grained selection between the two maintenance strategies for further disturbance reduction. This framework preserves most of the temporal information and ensures high-quality end-to-end generation. Extensive testing on various datasets, diffusion models and hardware confirms our superior performance and acceleration..</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2311.16503</p></details> |

However, these methods have limitations in modeling spatial-temporal dependency and addressing spatial-temporal redundancy: 1) These methods fail to effectively model spatial-temporal dependency, due to the lack of long-range information or joint spatial-temporal modeling. 2) These methods utilize dense spatial features across the entire temporal resolution, resulting in significant spatial-temporal redundancy. In this paper, we propose the Surgical Transformer (Surgformer) to address the issues of spatial-temporal modeling and redundancy in an end-to-end manner, which employs divided spatial-temporal attention and takes a limited set of sparse frames as input. Moreover, we propose a novel Hierarchical Temporal Attention (HTA) to capture both global and local information within varied temporal resolutions from a target frame-centric perspective. Distinct from conventional temporal attention that primarily emphasizes dense long-range similarity, HTA not only captures long-term information but also considers local latent consistency among informative frames. HTA then employs pyramid feature aggregation to effectively utilize temporal information across diverse temporal resolutions, thereby enhancing the overall temporal representation. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmark datasets verify that our proposed Surgformer performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods.

Specifically, our goal is to achieve a given linear temporal logic (LTL) task with probability one, while maximizing the \emph{entropy rate} of the system. The notion of entropy rate characterizes the long-run average (un)predictability of a stochastic process. Such an optimal policy is of our interest, in particular, from the security point of view, as it not only ensures the completion of tasks, but also maximizes the unpredictability of the system. However, existing works only focus on maximizing the total entropy which may diverge to infinity for infinite horizon. In this paper, we provide a complete solution to the entropy rate maximization problem under LTL constraints. Specifically, we first present an algorithm for synthesizing entropy rate maximizing policies for communicating MDPs. Then based on a new state classification method, we show the entropy rate maximization problem under LTL task can be effectively solved in polynomial-time. We illustrate the proposed algorithm based on two case studies of robot task planning scenario.</p></details> |  |

However, existing transformer-based methods primarily use self-attention mechanisms for spatio-temporal modeling, leading to a quadratic complexity, unidirectional modeling of spatio-temporal relationships, and insufficient learning of spatial-temporal correlations. Recently, the Mamba architecture, utilizing the state space model (SSM), has exhibited superior long-range modeling capabilities in a variety of vision tasks with linear complexity. In this paper, we propose PoseMamba, a novel purely SSM-based approach with linear complexity for 3D human pose estimation in monocular video. Specifically, we propose a bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block that comprehensively models human joint relations within individual frames as well as temporal correlations across frames. Within this bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block, we introduce a reordering strategy to enhance the local modeling capability of the SSM. This strategy provides a more logical geometric scanning order and integrates it with the global SSM, resulting in a combined global-local spatial scan. We have quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated our approach using two benchmark datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoseMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets while maintaining a smaller model size and reducing computational costs. The code and models will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion Models for EEG Super-Resolution in Epilepsy Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03089v3)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, particularly high-density EEG (HD EEG) devices, is widely used in fields such as neuroscience. HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, meeting the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STADMs) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which then serve as conditional inputs to guide the reverse denoising process of diffusion models. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STADMs demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks of epilepsy patients, indicating their potential to significantly improve the spatial resolution of LR EEG.</p></details> |  |
| **[FacialPulse: An Efficient RNN-based Depression Detection via Temporal Facial Landmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03499v1)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder that significantly impacts individuals' lives and well-being. Early detection and intervention are crucial for effective treatment and management of depression. Recently, there are many end-to-end deep learning methods leveraging the facial expression features for automatic depression detection. However, most current methods overlook the temporal dynamics of facial expressions. Although very recent 3DCNN methods remedy this gap, they introduce more computational cost due to the selection of CNN-based backbones and redundant facial features. To address the above limitations, by considering the timing correlation of facial expressions, we propose a novel framework called FacialPulse, which recognizes depression with high accuracy and speed. By harnessing the bidirectional nature and proficiently addressing long-term dependencies, the Facial Motion Modeling Module (FMMM) is designed in FacialPulse to fully capture temporal features. Since the proposed FMMM has parallel processing capabilities and has the gate mechanism to mitigate gradient vanishing, this module can also significantly boost the training speed. Besides, to effectively use facial landmarks to replace original images to decrease information redundancy, a Facial Landmark Calibration Module (FLCM) is designed to eliminate facial landmark errors to further improve recognition accuracy. Extensive experiments on the AVEC2014 dataset and MMDA dataset (a depression dataset) demonstrate the superiority of FacialPulse on recognition accuracy and speed, with the average MAE (Mean Absolute Error) decreased by 21% compared to baselines, and the recognition speed increased by 100% compared to state-of-the-art methods. Codes are released at https://github.com/volatileee/FacialPulse.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpecSTG: A Fast Spectral Diffusion Framework for Probabilistic Spatio-Temporal Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08119v3)** | 2024-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting, a crucial application of spatio-temporal graph (STG) learning, has traditionally relied on deterministic models for accurate point estimations. Yet, these models fall short of quantifying future uncertainties. Recently, many probabilistic methods, especially variants of diffusion models, have been proposed to fill this gap. However, existing diffusion methods typically deal with individual sensors separately when generating future time series, resulting in limited usage of spatial information in the probabilistic learning process. In this work, we propose SpecSTG, a novel spectral diffusion framework, to better leverage spatial dependencies and systematic patterns inherent in traffic data. More specifically, our method generates the Fourier representation of future time series, transforming the learning process into the spectral domain enriched with spatial information. Additionally, our approach incorporates a fast spectral graph convolution designed for Fourier input, alleviating the computational burden associated with existing models. Compared with state-of-the-arts, SpecSTG achieves up to 8% improvements on point estimations and up to 0.78% improvements on quantifying future uncertainties. Furthermore, SpecSTG's training and validation speed is 3.33X of the most efficient existing diffusion method for STG forecasting. The source code for SpecSTG is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SpecSTG.</p></details> |  |

The emergence of large video foundation models has led RGB-only video backbones to outperform previous methods needing both RGB and optical flow modalities. Leveraging these large models is often limited to training only the TAL head due to the prohibitively large GPU memory required to adapt the video backbone for TAL. To overcome this limitation, we introduce LoSA, the first memory-and-parameter-efficient backbone adapter designed specifically for TAL to handle untrimmed videos. LoSA specializes for TAL by introducing Long-Short-range Adapters that adapt the intermediate layers of the video backbone over different temporal ranges. These adapters run parallel to the video backbone to significantly reduce memory footprint. LoSA also includes Long-Short-range Gated Fusion that strategically combines the output of these adapters from the video backbone layers to enhance the video features provided to the TAL head. Experiments show that LoSA significantly outperforms all existing methods on standard TAL benchmarks, THUMOS-14 and ActivityNet-v1.3, by scaling end-to-end backbone adaptation to billion-parameter-plus models like VideoMAEv2~(ViT-g) and leveraging them beyond head-only transfer learning.</p></details> | Under submission |

Our study presents a novel perspective on the interconnectedness of evolving infectious disease knowledge. Through identifying publications based on funded and unfunded research, the analysis of temporal network of infectious disease associations reveals (i) growing compartmentalisation of funded research, i.e., it focuses on the groups of infectious diseases with readily established connections, and (ii) the growth in global integration in unfunded research, i.e., it tends to be more widely exploratory and links distant diseases. Moreover, we find that in both funded and unfunded research prominent diseases like HIV, malaria and tuberculosis have strong bridging effects facilitating global integration, while diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis are characterised with strong local connectivity between themselves. We also find that although coronavirus has seen a surge in publications since COVID-19, its systemic impact on the interconnectedness of infectious disease knowledge remains relatively low. Our work highlights the importance of considering the interconnectedness of infectious diseases in health policy making and has potential to contribute to more efficient health resource allocation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Scientometrics</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Correlation Meets Embedding: Towards a 2nd Generation of JDE-based Real-Time Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14086v2)** | 2024-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint Detection and Embedding (JDE) trackers have demonstrated excellent performance in Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) tasks by incorporating the extraction of appearance features as auxiliary tasks through embedding Re-Identification task (ReID) into the detector, achieving a balance between inference speed and tracking performance. However, solving the competition between the detector and the feature extractor has always been a challenge. Meanwhile, the issue of directly embedding the ReID task into MOT has remained unresolved. The lack of high discriminability in appearance features results in their limited utility. In this paper, a new learning approach using cross-correlation to capture temporal information of objects is proposed. The feature extraction network is no longer trained solely on appearance features from each frame but learns richer motion features by utilizing feature heatmaps from consecutive frames, which addresses the challenge of inter-class feature similarity. Furthermore, our learning approach is applied to a more lightweight feature extraction network, and treat the feature matching scores as strong cues rather than auxiliary cues, with an appropriate weight calculation to reflect the compatibility between our obtained features and the MOT task. Our tracker, named TCBTrack, achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple public benchmarks, i.e., MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack datasets. Specifically, on the DanceTrack test set, we achieve 56.8 HOTA, 58.1 IDF1 and 92.5 MOTA, making it the best online tracker capable of achieving real-time performance. Comparative evaluations with other trackers prove that our tracker achieves the best balance between speed, robustness and accuracy.

Since existing methods take as input only a video segment of fixed size per iteration, they are limited in considering long-term context and require tuning the segment size carefully. To overcome these limitations, we propose memory-augmented transformer (MATR). MATR utilizes the memory queue that selectively preserves the past segment features, allowing to leverage long-term context for inference. We also propose a novel action localization method that observes the current input segment to predict the end time of the ongoing action and accesses the memory queue to estimate the start time of the action. Our method outperformed existing methods on two datasets, THUMOS14 and MUSES, surpassing not only TAL methods in the online setting but also some offline TAL methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024, Project page: https://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/research/MATR/</p></details> |

This augmented logic is known as STL*. The previous algorithms for STL* monitoring were intractable, and did not scale formulae with nested freeze variables. We present offline discrete-time monitoring algorithms with an acceleration heuristic, both for Boolean monitoring as well as for quantitative robustness monitoring. The acceleration heuristic operates over time intervals where subformulae hold true, rather than over the original trace sample-points. We present experimental validation of our algorithms, the results show that our algorithms can monitor over long traces for formulae with two or three nested freeze variables.

Temporal patterns are a natural feature of DGs and are also key to representation learning. However, existing dynamic GCN models are mostly composed of static GCNs and sequence modules, which results in the separation of spatiotemporal information and cannot effectively capture complex temporal patterns in DGs. To address this problem, this study proposes a spatial-temporal graph convolutional networks with diversified transformation (STGCNDT), which includes three aspects: a) constructing a unified graph tensor convolutional network (GTCN) using tensor M-products without the need to represent spatiotemporal information separately; b) introducing three transformation schemes in GTCN to model complex temporal patterns to aggregate temporal information; and c) constructing an ensemble of diversified transformation schemes to obtain higher representation capabilities. Empirical studies on four DGs that appear in communication networks show that the proposed STGCNDT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in solving link weight estimation tasks due to the diversified transformations.</p></details> | 8 papges, 1 figure |

The central aim of multi-agent optimization is for a network of agents to collaboratively solve a system-level optimization problem with local objective functions and node-to-node communication by distributed algorithms. The scalability of such algorithms crucially depends on the complexity of the communication messages, and a number of communication compressors for distributed optimization have recently been proposed in the literature. First of all, we introduce a general spatio-temporal compressor characterized by the stability of the resulting dynamical system along the vector field of the compressor. We show that several important distributed optimization compressors such as the greedy sparsifier, the uniform quantizer, and the scalarizer all fall into the category of this spatio-temporal compressor. Next, we propose two distributed prime-dual flows with the spatio-temporal compressors being applied to local node states and local error states, respectively, and prove (exponential) convergence of the node trajectories to the global optimizer for (strongly) convex cost functions. Finally, a few numerical examples are present to illustrate our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Gaussian Temporal Difference Error For Uncertainty-aware Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02295v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional uncertainty-aware temporal difference (TD) learning methods often rely on simplistic assumptions, typically including a zero-mean Gaussian distribution for TD errors. Such oversimplification can lead to inaccurate error representations and compromised uncertainty estimation. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for generalized Gaussian error modeling in deep reinforcement learning, applicable to both discrete and continuous control settings. Our framework enhances the flexibility of error distribution modeling by incorporating higher-order moments, particularly kurtosis, thereby improving the estimation and mitigation of data-dependent noise, i.e., aleatoric uncertainty. We examine the influence of the shape parameter of the generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) on aleatoric uncertainty and provide a closed-form expression that demonstrates an inverse relationship between uncertainty and the shape parameter. Additionally, we propose a theoretically grounded weighting scheme to fully leverage the GGD. To address epistemic uncertainty, we enhance the batch inverse variance weighting by incorporating bias reduction and kurtosis considerations, resulting in improved robustness. Extensive experimental evaluations using policy gradient algorithms demonstrate the consistent efficacy of our method, showcasing significant performance improvements.</p></details> |  |

However, in real world applications, environments constantly change due to a variety of external events. To address this problem, we study Markov Decision Processes (MDP) under the influence of an external temporal process. We formalize this notion and discuss conditions under which the problem becomes tractable with suitable solutions. We propose a policy iteration algorithm to solve this problem and theoretically analyze its performance. We derive results on the sample complexity of the algorithm and study its dependency on the extent of non-stationarity of the environment. We then conduct experiments to illustrate our results in a classic control environment.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D Single-object Tracking in Point Clouds with High Temporal Variation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02049v1)** | 2024-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The high temporal variation of the point clouds is the key challenge of 3D single-object tracking (3D SOT). Existing approaches rely on the assumption that the shape variation of the point clouds and the motion of the objects across neighboring frames are smooth, failing to cope with high temporal variation data. In this paper, we present a novel framework for 3D SOT in point clouds with high temporal variation, called HVTrack. HVTrack proposes three novel components to tackle the challenges in the high temporal variation scenario: 1) A Relative-Pose-Aware Memory module to handle temporal point cloud shape variations; 2) a Base-Expansion Feature Cross-Attention module to deal with similar object distractions in expanded search areas; 3) a Contextual Point Guided Self-Attention module for suppressing heavy background noise. We construct a dataset with high temporal variation (KITTI-HV) by setting different frame intervals for sampling in the KITTI dataset. On the KITTI-HV with 5 frame intervals, our HVTrack surpasses the state-of-the-art tracker CXTracker by 11.3%/15.7% in Success/Precision.</p></details> | Accepted by ECCV24 |

Trajectory optimisation algorithms have proved their utility in a wide variety of tasks, but, like most methods struggle scaling to the high dimensional systems ubiquitous to non-prehensile manipulation in clutter as well as deformable object manipulation. We reason that, during manipulation, different degrees of freedom will become more or less important to the task over time as the system evolves. We leverage this idea to reduce the number of degrees of freedom considered in a trajectory optimisation problem, to reduce planning times. This idea is particularly relevant in the context of model predictive control (MPC) where the cost landscape of the optimisation problem is constantly evolving. We provide simulation results under asynchronous MPC and show our methods are capable of achieving better overall performance due to the decreased policy lag whilst still being able to optimise trajectories effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures, accepted to WAFR 2024</p></details> |

This paper introduces a self-optimizing controller, Type-1 fuzzyPID, which leverages dynamic and static system response analysis to overcome the limitations of manual tuning. To account for system uncertainties, an Interval Type-2 fuzzyPID controller is also developed. Both controllers are designed using Matlab/Simulink and tested through trajectory tracking simulations in the CoppeliaSim environment. Additionally, a non-linear model predictive controller(NMPC) is proposed and compared against the fuzzyPID controllers. The impact of tunable parameters on NMPC tracking accuracy is thoroughly examined. We also present plots of the step-response characteristics and noise rejection experiments for each controller. Simulation results validate the precision and effectiveness of NMPC over fuzzyPID controllers while trading computational complexity.

To tackle this challenge, we propose a progressive 3D editing strategy that ensures multi-view consistency via a Trajectory-Anchored Scheme (TAS) with a dual-branch editing mechanism. Specifically, TAS facilitates a tightly coupled iterative process between 2D view editing and 3D updating, preventing error accumulation yielded from text-to-image process. Additionally, we explore the relationship between optimization-based methods and reconstruction-based methods, offering a unified perspective for selecting superior design choice, supporting the rationale behind the designed TAS. We further present a tuning-free View-Consistent Attention Control (VCAC) module that leverages cross-view semantic and geometric reference from the source branch to yield aligned views from the target branch during the editing of 2D views. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we analyze 2D examples to demonstrate the improved consistency with the VCAC module. Further extensive quantitative and qualitative results in text-guided 3D scene editing indicate that our method achieves superior editing quality compared to state-of-the-art methods. We will make the complete codebase publicly available following the conclusion of the review process.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods often struggle to balance resource conservation, accurate state estimation and precise tracking, resulting in suboptimal performance. This problem is particularly pronounced in environments with large action spaces, where the need for frequent, accurate state data is paramount, yet the capacity for active localization updates is restricted by external limitations. This paper introduces ComTraQ-MPC, a novel framework that combines Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) to optimize trajectory tracking with constrained active localization updates. The meta-trained DQN ensures adaptive active localization scheduling, while the MPC leverages available state information to improve tracking. The central contribution of this work is their reciprocal interaction: DQN's update decisions inform MPC's control strategy, and MPC's outcomes refine DQN's learning, creating a cohesive, adaptive system. Empirical evaluations in simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that ComTraQ-MPC significantly enhances operational efficiency and accuracy, providing a generalizable and approximately optimal solution for trajectory tracking in complex partially observable environments.</p></details> | * Equal contribution |

Understanding the importance of risk factors measured at a mental health visit can help clinicians evaluate future risk and provide appropriate care during the visit. In prediction settings where data are collected over time, such as in mental health care, it is often of interest to understand both the importance of variables for predicting the response at each time point and the importance summarized over the time series. Building on recent advances in estimation and inference for variable importance measures, we define summaries of variable importance trajectories and corresponding estimators. The same approaches for inference can be applied to these measures regardless of the choice of the algorithm(s) used to estimate the prediction function. We propose a nonparametric efficient estimation and inference procedure as well as a null hypothesis testing procedure that are valid even when complex machine learning tools are used for prediction. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed procedures have good operating characteristics. We use these approaches to analyze electronic health records data from two large health systems to investigate the longitudinal importance of risk factors for suicide attempt to inform future suicide prevention research and clinical workflow.</p></details> | <details><summary>81 pa...</summary><p>81 pages (34 main, 47 supplementary), 8 figures (4 main, 4 supplementary), 29 tables (2 main, 27 supplementary)</p></details> |
| **[DBHP: Trajectory Imputation in Multi-Agent Sports Using Derivative-Based Hybrid Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10878v1)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many spatiotemporal domains handle multi-agent trajectory data, but in real-world scenarios, collected trajectory data are often partially missing due to various reasons. While existing approaches demonstrate good performance in trajectory imputation, they face challenges in capturing the complex dynamics and interactions between agents due to a lack of physical constraints that govern realistic trajectories, leading to suboptimal results. To address this issue, the paper proposes a Derivative-Based Hybrid Prediction (DBHP) framework that can effectively impute multiple agents' missing trajectories. First, a neural network equipped with Set Transformers produces a naive prediction of missing trajectories while satisfying the permutation-equivariance in terms of the order of input agents. Then, the framework makes alternative predictions leveraging velocity and acceleration information and combines all the predictions with properly determined weights to provide final imputed trajectories. In this way, our proposed framework not only accurately predicts position, velocity, and acceleration values but also enforces the physical relationship between them, eventually improving both the accuracy and naturalness of the predicted trajectories. Accordingly, the experiment results about imputing player trajectories in team sports show that our framework significantly outperforms existing imputation baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards reliable real-time trajectory optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10731v1)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion planning is a key aspect of robotics. A common approach to address motion planning problems is trajectory optimization. Trajectory optimization can represent the high-level behaviors of robots through mathematical formulations. However, current trajectory optimization approaches have two main challenges. Firstly, their solution heavily depends on the initial guess, and they are prone to get stuck in local minima. Secondly, they face scalability limitations by increasing the number of constraints. This thesis endeavors to tackle these challenges by introducing four innovative trajectory optimization algorithms to improve reliability, scalability, and computational efficiency. There are two novel aspects of the proposed algorithms. The first key innovation is remodeling the kinematic constraints and collision avoidance constraints. Another key innovation lies in the design of algorithms that effectively utilize parallel computation on GPU accelerators. By using reformulated constraints and leveraging the computational power of GPUs, the proposed algorithms of this thesis demonstrate significant improvements in efficiency and scalability compared to the existing methods. Parallelization enables faster computation times, allowing for real-time decision-making in dynamic environments. Moreover, the algorithms are designed to adapt to changes in the environment, ensuring robust performance. Extensive benchmarking for each proposed optimizer validates their efficacy. Overall, this thesis makes a significant contribution to the field of trajectory optimization algorithms. It introduces innovative solutions that specifically address the challenges faced by existing methods. The proposed algorithms pave the way for more efficient and robust motion planning solutions in robotics by leveraging parallel computation and specific mathematical structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD T...</summary><p>PhD Thesis, University of Tartu, 2024.

Traditional automated driving systems recalculate the entire trajectory in a changing environment. Instead, a novel approach retains valid trajectory segments, minimizing the need for complete replanning and reducing changes to the original plan. This work introduces a trajectory repairing framework that calculates a feasible evasive trajectory while computing the Feasible Time-to-React (F-TTR), balancing the maintenance of the original plan with safety assurance. The framework employs a binary search algorithm to iteratively create repaired trajectories, guaranteeing both the safety and feasibility of the trajectory repairing result. In contrast to earlier approaches that separated the calculation of safety metrics from trajectory repairing, which resulted in unsuccessful plans for evasive maneuvers, our work has the anytime capability to provide both a Feasible Time-to-React and an evasive trajectory for further execution.</p></details> |  |

Previous rule-based approaches without the integration of semantic information show a limitation in both efficiency and accuracy. Semantic information, such as activity types inferred from Points of Interest (POI) data, can significantly enhance the quality of trajectory mining. However, integrating these insights is challenging, as many POIs have incomplete feature information, and current learning-based POI algorithms require the integrity of datasets to do the classification. In this paper, we introduce a novel pipeline for human travel trajectory mining. Our approach first leverages the strong inferential and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to annotate POI with activity types and then uses a Bayesian-based algorithm to infer activity for each stay point in a trajectory. In our evaluation using the OpenStreetMap (OSM) POI dataset, our approach achieves a 93.4% accuracy and a 96.1% F-1 score in POI classification, and a 91.7% accuracy with a 92.3% F-1 score in activity inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, accepted for the 27th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2024)</p></details> |

A particularly concerning threat is the vulnerability of CPS to deceptive attacks that degrade system performance while remaining undetected. This paper investigates perfectly undetectable false data injection attacks (FDIAs) targeting the trajectory tracking control of a non-holonomic mobile robot. The proposed attack method utilizes affine transformations of intercepted signals, exploiting weaknesses inherent in the partially linear dynamic properties and symmetry of the nonlinear plant. The feasibility and potential impact of these attacks are validated through experiments using a Turtlebot 3 platform, highlighting the urgent need for sophisticated detection mechanisms and resilient control strategies to safeguard CPS against such threats. Furthermore, a novel approach for detection of these attacks called the state monitoring signature function (SMSF) is introduced. An example SMSF, a carefully designed function resilient to FDIA, is shown to be able to detect the presence of a FDIA through signatures based on systems states.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 17 figures.

Existing benchmarks rely on datasets, which are biased towards more common scenarios, such as cruising, and distance-based metrics that are computed by averaging over all scenarios. Following such a regiment provides a little insight into the properties of the models both in terms of how well they can handle different scenarios and how admissible and diverse their outputs are. There exist a number of complementary metrics designed to measure the admissibility and diversity of trajectories, however, they suffer from biases, such as length of trajectories. In this paper, we propose a new benChmarking paRadIgm for evaluaTing trajEctoRy predIction Approaches (CRITERIA). Particularly, we propose 1) a method for extracting driving scenarios at varying levels of specificity according to the structure of the roads, models' performance, and data properties for fine-grained ranking of prediction models; 2) A set of new bias-free metrics for measuring diversity, by incorporating the characteristics of a given scenario, and admissibility, by considering the structure of roads and kinematic compliancy, motivated by real-world driving constraints. 3) Using the proposed benchmark, we conduct extensive experimentation on a representative set of the prediction models using the large scale Argoverse dataset. We show that the proposed benchmark can produce a more accurate ranking of the models and serve as a means of characterizing their behavior. We further present ablation studies to highlight contributions of different elements that are used to compute the proposed metrics.</p></details> |  |

The low-dimensional signals that capture internal brain states are useful for building brain machine interfaces and understanding the neural computation underlying meaningful behavior. We derive a practical upper bound to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of inferred neural latent trajectories using Fisher information. We show that the SNR bound is proportional to the overdispersion factor and the Fisher information per neuron. Further numerical experiments show that inference methods that exploit the temporal regularities can achieve higher SNRs that are proportional to the bound. Our results provide insights for fitting models to data, simulating neural responses, and design of experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article is accepted for publication in the 2024 European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)</p></details> |
| **[COTODE: COntinuous Trajectory neural Ordinary Differential Equations for modelling event sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08055v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Observation of the underlying actors that generate event sequences reveals that they often evolve continuously. Most modern methods, however, tend to model such processes through at most piecewise-continuous trajectories. To address this, we adopt a way of viewing events not as standalone phenomena but instead as observations of a Gaussian Process, which in turn governs the actor's dynamics. We propose integrating these obtained dynamics, resulting in a continuous-trajectory modification of the widely successful Neural ODE model. Through Gaussian Process theory, we were able to evaluate the uncertainty in an actor's representation, which arises from not observing them between events. This estimate led us to develop a novel, theoretically backed negative feedback mechanism. Empirical studies indicate that our model with Gaussian process interpolation and negative feedback achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improvements up to 20% AUROC against similar architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exact Trajectory Similarity Search With N-tree: An Efficient Metric Index for kNN and Range Queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07650v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Similarity search is the problem of finding in a collection of objects those that are similar to a given query object. It is a fundamental problem in modern applications and the objects considered may be as diverse as locations in space, text documents, images, twitter messages, or trajectories of moving objects. In this paper we are motivated by the latter application. Trajectories are recorded movements of mobile objects such as vehicles, animals, public transportation, or parts of the human body. We propose a novel distance function called DistanceAvg to capture the similarity of such movements. To be practical, it is necessary to provide indexing for this distance measure. Fortunately we do not need to start from scratch. A generic and unifying approach is metric space, which organizes the set of objects solely by a distance (similarity) function with certain natural properties. Our function DistanceAvg is a metric. Although metric indexes have been studied for decades and many such structures are available, they do not offer the best performance with trajectories. In this paper we propose a new design, which outperforms the best existing indexes for kNN queries and is equally good for range queries. It is especially suitable for expensive distance functions as they occur in trajectory similarity search. In many applications, kNN queries are more practical than range queries as it may be difficult to determine an appropriate search radius. Our index provides exact result sets for the given distance function.</p></details> | 54 pages, 26 figures |

Despite increasing interest, recent works face challenges in achieving aesthetically appealing choreography, primarily for two key issues: multi-dancer collision and single-dancer foot slide. To address these issues, we propose a Trajectory-Controllable Diffusion (TCDiff), a novel approach that harnesses non-overlapping trajectories to facilitate coherent dance movements. Specifically, to tackle dancer collisions, we introduce a Dance-Beat Navigator capable of generating trajectories for multiple dancers based on the music, complemented by a Distance-Consistency loss to maintain appropriate spacing among trajectories within a reasonable threshold. To mitigate foot sliding, we present a Footwork Adaptor that utilizes trajectory displacement from adjacent frames to enable flexible footwork, coupled with a Relative Forward-Kinematic loss to adjust the positioning of individual dancers' root nodes and joints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[RALTPER: A Risk-Aware Local Trajectory Planner for Complex Environment with Gaussian Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05838v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel Risk-Aware Local Trajectory Planner (RALTPER) for autonomous vehicles in complex environments characterized by Gaussian uncertainty. The proposed method integrates risk awareness and trajectory planning by leveraging probabilistic models to evaluate the likelihood of collisions with dynamic and static obstacles. The RALTPER focuses on collision avoidance constraints for both the ego vehicle region and the Gaussian-obstacle risk region. Additionally, this work enhances the generalization of both vehicle and obstacle models, making the planner adaptable to a wider range of scenarios. Our approach formulates the planning problem as a nonlinear optimization, solved using the IPOPT solver within the CasADi environment. The planner is evaluated through simulations of various challenging scenarios, including complex, static, mixed environment and narrow single-lane avoidance of pedestrians. Results demonstrate that RALTPER achieves safer and more efficient trajectory planning particularly in navigating narrow areas where a more accurate vehicle profile representation is critical for avoiding collisions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning for Teleoperated Space Manipulators Using Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05460v1)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning for teleoperated space manipulators involves challenges such as accurately modeling system dynamics, particularly in free-floating modes with non-holonomic constraints, and managing time delays that increase model uncertainty and affect control precision. Traditional teleoperation methods rely on precise dynamic models requiring complex parameter identification and calibration, while data-driven methods do not require prior knowledge but struggle with time delays. A novel framework utilizing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is introduced to address these challenges. The framework incorporates three methods: Mapping, Prediction, and State Augmentation, to handle delays when delayed state information is received at the master end. The Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm processes the state information to compute the next action, which is then sent to the remote manipulator for environmental interaction. Four environments are constructed using the MuJoCo simulation platform to account for variations in base and target fixation: fixed base and target, fixed base with rotated target, free-floating base with fixed target, and free-floating base with rotated target. Extensive experiments with both constant and random delays are conducted to evaluate the proposed methods. Results demonstrate that all three methods effectively address trajectory planning challenges, with State Augmentation showing superior efficiency and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear Propagation of Non-Gaussian Uncertainties: Theory and Applications to Spacecraft Trajectory Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05384v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel approach for propagating uncertainties in dynamical systems building on high-order Taylor expansions of the flow and moment-generating functions (MGFs). Unlike prior methods that focus on Gaussian distributions, our approach leverages the relationship between MGFs and distribution moments to extend high-order uncertainty propagation techniques to non-Gaussian scenarios. This significantly broadens the applicability of these methods to a wider range of problems and uncertainty types. High-order moment computations are performed one-off and symbolically, reducing the computational burden of the technique to the calculation of Taylor series coefficients around a nominal trajectory, achieved by efficiently integrating the system's variational equations. Furthermore, the use of the proposed approach in combination with event transition tensors, allows for accurate propagation of uncertainties at specific events, such as the landing surface of a celestial body, the crossing of a predefined Poincar\'e section, or the trigger of an arbitrary event during the propagation. Via numerical simulations we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various astrodynamics applications, including the unperturbed and perturbed two-body problem, and the circular restricted three-body problem, showing that it accurately propagates non-Gaussian uncertainties both at future times and at event manifolds.</p></details> |  |

Building on prior work, it addresses the multi-robot communication-aware trajectory planning problem using a general optimisation framework that imposes linear constraints on changes in robot positions to ensure communication performance and collision avoidance. In this paper, the optimisation problem is solved distributively by separating the communication performance constraint through an economic approach. Here, the current communication budget is distributed equally among the robots, and the robots are allowed to trade parts of their budgets with each other. The separated optimisation problem is then solved using the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers. The method was verified through simulation in an inspection task problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajCogn: Leveraging LLMs for Cognizing Movement Patterns and Travel Purposes from Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12459v2)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal trajectories are crucial in various data mining tasks. It is important to develop a versatile trajectory learning method that performs different tasks with high accuracy. This involves effectively extracting two core aspects of information--movement patterns and travel purposes--from trajectories. However, this is challenging due to limitations in model capacity and the quality and scale of trajectory datasets. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have shown great success in versatility by training on large-scale, high-quality datasets. Given the similarities between trajectories and sentences, there's potential to leverage LLMs to develop an effective trajectory learning method. However, standard LLMs are not designed to handle the unique spatio-temporal features of trajectories and cannot extract movement patterns and travel purposes. To address these challenges, we propose a model called TrajCogn that effectively utilizes LLMs to model trajectories. TrajCogn leverages the strengths of LLMs to create a versatile trajectory learning approach while addressing the limitations of standard LLMs. First, TrajCogn incorporates a novel trajectory semantic embedder that enables LLMs to process spatio-temporal features and extract movement patterns and travel purposes. Second, TrajCogn introduces a new trajectory prompt that integrates these patterns and purposes into LLMs, allowing the model to adapt to various tasks. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and two representative tasks demonstrate that TrajCogn successfully achieves its design goals.

| **[PTrajM: Efficient and Semantic-rich Trajectory Learning with Pretrained Trajectory-Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04916v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle trajectories provide crucial movement information for various real-world applications. To better utilize vehicle trajectories, it is essential to develop a trajectory learning approach that can effectively and efficiently extract rich semantic information, including movement behavior and travel purposes, to support accurate downstream applications. However, creating such an approach presents two significant challenges. First, movement behavior are inherently spatio-temporally continuous, making them difficult to extract efficiently from irregular and discrete trajectory points. Second, travel purposes are related to the functionalities of areas and road segments traversed by vehicles. These functionalities are not available from the raw spatio-temporal trajectory features and are hard to extract directly from complex textual features associated with these areas and road segments. To address these challenges, we propose PTrajM, a novel method capable of efficient and semantic-rich vehicle trajectory learning. To support efficient modeling of movement behavior, we introduce Trajectory-Mamba as the learnable model of PTrajM, which effectively extracts continuous movement behavior while being more computationally efficient than existing structures. To facilitate efficient extraction of travel purposes, we propose a travel purpose-aware pre-training procedure, which enables PTrajM to discern the travel purposes of trajectories without additional computational resources during its embedding process. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and comparisons with several state-of-the-art trajectory learning methods demonstrate the effectiveness of PTrajM.

Two phonological feature sets, based respectively on generative and articulatory phonology, are used to encode a phonetic target sequence. Different interpolation techniques are compared to generate smooth trajectories in these feature spaces, with a potential optimisation of the target value and timing to capture co-articulation effects. We report the Pearson correlation between a linear projection of the generated trajectories and articulatory data derived from a multi-speaker dataset of electromagnetic articulography (EMA) recordings. A correlation of 0.67 is obtained with an extended feature set based on generative phonology and a linear interpolation technique.

We aim to learn temporal latent representations of the underlying generative process that explain the observed patient disease trajectories in an interpretable and comprehensive way. To enhance the interpretability of these latent temporal processes, we develop a semi-supervised approach for disentangling the latent space using established medical knowledge. By combining the generative approach with medical definitions of different characteristics of SSc, we facilitate the discovery of new aspects of the disease. We show that the learned temporal latent processes can be utilized for further data analysis and clinical hypothesis testing, including finding similar patients and clustering SSc patient trajectories into novel sub-types. Moreover, our method enables personalized online monitoring and prediction of multivariate time series with uncertainty quantification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Machine Learning for Healthcare 2024. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2311.08149</p></details> |
| **[Grasping Trajectory Optimization with Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05466v2)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new trajectory optimization method for robotic grasping based on a point-cloud representation of robots and task spaces. In our method, robots are represented by 3D points on their link surfaces. The task space of a robot is represented by a point cloud that can be obtained from depth sensors. Using the point-cloud representation, goal reaching in grasping can be formulated as point matching, while collision avoidance can be efficiently achieved by querying the signed distance values of the robot points in the signed distance field of the scene points. Consequently, a constrained nonlinear optimization problem is formulated to solve the joint motion and grasp planning problem. The advantage of our method is that the point-cloud representation is general to be used with any robot in any environment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by performing experiments on a tabletop scene and a shelf scene for grasping with a Fetch mobile manipulator and a Franka Panda arm.

While these questions can be studied by employing multiple datasets, it is challenging due to several discrepancies, e.g., in data formats, map resolution, and semantic annotation types. To address these challenges, we introduce UniTraj, a comprehensive framework that unifies various datasets, models, and evaluation criteria, presenting new opportunities for the vehicle trajectory prediction field. In particular, using UniTraj, we conduct extensive experiments and find that model performance significantly drops when transferred to other datasets. However, enlarging data size and diversity can substantially improve performance, leading to a new state-of-the-art result for the nuScenes dataset. We provide insights into dataset characteristics to explain these findings.

Our goal is to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating in crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We use VLMs and a visual prompting approach with their zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our methods in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe at least 3.35% improvement in traversability and 20.61% improvement in terms of human-like navigation in generated trajectories in challenging outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pose-Aware Self-Supervised Learning with Viewpoint Trajectory Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14973v2)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning visual features from unlabeled images has proven successful for semantic categorization, often by mapping different $views$ of the same object to the same feature to achieve recognition invariance. However, visual recognition involves not only identifying $what$ an object is but also understanding $how$ it is presented. For example, seeing a car from the side versus head-on is crucial for deciding whether to stay put or jump out of the way. While unsupervised feature learning for downstream viewpoint reasoning is important, it remains under-explored, partly due to the lack of a standardized evaluation method and benchmarks. We introduce a new dataset of adjacent image triplets obtained from a viewpoint trajectory, without any semantic or pose labels. We benchmark both semantic classification and pose estimation accuracies on the same visual feature. Additionally, we propose a viewpoint trajectory regularization loss for learning features from unlabeled image triplets. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach helps develop a visual representation that encodes object identity and organizes objects by their poses, retaining semantic classification accuracy while achieving emergent global pose awareness and better generalization to novel objects.

Learning-based methods are currently showing impressive results in simulation-based challenges, with transformer-based architectures technologically leading the way. Ultimately, however, predictions are needed in the real world. In addition to the shifts from simulation to the real world, many vehicle- and country-specific shifts, i.e. differences in sensor systems, fusion and perception algorithms as well as traffic rules and laws, are on the agenda. Since models that can cover all system setups and design domains at once are not yet foreseeable, model adaptation plays a central role. Therefore, a simulation-based study on transfer learning techniques is conducted on basis of a transformer-based model. Furthermore, the study aims to provide insights into possible trade-offs between computational time and performance to support effective transfers into the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), Jeju Shinhwa World, Jeju Island, Korea, June 2-5, 2024</p></details> |

Such a robot needs to be able to constantly adapt to the surrounding scene based on egocentric vision, and predict the ego motion of the wearer. In this work, we leveraged body-mounted cameras and sensors to anticipate the trajectory of human wearers through complex surroundings. To facilitate research in ego-motion prediction, we have collected a comprehensive walking scene navigation dataset centered on the user's perspective. We then present a method to predict human motion conditioning on the surrounding static scene. Our method leverages a diffusion model to produce a distribution of potential future trajectories, taking into account the user's observation of the environment. To that end, we introduce a compact representation to encode the user's visual memory of the surroundings, as well as an efficient sample-generating technique to speed up real-time inference of a diffusion model. We ablate our model and compare it to baselines, and results show that our model outperforms existing methods on key metrics of collision avoidance and trajectory mode coverage.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

In this work, we introduce Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Demonstration Imitation (STODI), a trajectory optimization framework for robots to imitate the shape of demonstration trajectories with improved dynamic performance. Consistent with the human learning process, demonstration imitation serves as an initial step, while trajectory optimization aims to enhance robot motion performance. By generating random noise and constructing proper cost functions, the STODI effectively explores and exploits generated noisy trajectories while preserving the demonstration shape characteristics. We employ three metrics to measure the similarity of trajectories in both the time and frequency domains to help with demonstration imitation. Theoretical analysis reveals relationships among these metrics, emphasizing the benefits of frequency-domain analysis for specific tasks. Experiments on a 7-DOF robotic arm in the PyBullet simulator validate the efficacy of the STODI framework, showcasing the improved optimization performance and stability compared to previous methods.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a holistic framework that jointly optimizes the total latency and energy consumption for UAV-assisted fog computing in a three-dimensional spatial domain with varying terrain elevations and dynamic task generations. Our proposed framework considers three important and interdependent modules: attitude control, trajectory planning, and task assignment. We first establish a fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative control model to determine the UAV's attitude. Then, we propose an enhanced Ant Colony System (ACS) based algorithm, that includes a safety value and a decoupling mechanism to overcome the convergence issue in classical ACS, to compute the optimal UAV trajectory. Finally, we design an algorithm based on the Particle Swarm Optimization technique, to determine where each offloaded task should be executed. Under our proposed framework, the outcome of one module would affect the decision-making in one other, providing a holistic perspective of the system and thus leading to improved solutions. We demonstrate by extensive simulation results that our proposed framework can significantly improve the overall performance, measured by latency and energy consumption, compared to existing baseline approaches.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

Such manoeuvring flight envelope variations, governed by the aircraft's complex nonlinear dynamics, are unpredictable by pilots and existing flight management systems. To prevent in-flight Loss of Control, post-failure trajectories must be optimal, planned in real-time, avoid terrain, and adhere to the impaired aircraft's reduced manoeuvrability and dynamic constraints. This paper presents a novel real-time trajectory optimization method for impaired aircraft based on a combination of differential flatness theory, the pseudospectral method, nonlinear programming, and inverse dynamics. In the proposed method, which utilizes a high-fidelity nonlinear six degree-of-freedom model, to conform to aircraft's altered dynamics a sequence of trim points is selected from the impaired aircraft's manoeuvring flight envelope based on the chosen optimization criteria, ensuring that the resulting three-dimensional trajectory observes terrain avoidance. Then, the required control inputs are obtained for each manoeuvre in less than a second. The method is applied to the NASA Generic Transport Model with rudder failure near a complex mountainous terrain. Both an optimal one-piece trajectory and a near-optimal piecewise path consisting of several optimal trajectories, are generated in non-real-time and real-time, respectively, and compared. Results show that the near-optimal real-time trajectory retains up to 80% of the optimality.</p></details> | <details><summary>56 pa...</summary><p>56 pages, 21 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Existing motion prediction approaches have ample room for improvement, particularly in terms of long-term prediction accuracy and interpretability. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing LC-LLM, an explainable lane change prediction model that leverages the strong reasoning capabilities and self-explanation abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Essentially, we reformulate the lane change prediction task as a language modeling problem, processing heterogeneous driving scenario information as natural language prompts for LLMs and employing supervised fine-tuning to tailor LLMs specifically for lane change prediction task. Additionally, we finetune the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve prediction transparency and reliability, and include explanatory requirements in the prompts during inference stage. Therefore, our LC-LLM model not only predicts lane change intentions and trajectories but also provides CoT reasoning and explanations for its predictions, enhancing its interpretability. Extensive experiments based on the large-scale highD dataset demonstrate the superior performance and interpretability of our LC-LLM in lane change prediction task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize LLMs for predicting lane change behavior. Our study shows that LLMs can effectively encode comprehensive interaction information for driving behavior understanding.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

Due to a large amount of variability in brain anatomy between different individuals, we hypothesize that leveraging MRI time series can help improve specificity, by treating each patient as their own baseline. Here we turn to conditional variational autoencoders to generate individualized MRI predictions given the subject's age, disease status and one previous scan. Using serial imaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we train a novel architecture to build a latent space distribution which can be sampled from to generate future predictions of changing anatomy. This enables us to extrapolate beyond the dataset and predict MRIs up to 10 years. We evaluated the model on a held-out set from ADNI and an independent dataset (from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies). By comparing to several alternatives, we show that our model produces more individualized images with higher resolution. Further, if an individual already has a follow-up MRI, we demonstrate a usage of our model to compute a likelihood ratio classifier for disease status. In practice, the model may be able to assist in early diagnosis of AD and provide a counterfactual baseline trajectory for treatment effect estimation. Furthermore, it generates a synthetic dataset that can potentially be used for downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI 2024 LDTM workshop</p></details> |

In particular, the tasks of different types and service requirements in MEC network are offloaded from one UAV to another. To pursue the goal of low-carbon edge computing, we study the problem of minimizing system energy consumption by jointly optimizing computation resource allocation, task scheduling, service placement, and UAV trajectories. Considering the inherent unpredictability associated with task generation and the dynamic nature of wireless fading channels, addressing this problem presents a significant challenge. To overcome this issue, we reformulate the complicated non-convex problem as a Markov decision process and propose a soft actor-critic-based trajectory optimization and resource allocation algorithm to implement a flexible learning strategy. Numerical results illustrate that within a multi-UAV-enabled MEC network, the proposed algorithm effectively reduces the system energy consumption in heterogeneous tasks and services scenarios compared to other baseline solutions.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Incorporating Control Inputs in the Estimation of Continuous Mobile Robot Trajectories and Continuum Robot Shapes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01333v1)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous-time batch state estimation using Gaussian processes is an efficient approach to estimate the trajectories of robots over time. In the past, relatively simple physics-motivated priors have been considered for such approaches, using assumptions such as constant velocity or acceleration. This paper presents an approach to incorporating exogenous control inputs, such as velocity or acceleration commands, into the continuous Gaussian process state-estimation framework. It is shown that this approach generalizes across different domains in robotics, making it applicable to both the estimation of continuous-time trajectories for mobile robots and continuum-robot shapes. Results show that incorporating control inputs leads to more informed priors, potentially requiring less measurements and estimation nodes to obtain accurate estimates. This makes the approach particularly useful in situations in which limited sensing is available.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

In this study, we focus on a scenario where a connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) serves as the central agent, utilizing both sensors and communication technologies to perceive its surrounding traffics consisting of autonomous vehicles (AVs), connected vehicles (CVs), and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Our trajectory prediction task is aimed at all the detected surrounding vehicles. To effectively integrate the multi-source data from both sensor and communication technologies, we propose a deep learning framework called MSMA utilizing a cross-attention module for multi-source data fusion. Vector map data is utilized to provide contextual information. The trajectory dataset is collected in CARLA simulator with synthesized data errors introduced. Numerical experiments demonstrate that in a mixed traffic flow scenario, the integration of data from different sources enhances our understanding of the environment. This notably improves trajectory prediction accuracy, particularly in situations with a high CV market penetration rate. The code is available at: https://github.com/xichennn/MSMA.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid advancement in connected technologies, such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, valuable information from alternate views becomes accessible via wireless networks. The integration of information from alternative views has the potential to overcome the inherent limitations associated with a single viewpoint, such as occlusions and limited field of view. In this work, we introduce V2INet, a novel trajectory prediction framework designed to model multi-view data by extending existing single-view models. Unlike previous approaches where the multi-view data is manually fused or formulated as a separate training stage, our model supports end-to-end training, enhancing both flexibility and performance. Moreover, the predicted multimodal trajectories are calibrated by a post-hoc conformal prediction module to get valid and efficient confidence regions. We evaluated the entire framework using the real-world V2I dataset V2X-Seq. Our results demonstrate superior performance in terms of Final Displacement Error (FDE) and Miss Rate (MR) using a single GPU.

However, the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) are based on supervised deep learning - which leads to challenges when the distribution of trajectories changes due to such a shock. We provide a neuro-symbolic rule-based framework to conduct error correction and detection of these models to integrate into our movement trajectory platform. We provide a suite of experiments on several recent SOTA models where we show highly accurate error detection, the ability to improve accuracy with a changing test distribution, and accuracy improvement for the base use case in addition to a suite of theoretical properties that informed algorithm development. Specifically, we show an F1 scores for predicting errors of up to 0.984, significant performance increase for out-of distribution accuracy (8.51% improvement over SOTA for zero-shot accuracy), and accuracy improvement over the SOTA model.</p></details> |  |

To tackle these challenges, we introduce Optimal Gaussian Diffusion (OGD) and Estimated Clean Manifold (ECM) Guidance. OGD optimizes the prior distribution for a small diffusion time $T$ and starts the reverse diffusion process from it. ECM directly injects guidance gradients to the estimated clean manifold, eliminating extensive gradient backpropagation throughout the network. Our methodology streamlines the generative process, enabling practical applications with reduced computational overhead. Experimental validation on the large-scale Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrates our approach's superior performance, offering a viable solution for computationally efficient, high-quality joint trajectory prediction and controllable generation for autonomous driving.

In this process, the complexity of algorithms used for vehicle control has grown significantly. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a prominent example, which has gained enormous popularity and is now widely used for vehicle motion planning and control. However, safety concerns constrain its practical application, especially since traditional procedures of functional safety (FS), with its universal standard ISO26262, reach their limits. Concomitantly, the new aspect of safety-of-the-intended-function (SOTIF) has moved into the center of attention, whose standard, ISO21448, has only been released in 2022. Thus, experience with SOTIF is low and few case studies are available in industry and research. Hence this paper aims to make two main contributions: (1) an analysis of the SOTIF for a generic MPC-based trajectory planner and (2) an interpretation and concrete application of the generic procedures described in ISO21448 for determining functional insufficiencies (FIs) and triggering conditions (TCs). Particular novelties of the paper include an approach for the out-of-context development of SOTIF-related elements (SOTIF-EooC), a compilation of important FIs and TCs for a MPC-based trajectory planner, and an optimized safety concept based on the identified FIs and TCs for the MPC-based trajectory planner.</p></details> | Extended Version |

We propose an expression exploration framework based on deep symbolic regression (DSR) integrated with a variable intersection selection (VIS) method to find variable combinations that encourage interpretable and parsimonious mathematical expressions. In the exploration learning process, two penalty terms are added to improve the reward function: (i) a complexity penalty to regulate the complexity of the explored expressions to be parsimonious, and (ii) a variable interaction penalty to encourage the expression exploration to focus on variable combinations that can best describe the data. We show the performance of the proposed method to learn several car-following dynamics models and discuss its limitations and future research directions.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, the potential of transformer-based diffusion models for effectively generating videos with controllable motion remains an area of limited exploration. This paper introduces Tora, the first trajectory-oriented DiT framework that integrates textual, visual, and trajectory conditions concurrently for video generation. Specifically, Tora consists of a Trajectory Extractor~(TE), a Spatial-Temporal DiT, and a Motion-guidance Fuser~(MGF). The TE encodes arbitrary trajectories into hierarchical spacetime motion patches with a 3D video compression network. The MGF integrates the motion patches into the DiT blocks to generate consistent videos following trajectories. Our design aligns seamlessly with DiT's scalability, allowing precise control of video content's dynamics with diverse durations, aspect ratios, and resolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate Tora's excellence in achieving high motion fidelity, while also meticulously simulating the movement of the physical world.

Learning-based approaches for multi-agent trajectory prediction, such as primarily relying on graph neural networks, graph transformers, and hypergraph neural networks, have demonstrated outstanding performance on real-world datasets in recent years. However, the hypergraph transformer-based method for trajectory prediction is yet to be explored. Therefore, we present a MultiscAle Relational Transformer (MART) network for multi-agent trajectory prediction. MART is a hypergraph transformer architecture to consider individual and group behaviors in transformer machinery. The core module of MART is the encoder, which comprises a Pair-wise Relational Transformer (PRT) and a Hyper Relational Transformer (HRT). The encoder extends the capabilities of a relational transformer by introducing HRT, which integrates hyperedge features into the transformer mechanism, promoting attention weights to focus on group-wise relations. In addition, we propose an Adaptive Group Estimator (AGE) designed to infer complex group relations in real-world environments. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets (NBA, SDD, and ETH-UCY) demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, enhancing ADE/FDE by 3.9%/11.8% on the NBA dataset.

Due to the intractable growth of non-convex constraints with the number of agents, exploring various homotopy classes that imply different convex domains, is crucial for finding a feasible solution. However, existing methods struggle to explore various homotopy classes efficiently due to combining it with time-consuming precise trajectory solution finding. CSDO, addresses this limitation by separating them into different levels and integrating an efficient Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithm to search homotopy classes. It first searches for a coarse initial guess using a large search step, identifying a specific homotopy class. Subsequent decentralized Quadratic Programming (QP) refinement processes this guess, resolving minor collisions efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that CSDO outperforms existing MVTP algorithms in large-scale, high-density scenarios, achieving up to 95% success rate in 50m $\times$ 50m random scenarios around one second.

We introduce the Enhanced Transformer for Health Outcome Simulation (ETHOS), a novel application of the transformer deep-learning architecture for analyzing high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and episodic health data. ETHOS is trained using Patient Health Timelines (PHTs)-detailed, tokenized records of health events-to predict future health trajectories, leveraging a zero-shot learning approach. ETHOS represents a significant advancement in foundation model development for healthcare analytics, eliminating the need for labeled data and model fine-tuning. Its ability to simulate various treatment pathways and consider patient-specific factors positions ETHOS as a tool for care optimization and addressing biases in healthcare delivery. Future developments will expand ETHOS' capabilities to incorporate a wider range of data types and data sources. Our work demonstrates a pathway toward accelerated AI development and deployment in healthcare.</p></details> |  |

Forward application of the model yields so called imagined trajectories (sequences of action, predicted state-reward) used to optimize the set of candidate actions that maximize expected reward. The outcome, an ideal imagined trajectory or plan, is imperfect and typically MBRL relies on model predictive control (MPC) to overcome this by continuously re-planning from scratch, incurring thus major computational cost and increasing complexity in tasks with longer receding horizon. We propose uncertainty estimation methods for online evaluation of imagined trajectories to assess whether further planned actions can be trusted to deliver acceptable reward. These methods include comparing the error after performing the last action with the standard expected error and using model uncertainty to assess the deviation from expected outcomes. Additionally, we introduce methods that exploit the forward propagation of the dynamics model to evaluate if the remainder of the plan aligns with expected results and assess the remainder of the plan in terms of the expected reward. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed uncertainty estimation methods by applying them to avoid unnecessary trajectory replanning in a shooting MBRL setting. Results highlight significant reduction on computational costs without sacrificing performance.</p></details> |  |

Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC)-based planners provide non-conservative planning, but do not rule out a (small) probability of collision. We propose a control scheme that yields an efficient trajectory based on SMPC when the traffic scenario allows, still avoiding that the vehicle causes collisions with traffic participants if the latter move according to the prediction assumptions. If some traffic participant does not behave as anticipated, no safety guarantee can be given. Then, our approach yields a trajectory which minimizes the probability of collision, using Constraint Violation Probability Minimization techniques. Our algorithm can also be adapted to minimize the anticipated harm caused by a collision. We provide a thorough discussion of the benefits of our novel control scheme and compare it to a previous approach through numerical simulations from the CommonRoad database.</p></details> |  |

However, efficiently capturing the true trajectory distribution with a compact set is challenging. In this work, we propose a novel approach for generating scene-specific trajectory sets that better represent the diversity and admissibility of future actor behavior. Our method constructs multiple trajectory sets tailored to different scene contexts, such as intersections and non-intersections, by leveraging map information and actor dynamics. We introduce a deterministic goal sampling algorithm that identifies relevant map regions and generates trajectories conditioned on the scene layout. Furthermore, we empirically investigate various sampling strategies and set sizes to optimize the trade-off between coverage and diversity. Experiments on the Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrate that our scene-specific sets achieve higher plausibility while maintaining diversity compared to traditional single-set approaches. The proposed Recursive In-Distribution Subsampling (RIDS) method effectively condenses the representation space and outperforms metric-driven sampling in terms of trajectory admissibility. Our work highlights the benefits of scene-aware trajectory set generation for capturing the complex and heterogeneous nature of actor behavior in real-world driving scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Aircraft Trajectory Segmentation-based Contrastive Coding (ATSCC), a novel self-supervised time series representation learning framework designed to capture semantic information in air traffic trajectory data. The framework leverages the segmentable characteristic of trajectories and ensures consistency within the self-assigned segments. Intensive experiments were conducted on datasets from three different airports, totaling four datasets, comparing the learned representation's performance of downstream classification and clustering with other state-of-the-art representation learning techniques. The results show that ATSCC outperforms these methods by aligning with the labels defined by aeronautical procedures. ATSCC is adaptable to various airport configurations and scalable to incomplete trajectories. This research has expanded upon existing capabilities, achieving these improvements independently without predefined inputs such as airport configurations, maneuvering procedures, or labeled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures.

Typical stochastic mobility models, e.g., random waypoint model and Gauss Markov model, can hardly capture the distribution characteristics of users within real-world areas. State-of-the-art trace-based mobility models and existing learning-based trajectory generation methods, however, are frequently constrained by the inaccessibility of substantial real trajectories due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we harness the intrinsic correlation between street maps and trajectories and develop a novel zero-shot trajectory generation method, named Map2Traj, by exploiting the diffusion model. We incorporate street maps as a condition to consistently pilot the denoising process and train our model on diverse sets of real trajectories from various regions in Xi'an, China, and their corresponding street maps. With solely the street map of an unobserved area, Map2Traj generates synthetic trajectories that not only closely resemble the real-world mobility pattern but also offer comparable efficacy. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our proposed method on zero-shot trajectory generation tasks in terms of both trajectory and distribution similarities. In addition, a case study of employing Map2Traj in wireless network optimization is presented to validate its efficacy for downstream applications.</p></details> |  |

SAPI uses an abstract way to represent and encode surrounding environment by utilizing information from real-time map, right-of-way, and surrounding traffic. The proposed model consists of two convolutional network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN)-based encoders and one decoder. A refiner is proposed to conduct a look-back operation inside the model, in order to make full use of raw history trajectory information. We evaluate SAPI on a proprietary dataset collected in real-world intersections through autonomous vehicles. It is demonstrated that SAPI shows promising performance when predicting vehicle trajectories at intersection, and outperforms benchmark methods. The average displacement error(ADE) and final displacement error(FDE) for 6-second prediction are 1.84m and 4.32m respectively. We also show that the proposed model can accurately predict vehicle trajectories in different scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Recent manifold learning-based methods have partially addressed the dimensionality and dataset size issues, but struggle with the complex text-conditional distribution. In this paper we propose a text-based trajectory generation model that attempts to address all three challenges while relying on only a handful of demonstration trajectory data. Our key idea is to leverage recent flow-based models capable of capturing complex conditional distributions, not directly in the high-dimensional trajectory space, but rather in the low-dimensional latent coordinate space of the motion manifold, with deliberately designed regularization terms to ensure smoothness of motions and robustness to text variations. We show that our {\it Motion Manifold Flow Primitive (MMFP)} framework can accurately generate qualitatively distinct motions for a wide range of text inputs, significantly outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, under review</p></details> |

Traditional methods usually perform holistic inference on the trajectories of agents, neglecting the differences in prediction difficulty among agents. This paper proposes a novel Difficulty-Guided Feature Enhancement Network (DGFNet), which leverages the prediction difficulty differences among agents for multi-agent trajectory prediction. Firstly, we employ spatio-temporal feature encoding and interaction to capture rich spatio-temporal features. Secondly, a difficulty-guided decoder is used to control the flow of future trajectories into subsequent modules, obtaining reliable future trajectories. Then, feature interaction and fusion are performed through the future feature interaction module. Finally, the fused agent features are fed into the final predictor to generate the predicted trajectory distributions for multiple participants. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Argoverse 1\&2 motion forecasting benchmarks. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each module. Moreover, compared with SOTA methods, our method balances trajectory prediction accuracy and real-time inference speed.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, with the increasing granularity and complexity of vehicle-generated data, the lack of data quality audits raises concerns about multi-party mistrust in trajectory prediction tasks. In response, this paper proposes an asynchronous federated learning data sharing method based on an interpretable reputation quantization mechanism utilizing graph neural network tools. Data providers share data structures under differential privacy constraints to ensure security while reducing redundant data. We implement deep reinforcement learning to categorize vehicles by reputation level, which optimizes the aggregation efficiency of federated learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed data sharing scheme not only reinforces the security of the trajectory prediction task but also enhances prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Human trajectory prediction is a noisy process, and no prediction does precisely match any future trajectory. It is therefore approached as a stochastic problem, where the goal is to minimise the error between the true and the predicted trajectory. In this work, we explore the application of metamorphic testing for human trajectory prediction. Metamorphic testing is designed to handle unclear or missing test oracles. It is well-designed for human trajectory prediction, where there is no clear criterion of correct or incorrect human behaviour. Metamorphic relations rely on transformations over source test cases and exploit invariants. A setting well-designed for human trajectory prediction where there are many symmetries of expected human behaviour under variations of the input, e.g. mirroring and rescaling of the input data. We discuss how metamorphic testing can be applied to stochastic human trajectory prediction and introduce the Wasserstein Violation Criterion to statistically assess whether a follow-up test case violates a label-preserving metamorphic relation.</p></details> | <details><summary>MET'2...</summary><p>MET'24: 9th ACM International Workshop on Metamorphic Testing</p></details> |

If the opposing vehicles do not react to the ego vehicle, they can be predicted accurately. However, if there is interaction between the vehicles, the prediction loses its validity. For high interaction, instead of a planning approach that reacts exclusively to the fixed prediction, a trajectory planning approach is required that incorporates the interaction with the opposing vehicles. This paper demonstrates the limitations of a widely used conventional sampling-based approach within a highly interactive blocking scenario. We show that high success rates are achieved for less aggressive blocking behavior but that the collision rate increases with more significant interaction. We further propose a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based trajectory planning approach for racing that explicitly exploits the interaction with the opposing vehicle without requiring a prediction. In contrast to the conventional approach, the RL-based approach achieves high success rates even for aggressive blocking behavior. Furthermore, we propose a novel safety layer (SL) that intervenes when the trajectory generated by the RL-based approach is infeasible. In that event, the SL generates a sub-optimal but feasible trajectory, avoiding termination of the scenario due to a not found valid solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, accepted to be published at the 27th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems, September 24 - 27, 2024, Edmonton, Canada</p></details> |
| **[Sampling-Based Hierarchical Trajectory Planning for Formation Flight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17392v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formation flight of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) poses significant challenges in terms of safety and formation keeping, particularly in cluttered environments. However, existing methods often struggle to simultaneously satisfy these two critical requirements. To address this issue, this paper proposes a sampling-based trajectory planning method with a hierarchical structure for formation flight in dense obstacle environments. To ensure reliable local sensing information sharing among UAVs, each UAV generates a safe flight corridor (SFC), which is transmitted to the leader UAV. Subsequently, a sampling-based formation guidance path generation method is designed as the front-end strategy, steering the formation to fly in the desired shape safely with the formation connectivity provided by the SFCs. Furthermore, a model predictive path integral (MPPI) based distributed trajectory optimization method is developed as the back-end part, which ensures the smoothness, safety and dynamics feasibility of the executable trajectory. To validate the efficiency of the developed algorithm, comprehensive simulation comparisons are conducted.

However, measuring real-world detouring behavior is challenging due to the need to track the movement of individual vehicles. Recent developments in high-resolution vehicle trajectory data have enabled transportation professionals to observe real-world detouring behaviors without the need to install and maintain hardware such as license plate reading cameras. This paper investigates the feasibility of vehicle probe trajectory data to capture commercial motor vehicle (CMV) detouring behavior under three unique case studies. Before doing so, a validation analysis was conducted to investigate the ability of CMV probe trajectory data to represent overall CMV volumes at well-calibrated count stations near virtual weigh stations (VWS) in Maryland. The validation analysis showed strong positive correlations (above 0.75) at all VWS stations. Upon validating the data, a methodology was applied to assess CMV detour behaviors associated with CMV enforcement activities, congestion avoidance, and incident induced temporary road closures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting 2024.

Existing methods often focus solely on either language or full trajectory control, lacking precision in synthesizing motions aligned with user-specified trajectories, especially for multi-joint control. To address these issues, we present TLControl, a novel method for realistic human motion synthesis, incorporating both low-level Trajectory and high-level Language semantics controls, through the integration of neural-based and optimization-based techniques. Specifically, we begin with training a VQ-VAE for a compact and well-structured latent motion space organized by body parts. We then propose a Masked Trajectories Transformer (MTT) for predicting a motion distribution conditioned on language and trajectory. Once trained, we use MTT to sample initial motion predictions given user-specified partial trajectories and text descriptions as conditioning. Finally, we introduce a test-time optimization to refine these coarse predictions for precise trajectory control, which offers flexibility by allowing users to specify various optimization goals and ensures high runtime efficiency. Comprehensive experiments show that TLControl significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in trajectory accuracy and time efficiency, making it practical for interactive and high-quality animation generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reacting on human stubbornness in human-machine trajectory planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17275v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, a method for a cooperative trajectory planning between a human and an automation is extended by a behavioral model of the human. This model can characterize the stubbornness of the human, which measures how strong the human adheres to his preferred trajectory. Accordingly, a static model is introduced indicating a link between the force in haptically coupled human-robot interactions and humans's stubbornness. The introduced stubbornness parameter enables an application-independent reaction of the automation for the cooperative trajectory planning. Simulation results in the context of human-machine cooperation in a care application show that the proposed behavioral model can quantitatively estimate the stubbornness of the interacting human, enabling a more targeted adaptation of the automation to the human behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-aware Multi-task Learning for Pedestrian Intent and Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17162v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of socially-aware autonomous vehicles hinges on precise modeling of human behavior. Within this broad paradigm, the specific challenge lies in accurately predicting pedestrian's trajectory and intention. Traditional methodologies have leaned heavily on historical trajectory data, frequently overlooking vital contextual cues such as pedestrian-specific traits and environmental factors. Furthermore, there's a notable knowledge gap as trajectory and intention prediction have largely been approached as separate problems, despite their mutual dependence. To bridge this gap, we introduce PTINet (Pedestrian Trajectory and Intention Prediction Network), which jointly learns the trajectory and intention prediction by combining past trajectory observations, local contextual features (individual pedestrian behaviors), and global features (signs, markings etc.). The efficacy of our approach is evaluated on widely used public datasets: JAAD and PIE, where it has demonstrated superior performance over existing state-of-the-art models in trajectory and intention prediction. The results from our experiments and ablation studies robustly validate PTINet's effectiveness in jointly exploring intention and trajectory prediction for pedestrian behaviour modelling. The experimental evaluation indicates the advantage of using global and local contextual features for pedestrian trajectory and intention prediction. The effectiveness of PTINet in predicting pedestrian behavior paves the way for the development of automated systems capable of seamlessly interacting with pedestrians in urban settings.</p></details> |  |

Although the specifications for transmitting and receiving AIS messages are fixed, it is well known that technical inaccuracies and lacking seafarer compliance lead to severe data quality impairment.

| **[Simultaneous Trajectory Optimization and Contact Selection for Contact-rich Manipulation with High-Fidelity Geometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16976v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contact-implicit trajectory optimization (CITO) is an effective method to plan complex trajectories for various contact-rich systems including manipulation and locomotion. CITO formulates a mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC) that enforces that contact forces must be zero when points are not in contact. However, MPCC solve times increase steeply with the number of allowable points of contact, which limits CITO's applicability to problems in which only a few, simple geometries are allowed to make contact. This paper introduces simultaneous trajectory optimization and contact selection (STOCS), as an extension of CITO that overcomes this limitation. The innovation of STOCS is to identify salient contact points and times inside the iterative trajectory optimization process. This effectively reduces the number of variables and constraints in each MPCC invocation. The STOCS framework, instantiated with key contact identification subroutines, renders the optimization of manipulation trajectories computationally tractable even for high-fidelity geometries consisting of tens of thousands of vertices.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2306.06465</p></details> |
| **[Synthetic Trajectory Generation Through Convolutional Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16938v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Location trajectories provide valuable insights for applications from urban planning to pandemic control. However, mobility data can also reveal sensitive information about individuals, such as political opinions, religious beliefs, or sexual orientations. Existing privacy-preserving approaches for publishing this data face a significant utility-privacy trade-off. Releasing synthetic trajectory data generated through deep learning offers a promising solution. Due to the trajectories' sequential nature, most existing models are based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, research in generative adversarial networks (GANs) largely employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image generation. This discrepancy raises the question of whether advances in computer vision can be applied to trajectory generation. In this work, we introduce a Reversible Trajectory-to-CNN Transformation (RTCT) that adapts trajectories into a format suitable for CNN-based models. We integrated this transformation with the well-known DCGAN in a proof-of-concept (PoC) and evaluated its performance against an RNN-based trajectory GAN using four metrics across two datasets. The PoC was superior in capturing spatial distributions compared to the RNN model but had difficulty replicating sequential and temporal properties. Although the PoC's utility is not sufficient for practical applications, the results demonstrate the transformation's potential to facilitate the use of CNNs for trajectory generation, opening up avenues for future research.

The approach uses deep neural networks to learn uncertain dynamics while still providing guarantees of transient tracking performance throughout the learning phase. Within the proposed approach, a disturbance estimation law is adopted to estimate the pointwise value of the uncertainty, with pre-computable estimation error bounds (EEBs). The learned dynamics, the estimated disturbances, and the EEBs are then incorporated in a robust Riemann energy condition to compute the control law that guarantees exponential convergence of actual trajectories to desired ones throughout the learning phase, even when the learned model is poor. On the other hand, with improved accuracy, the learned model can help improve the robustness of the tracking controller, e.g., against input delays, and can be incorporated to plan better trajectories with improved performance, e.g., lower energy consumption and shorter travel time.The proposed framework is validated on a planar quadrotor example.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

Multimodal trajectory prediction enhances decision-making by considering multiple possible future trajectories based on diverse sources of environmental data. In this approach, we leverage ResNet-50 to extract image features from high-definition map data and use IMU sensor data to calculate speed, acceleration, and yaw rate. A temporal probabilistic network is employed to compute potential trajectories, selecting the most accurate and highly probable trajectory paths. This method integrates HD map data to improve the robustness and reliability of trajectory predictions for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |
| **[PateGail: A Privacy-Preserving Mobility Trajectory Generator with Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16729v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating human mobility trajectories is of great importance to solve the lack of large-scale trajectory data in numerous applications, which is caused by privacy concerns. However, existing mobility trajectory generation methods still require real-world human trajectories centrally collected as the training data, where there exists an inescapable risk of privacy leakage. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we propose PateGail, a privacy-preserving imitation learning model to generate mobility trajectories, which utilizes the powerful generative adversary imitation learning model to simulate the decision-making process of humans. Further, in order to protect user privacy, we train this model collectively based on decentralized mobility data stored in user devices, where personal discriminators are trained locally to distinguish and reward the real and generated human trajectories. In the training process, only the generated trajectories and their rewards obtained based on personal discriminators are shared between the server and devices, whose privacy is further preserved by our proposed perturbation mechanisms with theoretical proof to satisfy differential privacy. Further, to better model the human decision-making process, we propose a novel aggregation mechanism of the rewards obtained from personal discriminators. We theoretically prove that under the reward obtained based on the aggregation mechanism, our proposed model maximizes the lower bound of the discounted total rewards of users. Extensive experiments show that the trajectories generated by our model are able to resemble real-world trajectories in terms of five key statistical metrics, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms by over 48.03%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the synthetic trajectories are able to efficiently support practical applications, including mobility prediction and location recommendation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Stein Variational Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12110v3)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Constrained Stein Variational Trajectory Optimization (CSVTO), an algorithm for performing trajectory optimization with constraints on a set of trajectories in parallel. We frame constrained trajectory optimization as a novel form of constrained functional minimization over trajectory distributions, which avoids treating the constraints as a penalty in the objective and allows us to generate diverse sets of constraint-satisfying trajectories. Our method uses Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) to find a set of particles that approximates a distribution over low-cost trajectories while obeying constraints. CSVTO is applicable to problems with differentiable equality and inequality constraints and includes a novel particle re-sampling step to escape local minima. By explicitly generating diverse sets of trajectories, CSVTO is better able to avoid poor local minima and is more robust to initialization. We demonstrate that CSVTO outperforms baselines in challenging highly-constrained tasks, such as a 7DoF wrench manipulation task, where CSVTO outperforms all baselines both in success and constraint satisfaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Biological knowledge suggests that it may be best to describe complex diseases at the level of underlying pathways, which may interact with one another. We propose a Bayesian approach that allows for characterising such correlation among different pathways through Dependent Gaussian Processes (DGP) and mapping the observed high-dimensional gene expression trajectories into unobserved low-dimensional pathway expression trajectories via Bayesian Sparse Factor Analysis. Our proposal is the first attempt to relax the classical assumption of independent factors for longitudinal data and has demonstrated a superior performance in recovering the shape of pathway expression trajectories, revealing the relationships between genes and pathways, and predicting gene expressions (closer point estimates and narrower predictive intervals), as demonstrated through simulations and real data analysis. To fit the model, we propose a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM) scheme that can be implemented conveniently by combining a standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler and an R package GPFDA (Konzen and others, 2021), which returns the maximum likelihood estimates of DGP hyperparameters. The modular structure of MCEM makes it generalizable to other complex models involving the DGP model component. Our R package DGP4LCF that implements the proposed approach is available on CRAN.</p></details> |  |

However, configuring the skills' parameters for a specific task remains a manual and time-consuming endeavor. Existing approaches for learning or optimizing these parameters often require numerous real-world executions or do not work in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose MuTT, a novel encoder-decoder transformer architecture designed to predict environment-aware executions of robot skills by integrating vision, trajectory, and robot skill parameters. Notably, we pioneer the fusion of vision and trajectory, introducing a novel trajectory projection. Furthermore, we illustrate MuTT's efficacy as a predictor when combined with a model-based robot skill optimizer. This approach facilitates the optimization of robot skill parameters for the current environment, without the need for real-world executions during optimization. Designed for compatibility with any representation of robot skills, MuTT demonstrates its versatility across three comprehensive experiments, showcasing superior performance across two different skill representations.</p></details> |  |

To study this, structured clinical variables from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) data have traditionally been employed by many researchers.

In this paper, we propose a systematic methodology for developing sepsis prognostic pathways derived from clinical notes, focusing on diverse patient subgroups identified by exploring comorbidities associated with sepsis and generating explanations of these subgroups using SHAP. The extracted prognostic pathways of these subgroups provide valuable insights into the dynamic trajectories of sepsis severity over time. Visualizing these pathways sheds light on the likelihood and direction of disease progression across various contexts and reveals patterns and pivotal factors or biomarkers influencing the transition between sepsis stages, whether toward deterioration or improvement.

Some leading methods in this domain prioritize long-range matching, involving the unrolling of training trajectories with a fixed number of steps (NS) on the synthetic dataset to align with various expert training trajectories. However, traditional long-range matching methods possess an overfitting-like problem, the fixed step size NS forces synthetic dataset to distortedly conform seen expert training trajectories, resulting in a loss of generality-especially to those from unencountered architecture. We refer to this as the Accumulated Mismatching Problem (AMP), and propose a new approach, Automatic Training Trajectories (ATT), which dynamically and adaptively adjusts trajectory length NS to address the AMP. Our method outperforms existing methods particularly in tests involving cross-architectures.

Trajectory optimisation algorithms have proved their utility in a wide variety of tasks, but, like most methods struggle scaling to the high dimensional systems ubiquitous to non-prehensile manipulation in clutter as well as deformable object manipulation. We reason that, during manipulation, different degrees of freedom will become more or less important to the task over time as the system evolves. We leverage this idea to reduce the number of degrees of freedom considered in a trajectory optimisation problem, to reduce planning times. This idea is particularly relevant in the context of model predictive control (MPC) where the cost landscape of the optimisation problem is constantly evolving. We provide simulation results under asynchronous MPC and show our methods are capable of achieving better overall performance due to the decreased policy lag whilst still being able to optimise trajectories effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures, accepted to WAFR 2024</p></details> |

This paper introduces a self-optimizing controller, Type-1 fuzzyPID, which leverages dynamic and static system response analysis to overcome the limitations of manual tuning. To account for system uncertainties, an Interval Type-2 fuzzyPID controller is also developed. Both controllers are designed using Matlab/Simulink and tested through trajectory tracking simulations in the CoppeliaSim environment. Additionally, a non-linear model predictive controller(NMPC) is proposed and compared against the fuzzyPID controllers. The impact of tunable parameters on NMPC tracking accuracy is thoroughly examined. We also present plots of the step-response characteristics and noise rejection experiments for each controller. Simulation results validate the precision and effectiveness of NMPC over fuzzyPID controllers while trading computational complexity.

To tackle this challenge, we propose a progressive 3D editing strategy that ensures multi-view consistency via a Trajectory-Anchored Scheme (TAS) with a dual-branch editing mechanism. Specifically, TAS facilitates a tightly coupled iterative process between 2D view editing and 3D updating, preventing error accumulation yielded from text-to-image process. Additionally, we explore the relationship between optimization-based methods and reconstruction-based methods, offering a unified perspective for selecting superior design choice, supporting the rationale behind the designed TAS. We further present a tuning-free View-Consistent Attention Control (VCAC) module that leverages cross-view semantic and geometric reference from the source branch to yield aligned views from the target branch during the editing of 2D views. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we analyze 2D examples to demonstrate the improved consistency with the VCAC module. Further extensive quantitative and qualitative results in text-guided 3D scene editing indicate that our method achieves superior editing quality compared to state-of-the-art methods. We will make the complete codebase publicly available following the conclusion of the review process.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods often struggle to balance resource conservation, accurate state estimation and precise tracking, resulting in suboptimal performance. This problem is particularly pronounced in environments with large action spaces, where the need for frequent, accurate state data is paramount, yet the capacity for active localization updates is restricted by external limitations. This paper introduces ComTraQ-MPC, a novel framework that combines Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) to optimize trajectory tracking with constrained active localization updates. The meta-trained DQN ensures adaptive active localization scheduling, while the MPC leverages available state information to improve tracking. The central contribution of this work is their reciprocal interaction: DQN's update decisions inform MPC's control strategy, and MPC's outcomes refine DQN's learning, creating a cohesive, adaptive system. Empirical evaluations in simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that ComTraQ-MPC significantly enhances operational efficiency and accuracy, providing a generalizable and approximately optimal solution for trajectory tracking in complex partially observable environments.</p></details> | * Equal contribution |

Understanding the importance of risk factors measured at a mental health visit can help clinicians evaluate future risk and provide appropriate care during the visit. In prediction settings where data are collected over time, such as in mental health care, it is often of interest to understand both the importance of variables for predicting the response at each time point and the importance summarized over the time series. Building on recent advances in estimation and inference for variable importance measures, we define summaries of variable importance trajectories and corresponding estimators. The same approaches for inference can be applied to these measures regardless of the choice of the algorithm(s) used to estimate the prediction function. We propose a nonparametric efficient estimation and inference procedure as well as a null hypothesis testing procedure that are valid even when complex machine learning tools are used for prediction. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed procedures have good operating characteristics. We use these approaches to analyze electronic health records data from two large health systems to investigate the longitudinal importance of risk factors for suicide attempt to inform future suicide prevention research and clinical workflow.</p></details> | <details><summary>81 pa...</summary><p>81 pages (34 main, 47 supplementary), 8 figures (4 main, 4 supplementary), 29 tables (2 main, 27 supplementary)</p></details> |
| **[DBHP: Trajectory Imputation in Multi-Agent Sports Using Derivative-Based Hybrid Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10878v1)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many spatiotemporal domains handle multi-agent trajectory data, but in real-world scenarios, collected trajectory data are often partially missing due to various reasons. While existing approaches demonstrate good performance in trajectory imputation, they face challenges in capturing the complex dynamics and interactions between agents due to a lack of physical constraints that govern realistic trajectories, leading to suboptimal results. To address this issue, the paper proposes a Derivative-Based Hybrid Prediction (DBHP) framework that can effectively impute multiple agents' missing trajectories. First, a neural network equipped with Set Transformers produces a naive prediction of missing trajectories while satisfying the permutation-equivariance in terms of the order of input agents. Then, the framework makes alternative predictions leveraging velocity and acceleration information and combines all the predictions with properly determined weights to provide final imputed trajectories. In this way, our proposed framework not only accurately predicts position, velocity, and acceleration values but also enforces the physical relationship between them, eventually improving both the accuracy and naturalness of the predicted trajectories. Accordingly, the experiment results about imputing player trajectories in team sports show that our framework significantly outperforms existing imputation baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards reliable real-time trajectory optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10731v1)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion planning is a key aspect of robotics. A common approach to address motion planning problems is trajectory optimization. Trajectory optimization can represent the high-level behaviors of robots through mathematical formulations. However, current trajectory optimization approaches have two main challenges. Firstly, their solution heavily depends on the initial guess, and they are prone to get stuck in local minima. Secondly, they face scalability limitations by increasing the number of constraints. This thesis endeavors to tackle these challenges by introducing four innovative trajectory optimization algorithms to improve reliability, scalability, and computational efficiency. There are two novel aspects of the proposed algorithms. The first key innovation is remodeling the kinematic constraints and collision avoidance constraints. Another key innovation lies in the design of algorithms that effectively utilize parallel computation on GPU accelerators. By using reformulated constraints and leveraging the computational power of GPUs, the proposed algorithms of this thesis demonstrate significant improvements in efficiency and scalability compared to the existing methods. Parallelization enables faster computation times, allowing for real-time decision-making in dynamic environments. Moreover, the algorithms are designed to adapt to changes in the environment, ensuring robust performance. Extensive benchmarking for each proposed optimizer validates their efficacy. Overall, this thesis makes a significant contribution to the field of trajectory optimization algorithms. It introduces innovative solutions that specifically address the challenges faced by existing methods. The proposed algorithms pave the way for more efficient and robust motion planning solutions in robotics by leveraging parallel computation and specific mathematical structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD T...</summary><p>PhD Thesis, University of Tartu, 2024.

Traditional automated driving systems recalculate the entire trajectory in a changing environment. Instead, a novel approach retains valid trajectory segments, minimizing the need for complete replanning and reducing changes to the original plan. This work introduces a trajectory repairing framework that calculates a feasible evasive trajectory while computing the Feasible Time-to-React (F-TTR), balancing the maintenance of the original plan with safety assurance. The framework employs a binary search algorithm to iteratively create repaired trajectories, guaranteeing both the safety and feasibility of the trajectory repairing result. In contrast to earlier approaches that separated the calculation of safety metrics from trajectory repairing, which resulted in unsuccessful plans for evasive maneuvers, our work has the anytime capability to provide both a Feasible Time-to-React and an evasive trajectory for further execution.</p></details> |  |

Previous rule-based approaches without the integration of semantic information show a limitation in both efficiency and accuracy. Semantic information, such as activity types inferred from Points of Interest (POI) data, can significantly enhance the quality of trajectory mining. However, integrating these insights is challenging, as many POIs have incomplete feature information, and current learning-based POI algorithms require the integrity of datasets to do the classification. In this paper, we introduce a novel pipeline for human travel trajectory mining. Our approach first leverages the strong inferential and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to annotate POI with activity types and then uses a Bayesian-based algorithm to infer activity for each stay point in a trajectory. In our evaluation using the OpenStreetMap (OSM) POI dataset, our approach achieves a 93.4% accuracy and a 96.1% F-1 score in POI classification, and a 91.7% accuracy with a 92.3% F-1 score in activity inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, accepted for the 27th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2024)</p></details> |

A particularly concerning threat is the vulnerability of CPS to deceptive attacks that degrade system performance while remaining undetected. This paper investigates perfectly undetectable false data injection attacks (FDIAs) targeting the trajectory tracking control of a non-holonomic mobile robot. The proposed attack method utilizes affine transformations of intercepted signals, exploiting weaknesses inherent in the partially linear dynamic properties and symmetry of the nonlinear plant. The feasibility and potential impact of these attacks are validated through experiments using a Turtlebot 3 platform, highlighting the urgent need for sophisticated detection mechanisms and resilient control strategies to safeguard CPS against such threats. Furthermore, a novel approach for detection of these attacks called the state monitoring signature function (SMSF) is introduced. An example SMSF, a carefully designed function resilient to FDIA, is shown to be able to detect the presence of a FDIA through signatures based on systems states.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 17 figures.

Existing benchmarks rely on datasets, which are biased towards more common scenarios, such as cruising, and distance-based metrics that are computed by averaging over all scenarios. Following such a regiment provides a little insight into the properties of the models both in terms of how well they can handle different scenarios and how admissible and diverse their outputs are. There exist a number of complementary metrics designed to measure the admissibility and diversity of trajectories, however, they suffer from biases, such as length of trajectories. In this paper, we propose a new benChmarking paRadIgm for evaluaTing trajEctoRy predIction Approaches (CRITERIA). Particularly, we propose 1) a method for extracting driving scenarios at varying levels of specificity according to the structure of the roads, models' performance, and data properties for fine-grained ranking of prediction models; 2) A set of new bias-free metrics for measuring diversity, by incorporating the characteristics of a given scenario, and admissibility, by considering the structure of roads and kinematic compliancy, motivated by real-world driving constraints. 3) Using the proposed benchmark, we conduct extensive experimentation on a representative set of the prediction models using the large scale Argoverse dataset. We show that the proposed benchmark can produce a more accurate ranking of the models and serve as a means of characterizing their behavior. We further present ablation studies to highlight contributions of different elements that are used to compute the proposed metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[TraDiffusion: Trajectory-Based Training-Free Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09739v1)** | 2024-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a training-free, trajectory-based controllable T2I approach, termed TraDiffusion. This novel method allows users to effortlessly guide image generation via mouse trajectories. To achieve precise control, we design a distance awareness energy function to effectively guide latent variables, ensuring that the focus of generation is within the areas defined by the trajectory. The energy function encompasses a control function to draw the generation closer to the specified trajectory and a movement function to diminish activity in areas distant from the trajectory. Through extensive experiments and qualitative assessments on the COCO dataset, the results reveal that TraDiffusion facilitates simpler, more natural image control. Moreover, it showcases the ability to manipulate salient regions, attributes, and relationships within the generated images, alongside visual input based on arbitrary or enhanced trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code: https://github.com/och-mac/TraDiffusion</p></details> |
| **[Quantifying Signal-to-Noise Ratio in Neural Latent Trajectories via Fisher Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08752v1)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spike train signals recorded from a large population of neurons often exhibit low-dimensional spatio-temporal structure and modeled as conditional Poisson observations. The low-dimensional signals that capture internal brain states are useful for building brain machine interfaces and understanding the neural computation underlying meaningful behavior. We derive a practical upper bound to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of inferred neural latent trajectories using Fisher information. We show that the SNR bound is proportional to the overdispersion factor and the Fisher information per neuron. Further numerical experiments show that inference methods that exploit the temporal regularities can achieve higher SNRs that are proportional to the bound. Our results provide insights for fitting models to data, simulating neural responses, and design of experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article is accepted for publication in the 2024 European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)</p></details> |
| **[COTODE: COntinuous Trajectory neural Ordinary Differential Equations for modelling event sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08055v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Observation of the underlying actors that generate event sequences reveals that they often evolve continuously. Most modern methods, however, tend to model such processes through at most piecewise-continuous trajectories. To address this, we adopt a way of viewing events not as standalone phenomena but instead as observations of a Gaussian Process, which in turn governs the actor's dynamics. We propose integrating these obtained dynamics, resulting in a continuous-trajectory modification of the widely successful Neural ODE model. Through Gaussian Process theory, we were able to evaluate the uncertainty in an actor's representation, which arises from not observing them between events. This estimate led us to develop a novel, theoretically backed negative feedback mechanism. Empirical studies indicate that our model with Gaussian process interpolation and negative feedback achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improvements up to 20% AUROC against similar architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exact Trajectory Similarity Search With N-tree: An Efficient Metric Index for kNN and Range Queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07650v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Similarity search is the problem of finding in a collection of objects those that are similar to a given query object. It is a fundamental problem in modern applications and the objects considered may be as diverse as locations in space, text documents, images, twitter messages, or trajectories of moving objects. In this paper we are motivated by the latter application. Trajectories are recorded movements of mobile objects such as vehicles, animals, public transportation, or parts of the human body. We propose a novel distance function called DistanceAvg to capture the similarity of such movements. To be practical, it is necessary to provide indexing for this distance measure. Fortunately we do not need to start from scratch. A generic and unifying approach is metric space, which organizes the set of objects solely by a distance (similarity) function with certain natural properties. Our function DistanceAvg is a metric. Although metric indexes have been studied for decades and many such structures are available, they do not offer the best performance with trajectories. In this paper we propose a new design, which outperforms the best existing indexes for kNN queries and is equally good for range queries. It is especially suitable for expensive distance functions as they occur in trajectory similarity search. In many applications, kNN queries are more practical than range queries as it may be difficult to determine an appropriate search radius. Our index provides exact result sets for the given distance function.</p></details> | 54 pages, 26 figures |
| **[Harmonious Group Choreography with Trajectory-Controllable Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06189v3)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creating group choreography from music has gained attention in cultural entertainment and virtual reality, aiming to coordinate visually cohesive and diverse group movements. Despite increasing interest, recent works face challenges in achieving aesthetically appealing choreography, primarily for two key issues: multi-dancer collision and single-dancer foot slide. To address these issues, we propose a Trajectory-Controllable Diffusion (TCDiff), a novel approach that harnesses non-overlapping trajectories to facilitate coherent dance movements. Specifically, to tackle dancer collisions, we introduce a Dance-Beat Navigator capable of generating trajectories for multiple dancers based on the music, complemented by a Distance-Consistency loss to maintain appropriate spacing among trajectories within a reasonable threshold. To mitigate foot sliding, we present a Footwork Adaptor that utilizes trajectory displacement from adjacent frames to enable flexible footwork, coupled with a Relative Forward-Kinematic loss to adjust the positioning of individual dancers' root nodes and joints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[RALTPER: A Risk-Aware Local Trajectory Planner for Complex Environment with Gaussian Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05838v1)** | 2024-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel Risk-Aware Local Trajectory Planner (RALTPER) for autonomous vehicles in complex environments characterized by Gaussian uncertainty. The proposed method integrates risk awareness and trajectory planning by leveraging probabilistic models to evaluate the likelihood of collisions with dynamic and static obstacles. The RALTPER focuses on collision avoidance constraints for both the ego vehicle region and the Gaussian-obstacle risk region. Additionally, this work enhances the generalization of both vehicle and obstacle models, making the planner adaptable to a wider range of scenarios. Our approach formulates the planning problem as a nonlinear optimization, solved using the IPOPT solver within the CasADi environment. The planner is evaluated through simulations of various challenging scenarios, including complex, static, mixed environment and narrow single-lane avoidance of pedestrians. Results demonstrate that RALTPER achieves safer and more efficient trajectory planning particularly in navigating narrow areas where a more accurate vehicle profile representation is critical for avoiding collisions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning for Teleoperated Space Manipulators Using Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05460v1)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning for teleoperated space manipulators involves challenges such as accurately modeling system dynamics, particularly in free-floating modes with non-holonomic constraints, and managing time delays that increase model uncertainty and affect control precision. Traditional teleoperation methods rely on precise dynamic models requiring complex parameter identification and calibration, while data-driven methods do not require prior knowledge but struggle with time delays. A novel framework utilizing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is introduced to address these challenges. The framework incorporates three methods: Mapping, Prediction, and State Augmentation, to handle delays when delayed state information is received at the master end. The Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm processes the state information to compute the next action, which is then sent to the remote manipulator for environmental interaction. Four environments are constructed using the MuJoCo simulation platform to account for variations in base and target fixation: fixed base and target, fixed base with rotated target, free-floating base with fixed target, and free-floating base with rotated target. Extensive experiments with both constant and random delays are conducted to evaluate the proposed methods. Results demonstrate that all three methods effectively address trajectory planning challenges, with State Augmentation showing superior efficiency and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear Propagation of Non-Gaussian Uncertainties: Theory and Applications to Spacecraft Trajectory Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05384v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel approach for propagating uncertainties in dynamical systems building on high-order Taylor expansions of the flow and moment-generating functions (MGFs). Unlike prior methods that focus on Gaussian distributions, our approach leverages the relationship between MGFs and distribution moments to extend high-order uncertainty propagation techniques to non-Gaussian scenarios. This significantly broadens the applicability of these methods to a wider range of problems and uncertainty types. High-order moment computations are performed one-off and symbolically, reducing the computational burden of the technique to the calculation of Taylor series coefficients around a nominal trajectory, achieved by efficiently integrating the system's variational equations. Furthermore, the use of the proposed approach in combination with event transition tensors, allows for accurate propagation of uncertainties at specific events, such as the landing surface of a celestial body, the crossing of a predefined Poincar\'e section, or the trigger of an arbitrary event during the propagation. Via numerical simulations we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various astrodynamics applications, including the unperturbed and perturbed two-body problem, and the circular restricted three-body problem, showing that it accurately propagates non-Gaussian uncertainties both at future times and at event manifolds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Distributed Multi-Robot Communication-Aware Trajectory Planning using Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05111v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a distributed, optimal, communication-aware trajectory planning algorithm for multi-robot systems. Building on prior work, it addresses the multi-robot communication-aware trajectory planning problem using a general optimisation framework that imposes linear constraints on changes in robot positions to ensure communication performance and collision avoidance. In this paper, the optimisation problem is solved distributively by separating the communication performance constraint through an economic approach. Here, the current communication budget is distributed equally among the robots, and the robots are allowed to trade parts of their budgets with each other. The separated optimisation problem is then solved using the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers. The method was verified through simulation in an inspection task problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajCogn: Leveraging LLMs for Cognizing Movement Patterns and Travel Purposes from Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12459v2)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal trajectories are crucial in various data mining tasks. It is important to develop a versatile trajectory learning method that performs different tasks with high accuracy. This involves effectively extracting two core aspects of information--movement patterns and travel purposes--from trajectories. However, this is challenging due to limitations in model capacity and the quality and scale of trajectory datasets. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have shown great success in versatility by training on large-scale, high-quality datasets. Given the similarities between trajectories and sentences, there's potential to leverage LLMs to develop an effective trajectory learning method. However, standard LLMs are not designed to handle the unique spatio-temporal features of trajectories and cannot extract movement patterns and travel purposes. To address these challenges, we propose a model called TrajCogn that effectively utilizes LLMs to model trajectories. TrajCogn leverages the strengths of LLMs to create a versatile trajectory learning approach while addressing the limitations of standard LLMs. First, TrajCogn incorporates a novel trajectory semantic embedder that enables LLMs to process spatio-temporal features and extract movement patterns and travel purposes. Second, TrajCogn introduces a new trajectory prompt that integrates these patterns and purposes into LLMs, allowing the model to adapt to various tasks. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and two representative tasks demonstrate that TrajCogn successfully achieves its design goals. Codes are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TrajCogn-5021.</p></details> |  |
| **[PTrajM: Efficient and Semantic-rich Trajectory Learning with Pretrained Trajectory-Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04916v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle trajectories provide crucial movement information for various real-world applications. To better utilize vehicle trajectories, it is essential to develop a trajectory learning approach that can effectively and efficiently extract rich semantic information, including movement behavior and travel purposes, to support accurate downstream applications. However, creating such an approach presents two significant challenges. First, movement behavior are inherently spatio-temporally continuous, making them difficult to extract efficiently from irregular and discrete trajectory points. Second, travel purposes are related to the functionalities of areas and road segments traversed by vehicles. These functionalities are not available from the raw spatio-temporal trajectory features and are hard to extract directly from complex textual features associated with these areas and road segments. To address these challenges, we propose PTrajM, a novel method capable of efficient and semantic-rich vehicle trajectory learning. To support efficient modeling of movement behavior, we introduce Trajectory-Mamba as the learnable model of PTrajM, which effectively extracts continuous movement behavior while being more computationally efficient than existing structures. To facilitate efficient extraction of travel purposes, we propose a travel purpose-aware pre-training procedure, which enables PTrajM to discern the travel purposes of trajectories without additional computational resources during its embedding process. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and comparisons with several state-of-the-art trajectory learning methods demonstrate the effectiveness of PTrajM.

| **[Simulating Articulatory Trajectories with Phonological Feature Interpolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04363v1)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a first step towards a complete computational model of speech learning involving perception-production loops, we investigate the forward mapping between pseudo-motor commands and articulatory trajectories. Two phonological feature sets, based respectively on generative and articulatory phonology, are used to encode a phonetic target sequence. Different interpolation techniques are compared to generate smooth trajectories in these feature spaces, with a potential optimisation of the target value and timing to capture co-articulation effects. We report the Pearson correlation between a linear projection of the generated trajectories and articulatory data derived from a multi-speaker dataset of electromagnetic articulography (EMA) recordings. A correlation of 0.67 is obtained with an extended feature set based on generative phonology and a linear interpolation technique. We discuss the implications of our results for our understanding of the dynamics of biological motion.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at Interspeech 2024</p></details> |
| **[Semi-Supervised Generative Models for Disease Trajectories: A Case Study on Systemic Sclerosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11427v2)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a deep generative approach using latent temporal processes for modeling and holistically analyzing complex disease trajectories, with a particular focus on Systemic Sclerosis (SSc). We aim to learn temporal latent representations of the underlying generative process that explain the observed patient disease trajectories in an interpretable and comprehensive way. To enhance the interpretability of these latent temporal processes, we develop a semi-supervised approach for disentangling the latent space using established medical knowledge. By combining the generative approach with medical definitions of different characteristics of SSc, we facilitate the discovery of new aspects of the disease. We show that the learned temporal latent processes can be utilized for further data analysis and clinical hypothesis testing, including finding similar patients and clustering SSc patient trajectories into novel sub-types. Moreover, our method enables personalized online monitoring and prediction of multivariate time series with uncertainty quantification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Machine Learning for Healthcare 2024. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2311.08149</p></details> |
| **[Grasping Trajectory Optimization with Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05466v2)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new trajectory optimization method for robotic grasping based on a point-cloud representation of robots and task spaces. In our method, robots are represented by 3D points on their link surfaces. The task space of a robot is represented by a point cloud that can be obtained from depth sensors. Using the point-cloud representation, goal reaching in grasping can be formulated as point matching, while collision avoidance can be efficiently achieved by querying the signed distance values of the robot points in the signed distance field of the scene points. Consequently, a constrained nonlinear optimization problem is formulated to solve the joint motion and grasp planning problem. The advantage of our method is that the point-cloud representation is general to be used with any robot in any environment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by performing experiments on a tabletop scene and a shelf scene for grasping with a Fetch mobile manipulator and a Franka Panda arm.

| **[UniTraj: A Unified Framework for Scalable Vehicle Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15098v3)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle trajectory prediction has increasingly relied on data-driven solutions, but their ability to scale to different data domains and the impact of larger dataset sizes on their generalization remain under-explored. While these questions can be studied by employing multiple datasets, it is challenging due to several discrepancies, e.g., in data formats, map resolution, and semantic annotation types. To address these challenges, we introduce UniTraj, a comprehensive framework that unifies various datasets, models, and evaluation criteria, presenting new opportunities for the vehicle trajectory prediction field. In particular, using UniTraj, we conduct extensive experiments and find that model performance significantly drops when transferred to other datasets. However, enlarging data size and diversity can substantially improve performance, leading to a new state-of-the-art result for the nuScenes dataset. We provide insights into dataset characteristics to explain these findings.

Model predictive path integral control is a framework that builds upon optimization principles while incorporating stochastic sampling of input trajectories. This paper investigates several sampling approaches for trajectory generation. In this context, normalizing flows originating from the field of variational inference are considered for the generation of sampling distributions, as they model transformations of simple to more complex distributions. Accordingly, learning-based normalizing flow models are trained for a more efficient exploration of the input domain for the task at hand. The developed algorithm and the proposed sampling distributions are evaluated in two simulation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published as part of the 2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), Jeju Shinhwa World, Jeju Island, Korea, June 2-5, 2024</p></details> |
| **[TGS: Trajectory Generation and Selection using Vision Language Models in Mapless Outdoor Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02454v2)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a multi-modal trajectory generation and selection algorithm for real-world mapless outdoor navigation in challenging scenarios with unstructured off-road features like buildings, grass, and curbs. Our goal is to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating in crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We use VLMs and a visual prompting approach with their zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our methods in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe at least 3.35% improvement in traversability and 20.61% improvement in terms of human-like navigation in generated trajectories in challenging outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pose-Aware Self-Supervised Learning with Viewpoint Trajectory Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14973v2)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning visual features from unlabeled images has proven successful for semantic categorization, often by mapping different $views$ of the same object to the same feature to achieve recognition invariance. However, visual recognition involves not only identifying $what$ an object is but also understanding $how$ it is presented. For example, seeing a car from the side versus head-on is crucial for deciding whether to stay put or jump out of the way. While unsupervised feature learning for downstream viewpoint reasoning is important, it remains under-explored, partly due to the lack of a standardized evaluation method and benchmarks. We introduce a new dataset of adjacent image triplets obtained from a viewpoint trajectory, without any semantic or pose labels. We benchmark both semantic classification and pose estimation accuracies on the same visual feature. Additionally, we propose a viewpoint trajectory regularization loss for learning features from unlabeled image triplets. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach helps develop a visual representation that encodes object identity and organizes objects by their poses, retaining semantic classification accuracy while achieving emergent global pose awareness and better generalization to novel objects. Our dataset and code are available at http://pwang.pw/trajSSL/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024</p></details> |
| **[Transfer Learning Study of Motion Transformer-based Trajectory Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08271v3)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning in autonomous driving is highly dependent on predicting the emergent behavior of other road users. Learning-based methods are currently showing impressive results in simulation-based challenges, with transformer-based architectures technologically leading the way. Ultimately, however, predictions are needed in the real world. In addition to the shifts from simulation to the real world, many vehicle- and country-specific shifts, i.e. differences in sensor systems, fusion and perception algorithms as well as traffic rules and laws, are on the agenda. Since models that can cover all system setups and design domains at once are not yet foreseeable, model adaptation plays a central role. Therefore, a simulation-based study on transfer learning techniques is conducted on basis of a transformer-based model. Furthermore, the study aims to provide insights into possible trade-offs between computational time and performance to support effective transfers into the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), Jeju Shinhwa World, Jeju Island, Korea, June 2-5, 2024</p></details> |

Such a robot needs to be able to constantly adapt to the surrounding scene based on egocentric vision, and predict the ego motion of the wearer. In this work, we leveraged body-mounted cameras and sensors to anticipate the trajectory of human wearers through complex surroundings. To facilitate research in ego-motion prediction, we have collected a comprehensive walking scene navigation dataset centered on the user's perspective. We then present a method to predict human motion conditioning on the surrounding static scene. Our method leverages a diffusion model to produce a distribution of potential future trajectories, taking into account the user's observation of the environment. To that end, we introduce a compact representation to encode the user's visual memory of the surroundings, as well as an efficient sample-generating technique to speed up real-time inference of a diffusion model. We ablate our model and compare it to baselines, and results show that our model outperforms existing methods on key metrics of collision avoidance and trajectory mode coverage.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

In this work, we introduce Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Demonstration Imitation (STODI), a trajectory optimization framework for robots to imitate the shape of demonstration trajectories with improved dynamic performance. Consistent with the human learning process, demonstration imitation serves as an initial step, while trajectory optimization aims to enhance robot motion performance. By generating random noise and constructing proper cost functions, the STODI effectively explores and exploits generated noisy trajectories while preserving the demonstration shape characteristics. We employ three metrics to measure the similarity of trajectories in both the time and frequency domains to help with demonstration imitation. Theoretical analysis reveals relationships among these metrics, emphasizing the benefits of frequency-domain analysis for specific tasks. Experiments on a 7-DOF robotic arm in the PyBullet simulator validate the efficacy of the STODI framework, showcasing the improved optimization performance and stability compared to previous methods.</p></details> |  |

To perform these requirements, we use a nonlinear Lyapunov-based approach for designing the controller and guaranteeing its stability. MATLAB-SIMULINK software is used to validate the approach and demonstrate the performance of the controller. Simulation results show that the derived controller is stable, robust to the disturbance and uncertainties, accurate, and implementable.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a holistic framework that jointly optimizes the total latency and energy consumption for UAV-assisted fog computing in a three-dimensional spatial domain with varying terrain elevations and dynamic task generations. Our proposed framework considers three important and interdependent modules: attitude control, trajectory planning, and task assignment. We first establish a fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative control model to determine the UAV's attitude. Then, we propose an enhanced Ant Colony System (ACS) based algorithm, that includes a safety value and a decoupling mechanism to overcome the convergence issue in classical ACS, to compute the optimal UAV trajectory. Finally, we design an algorithm based on the Particle Swarm Optimization technique, to determine where each offloaded task should be executed. Under our proposed framework, the outcome of one module would affect the decision-making in one other, providing a holistic perspective of the system and thus leading to improved solutions. We demonstrate by extensive simulation results that our proposed framework can significantly improve the overall performance, measured by latency and energy consumption, compared to existing baseline approaches.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

Such manoeuvring flight envelope variations, governed by the aircraft's complex nonlinear dynamics, are unpredictable by pilots and existing flight management systems. To prevent in-flight Loss of Control, post-failure trajectories must be optimal, planned in real-time, avoid terrain, and adhere to the impaired aircraft's reduced manoeuvrability and dynamic constraints. This paper presents a novel real-time trajectory optimization method for impaired aircraft based on a combination of differential flatness theory, the pseudospectral method, nonlinear programming, and inverse dynamics. In the proposed method, which utilizes a high-fidelity nonlinear six degree-of-freedom model, to conform to aircraft's altered dynamics a sequence of trim points is selected from the impaired aircraft's manoeuvring flight envelope based on the chosen optimization criteria, ensuring that the resulting three-dimensional trajectory observes terrain avoidance. Then, the required control inputs are obtained for each manoeuvre in less than a second. The method is applied to the NASA Generic Transport Model with rudder failure near a complex mountainous terrain. Both an optimal one-piece trajectory and a near-optimal piecewise path consisting of several optimal trajectories, are generated in non-real-time and real-time, respectively, and compared. Results show that the near-optimal real-time trajectory retains up to 80% of the optimality.</p></details> | <details><summary>56 pa...</summary><p>56 pages, 21 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[LC-LLM: Explainable Lane-Change Intention and Trajectory Predictions with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18344v2)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To ensure safe driving in dynamic environments, autonomous vehicles should possess the capability to accurately predict lane change intentions of surrounding vehicles in advance and forecast their future trajectories. Existing motion prediction approaches have ample room for improvement, particularly in terms of long-term prediction accuracy and interpretability. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing LC-LLM, an explainable lane change prediction model that leverages the strong reasoning capabilities and self-explanation abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Essentially, we reformulate the lane change prediction task as a language modeling problem, processing heterogeneous driving scenario information as natural language prompts for LLMs and employing supervised fine-tuning to tailor LLMs specifically for lane change prediction task. Additionally, we finetune the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve prediction transparency and reliability, and include explanatory requirements in the prompts during inference stage. Therefore, our LC-LLM model not only predicts lane change intentions and trajectories but also provides CoT reasoning and explanations for its predictions, enhancing its interpretability. Extensive experiments based on the large-scale highD dataset demonstrate the superior performance and interpretability of our LC-LLM in lane change prediction task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize LLMs for predicting lane change behavior.

Due to a large amount of variability in brain anatomy between different individuals, we hypothesize that leveraging MRI time series can help improve specificity, by treating each patient as their own baseline. Here we turn to conditional variational autoencoders to generate individualized MRI predictions given the subject's age, disease status and one previous scan. Using serial imaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we train a novel architecture to build a latent space distribution which can be sampled from to generate future predictions of changing anatomy. This enables us to extrapolate beyond the dataset and predict MRIs up to 10 years. We evaluated the model on a held-out set from ADNI and an independent dataset (from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies). By comparing to several alternatives, we show that our model produces more individualized images with higher resolution. Further, if an individual already has a follow-up MRI, we demonstrate a usage of our model to compute a likelihood ratio classifier for disease status. In practice, the model may be able to assist in early diagnosis of AD and provide a counterfactual baseline trajectory for treatment effect estimation. Furthermore, it generates a synthetic dataset that can potentially be used for downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI 2024 LDTM workshop</p></details> |
| **[Service Placement and Trajectory Design for Heterogeneous Tasks in Multi-UAV Cooperative Computing Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01680v1)** | 2024-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we consider deploying multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to enhance the computation service of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) through collaborative computation among UAVs. In particular, the tasks of different types and service requirements in MEC network are offloaded from one UAV to another. To pursue the goal of low-carbon edge computing, we study the problem of minimizing system energy consumption by jointly optimizing computation resource allocation, task scheduling, service placement, and UAV trajectories. Considering the inherent unpredictability associated with task generation and the dynamic nature of wireless fading channels, addressing this problem presents a significant challenge. To overcome this issue, we reformulate the complicated non-convex problem as a Markov decision process and propose a soft actor-critic-based trajectory optimization and resource allocation algorithm to implement a flexible learning strategy. Numerical results illustrate that within a multi-UAV-enabled MEC network, the proposed algorithm effectively reduces the system energy consumption in heterogeneous tasks and services scenarios compared to other baseline solutions.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |

In the past, relatively simple physics-motivated priors have been considered for such approaches, using assumptions such as constant velocity or acceleration. This paper presents an approach to incorporating exogenous control inputs, such as velocity or acceleration commands, into the continuous Gaussian process state-estimation framework. It is shown that this approach generalizes across different domains in robotics, making it applicable to both the estimation of continuous-time trajectories for mobile robots and continuum-robot shapes. Results show that incorporating control inputs leads to more informed priors, potentially requiring less measurements and estimation nodes to obtain accurate estimates. This makes the approach particularly useful in situations in which limited sensing is available.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

In this study, we focus on a scenario where a connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) serves as the central agent, utilizing both sensors and communication technologies to perceive its surrounding traffics consisting of autonomous vehicles (AVs), connected vehicles (CVs), and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Our trajectory prediction task is aimed at all the detected surrounding vehicles. To effectively integrate the multi-source data from both sensor and communication technologies, we propose a deep learning framework called MSMA utilizing a cross-attention module for multi-source data fusion. Vector map data is utilized to provide contextual information. The trajectory dataset is collected in CARLA simulator with synthesized data errors introduced. Numerical experiments demonstrate that in a mixed traffic flow scenario, the integration of data from different sources enhances our understanding of the environment. This notably improves trajectory prediction accuracy, particularly in situations with a high CV market penetration rate. The code is available at: https://github.com/xichennn/MSMA.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid advancement in connected technologies, such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, valuable information from alternate views becomes accessible via wireless networks. The integration of information from alternative views has the potential to overcome the inherent limitations associated with a single viewpoint, such as occlusions and limited field of view. In this work, we introduce V2INet, a novel trajectory prediction framework designed to model multi-view data by extending existing single-view models. Unlike previous approaches where the multi-view data is manually fused or formulated as a separate training stage, our model supports end-to-end training, enhancing both flexibility and performance. Moreover, the predicted multimodal trajectories are calibrated by a post-hoc conformal prediction module to get valid and efficient confidence regions. We evaluated the entire framework using the real-world V2I dataset V2X-Seq. Our results demonstrate superior performance in terms of Final Displacement Error (FDE) and Miss Rate (MR) using a single GPU.

However, the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) are based on supervised deep learning - which leads to challenges when the distribution of trajectories changes due to such a shock. We provide a neuro-symbolic rule-based framework to conduct error correction and detection of these models to integrate into our movement trajectory platform. We provide a suite of experiments on several recent SOTA models where we show highly accurate error detection, the ability to improve accuracy with a changing test distribution, and accuracy improvement for the base use case in addition to a suite of theoretical properties that informed algorithm development. Specifically, we show an F1 scores for predicting errors of up to 0.984, significant performance increase for out-of distribution accuracy (8.51% improvement over SOTA for zero-shot accuracy), and accuracy improvement over the SOTA model.</p></details> |  |

To tackle these challenges, we introduce Optimal Gaussian Diffusion (OGD) and Estimated Clean Manifold (ECM) Guidance. OGD optimizes the prior distribution for a small diffusion time $T$ and starts the reverse diffusion process from it. ECM directly injects guidance gradients to the estimated clean manifold, eliminating extensive gradient backpropagation throughout the network. Our methodology streamlines the generative process, enabling practical applications with reduced computational overhead. Experimental validation on the large-scale Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrates our approach's superior performance, offering a viable solution for computationally efficient, high-quality joint trajectory prediction and controllable generation for autonomous driving.

In this process, the complexity of algorithms used for vehicle control has grown significantly. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a prominent example, which has gained enormous popularity and is now widely used for vehicle motion planning and control. However, safety concerns constrain its practical application, especially since traditional procedures of functional safety (FS), with its universal standard ISO26262, reach their limits. Concomitantly, the new aspect of safety-of-the-intended-function (SOTIF) has moved into the center of attention, whose standard, ISO21448, has only been released in 2022. Thus, experience with SOTIF is low and few case studies are available in industry and research. Hence this paper aims to make two main contributions: (1) an analysis of the SOTIF for a generic MPC-based trajectory planner and (2) an interpretation and concrete application of the generic procedures described in ISO21448 for determining functional insufficiencies (FIs) and triggering conditions (TCs). Particular novelties of the paper include an approach for the out-of-context development of SOTIF-related elements (SOTIF-EooC), a compilation of important FIs and TCs for a MPC-based trajectory planner, and an optimized safety concept based on the identified FIs and TCs for the MPC-based trajectory planner.</p></details> | Extended Version |

We propose an expression exploration framework based on deep symbolic regression (DSR) integrated with a variable intersection selection (VIS) method to find variable combinations that encourage interpretable and parsimonious mathematical expressions. In the exploration learning process, two penalty terms are added to improve the reward function: (i) a complexity penalty to regulate the complexity of the explored expressions to be parsimonious, and (ii) a variable interaction penalty to encourage the expression exploration to focus on variable combinations that can best describe the data. We show the performance of the proposed method to learn several car-following dynamics models and discuss its limitations and future research directions.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, the potential of transformer-based diffusion models for effectively generating videos with controllable motion remains an area of limited exploration. This paper introduces Tora, the first trajectory-oriented DiT framework that integrates textual, visual, and trajectory conditions concurrently for video generation. Specifically, Tora consists of a Trajectory Extractor~(TE), a Spatial-Temporal DiT, and a Motion-guidance Fuser~(MGF). The TE encodes arbitrary trajectories into hierarchical spacetime motion patches with a 3D video compression network. The MGF integrates the motion patches into the DiT blocks to generate consistent videos following trajectories. Our design aligns seamlessly with DiT's scalability, allowing precise control of video content's dynamics with diverse durations, aspect ratios, and resolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate Tora's excellence in achieving high motion fidelity, while also meticulously simulating the movement of the physical world.

Learning-based approaches for multi-agent trajectory prediction, such as primarily relying on graph neural networks, graph transformers, and hypergraph neural networks, have demonstrated outstanding performance on real-world datasets in recent years. However, the hypergraph transformer-based method for trajectory prediction is yet to be explored. Therefore, we present a MultiscAle Relational Transformer (MART) network for multi-agent trajectory prediction. MART is a hypergraph transformer architecture to consider individual and group behaviors in transformer machinery. The core module of MART is the encoder, which comprises a Pair-wise Relational Transformer (PRT) and a Hyper Relational Transformer (HRT). The encoder extends the capabilities of a relational transformer by introducing HRT, which integrates hyperedge features into the transformer mechanism, promoting attention weights to focus on group-wise relations. In addition, we propose an Adaptive Group Estimator (AGE) designed to infer complex group relations in real-world environments. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets (NBA, SDD, and ETH-UCY) demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, enhancing ADE/FDE by 3.9%/11.8% on the NBA dataset.

Due to the intractable growth of non-convex constraints with the number of agents, exploring various homotopy classes that imply different convex domains, is crucial for finding a feasible solution. However, existing methods struggle to explore various homotopy classes efficiently due to combining it with time-consuming precise trajectory solution finding. CSDO, addresses this limitation by separating them into different levels and integrating an efficient Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithm to search homotopy classes. It first searches for a coarse initial guess using a large search step, identifying a specific homotopy class. Subsequent decentralized Quadratic Programming (QP) refinement processes this guess, resolving minor collisions efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that CSDO outperforms existing MVTP algorithms in large-scale, high-density scenarios, achieving up to 95% success rate in 50m $\times$ 50m random scenarios around one second.

We introduce the Enhanced Transformer for Health Outcome Simulation (ETHOS), a novel application of the transformer deep-learning architecture for analyzing high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and episodic health data. ETHOS is trained using Patient Health Timelines (PHTs)-detailed, tokenized records of health events-to predict future health trajectories, leveraging a zero-shot learning approach. ETHOS represents a significant advancement in foundation model development for healthcare analytics, eliminating the need for labeled data and model fine-tuning. Its ability to simulate various treatment pathways and consider patient-specific factors positions ETHOS as a tool for care optimization and addressing biases in healthcare delivery. Future developments will expand ETHOS' capabilities to incorporate a wider range of data types and data sources. Our work demonstrates a pathway toward accelerated AI development and deployment in healthcare.</p></details> |  |

Forward application of the model yields so called imagined trajectories (sequences of action, predicted state-reward) used to optimize the set of candidate actions that maximize expected reward. The outcome, an ideal imagined trajectory or plan, is imperfect and typically MBRL relies on model predictive control (MPC) to overcome this by continuously re-planning from scratch, incurring thus major computational cost and increasing complexity in tasks with longer receding horizon. We propose uncertainty estimation methods for online evaluation of imagined trajectories to assess whether further planned actions can be trusted to deliver acceptable reward. These methods include comparing the error after performing the last action with the standard expected error and using model uncertainty to assess the deviation from expected outcomes. Additionally, we introduce methods that exploit the forward propagation of the dynamics model to evaluate if the remainder of the plan aligns with expected results and assess the remainder of the plan in terms of the expected reward. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed uncertainty estimation methods by applying them to avoid unnecessary trajectory replanning in a shooting MBRL setting. Results highlight significant reduction on computational costs without sacrificing performance.</p></details> |  |

Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC)-based planners provide non-conservative planning, but do not rule out a (small) probability of collision. We propose a control scheme that yields an efficient trajectory based on SMPC when the traffic scenario allows, still avoiding that the vehicle causes collisions with traffic participants if the latter move according to the prediction assumptions. If some traffic participant does not behave as anticipated, no safety guarantee can be given. Then, our approach yields a trajectory which minimizes the probability of collision, using Constraint Violation Probability Minimization techniques. Our algorithm can also be adapted to minimize the anticipated harm caused by a collision. We provide a thorough discussion of the benefits of our novel control scheme and compare it to a previous approach through numerical simulations from the CommonRoad database.</p></details> |  |

However, efficiently capturing the true trajectory distribution with a compact set is challenging. In this work, we propose a novel approach for generating scene-specific trajectory sets that better represent the diversity and admissibility of future actor behavior. Our method constructs multiple trajectory sets tailored to different scene contexts, such as intersections and non-intersections, by leveraging map information and actor dynamics. We introduce a deterministic goal sampling algorithm that identifies relevant map regions and generates trajectories conditioned on the scene layout. Furthermore, we empirically investigate various sampling strategies and set sizes to optimize the trade-off between coverage and diversity. Experiments on the Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrate that our scene-specific sets achieve higher plausibility while maintaining diversity compared to traditional single-set approaches. The proposed Recursive In-Distribution Subsampling (RIDS) method effectively condenses the representation space and outperforms metric-driven sampling in terms of trajectory admissibility. Our work highlights the benefits of scene-aware trajectory set generation for capturing the complex and heterogeneous nature of actor behavior in real-world driving scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Aircraft Trajectory Segmentation-based Contrastive Coding (ATSCC), a novel self-supervised time series representation learning framework designed to capture semantic information in air traffic trajectory data. The framework leverages the segmentable characteristic of trajectories and ensures consistency within the self-assigned segments. Intensive experiments were conducted on datasets from three different airports, totaling four datasets, comparing the learned representation's performance of downstream classification and clustering with other state-of-the-art representation learning techniques. The results show that ATSCC outperforms these methods by aligning with the labels defined by aeronautical procedures. ATSCC is adaptable to various airport configurations and scalable to incomplete trajectories. This research has expanded upon existing capabilities, achieving these improvements independently without predefined inputs such as airport configurations, maneuvering procedures, or labeled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures.

Typical stochastic mobility models, e.g., random waypoint model and Gauss Markov model, can hardly capture the distribution characteristics of users within real-world areas. State-of-the-art trace-based mobility models and existing learning-based trajectory generation methods, however, are frequently constrained by the inaccessibility of substantial real trajectories due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we harness the intrinsic correlation between street maps and trajectories and develop a novel zero-shot trajectory generation method, named Map2Traj, by exploiting the diffusion model. We incorporate street maps as a condition to consistently pilot the denoising process and train our model on diverse sets of real trajectories from various regions in Xi'an, China, and their corresponding street maps. With solely the street map of an unobserved area, Map2Traj generates synthetic trajectories that not only closely resemble the real-world mobility pattern but also offer comparable efficacy. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our proposed method on zero-shot trajectory generation tasks in terms of both trajectory and distribution similarities. In addition, a case study of employing Map2Traj in wireless network optimization is presented to validate its efficacy for downstream applications.</p></details> |  |

SAPI uses an abstract way to represent and encode surrounding environment by utilizing information from real-time map, right-of-way, and surrounding traffic. The proposed model consists of two convolutional network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN)-based encoders and one decoder. A refiner is proposed to conduct a look-back operation inside the model, in order to make full use of raw history trajectory information. We evaluate SAPI on a proprietary dataset collected in real-world intersections through autonomous vehicles. It is demonstrated that SAPI shows promising performance when predicting vehicle trajectories at intersection, and outperforms benchmark methods. The average displacement error(ADE) and final displacement error(FDE) for 6-second prediction are 1.84m and 4.32m respectively. We also show that the proposed model can accurately predict vehicle trajectories in different scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we propose a text-based trajectory generation model that attempts to address all three challenges while relying on only a handful of demonstration trajectory data. Our key idea is to leverage recent flow-based models capable of capturing complex conditional distributions, not directly in the high-dimensional trajectory space, but rather in the low-dimensional latent coordinate space of the motion manifold, with deliberately designed regularization terms to ensure smoothness of motions and robustness to text variations. We show that our {\it Motion Manifold Flow Primitive (MMFP)} framework can accurately generate qualitatively distinct motions for a wide range of text inputs, significantly outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, under review</p></details> |

Traditional methods usually perform holistic inference on the trajectories of agents, neglecting the differences in prediction difficulty among agents. This paper proposes a novel Difficulty-Guided Feature Enhancement Network (DGFNet), which leverages the prediction difficulty differences among agents for multi-agent trajectory prediction. Firstly, we employ spatio-temporal feature encoding and interaction to capture rich spatio-temporal features. Secondly, a difficulty-guided decoder is used to control the flow of future trajectories into subsequent modules, obtaining reliable future trajectories. Then, feature interaction and fusion are performed through the future feature interaction module. Finally, the fused agent features are fed into the final predictor to generate the predicted trajectory distributions for multiple participants. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Argoverse 1\&2 motion forecasting benchmarks. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each module. Moreover, compared with SOTA methods, our method balances trajectory prediction accuracy and real-time inference speed.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, with the increasing granularity and complexity of vehicle-generated data, the lack of data quality audits raises concerns about multi-party mistrust in trajectory prediction tasks. In response, this paper proposes an asynchronous federated learning data sharing method based on an interpretable reputation quantization mechanism utilizing graph neural network tools. Data providers share data structures under differential privacy constraints to ensure security while reducing redundant data. We implement deep reinforcement learning to categorize vehicles by reputation level, which optimizes the aggregation efficiency of federated learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed data sharing scheme not only reinforces the security of the trajectory prediction task but also enhances prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Human trajectory prediction is a noisy process, and no prediction does precisely match any future trajectory. It is therefore approached as a stochastic problem, where the goal is to minimise the error between the true and the predicted trajectory. In this work, we explore the application of metamorphic testing for human trajectory prediction. Metamorphic testing is designed to handle unclear or missing test oracles. It is well-designed for human trajectory prediction, where there is no clear criterion of correct or incorrect human behaviour. Metamorphic relations rely on transformations over source test cases and exploit invariants. A setting well-designed for human trajectory prediction where there are many symmetries of expected human behaviour under variations of the input, e.g. mirroring and rescaling of the input data. We discuss how metamorphic testing can be applied to stochastic human trajectory prediction and introduce the Wasserstein Violation Criterion to statistically assess whether a follow-up test case violates a label-preserving metamorphic relation.</p></details> | <details><summary>MET'2...</summary><p>MET'24: 9th ACM International Workshop on Metamorphic Testing</p></details> |

If the opposing vehicles do not react to the ego vehicle, they can be predicted accurately. However, if there is interaction between the vehicles, the prediction loses its validity. For high interaction, instead of a planning approach that reacts exclusively to the fixed prediction, a trajectory planning approach is required that incorporates the interaction with the opposing vehicles. This paper demonstrates the limitations of a widely used conventional sampling-based approach within a highly interactive blocking scenario. We show that high success rates are achieved for less aggressive blocking behavior but that the collision rate increases with more significant interaction. We further propose a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based trajectory planning approach for racing that explicitly exploits the interaction with the opposing vehicle without requiring a prediction. In contrast to the conventional approach, the RL-based approach achieves high success rates even for aggressive blocking behavior. Furthermore, we propose a novel safety layer (SL) that intervenes when the trajectory generated by the RL-based approach is infeasible. In that event, the SL generates a sub-optimal but feasible trajectory, avoiding termination of the scenario due to a not found valid solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, accepted to be published at the 27th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems, September 24 - 27, 2024, Edmonton, Canada</p></details> |
| **[Sampling-Based Hierarchical Trajectory Planning for Formation Flight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17392v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formation flight of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) poses significant challenges in terms of safety and formation keeping, particularly in cluttered environments. However, existing methods often struggle to simultaneously satisfy these two critical requirements. To address this issue, this paper proposes a sampling-based trajectory planning method with a hierarchical structure for formation flight in dense obstacle environments. To ensure reliable local sensing information sharing among UAVs, each UAV generates a safe flight corridor (SFC), which is transmitted to the leader UAV. Subsequently, a sampling-based formation guidance path generation method is designed as the front-end strategy, steering the formation to fly in the desired shape safely with the formation connectivity provided by the SFCs. Furthermore, a model predictive path integral (MPPI) based distributed trajectory optimization method is developed as the back-end part, which ensures the smoothness, safety and dynamics feasibility of the executable trajectory. To validate the efficiency of the developed algorithm, comprehensive simulation comparisons are conducted.

However, measuring real-world detouring behavior is challenging due to the need to track the movement of individual vehicles. Recent developments in high-resolution vehicle trajectory data have enabled transportation professionals to observe real-world detouring behaviors without the need to install and maintain hardware such as license plate reading cameras. This paper investigates the feasibility of vehicle probe trajectory data to capture commercial motor vehicle (CMV) detouring behavior under three unique case studies. Before doing so, a validation analysis was conducted to investigate the ability of CMV probe trajectory data to represent overall CMV volumes at well-calibrated count stations near virtual weigh stations (VWS) in Maryland. The validation analysis showed strong positive correlations (above 0.75) at all VWS stations. Upon validating the data, a methodology was applied to assess CMV detour behaviors associated with CMV enforcement activities, congestion avoidance, and incident induced temporary road closures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting 2024.

| **[TLControl: Trajectory and Language Control for Human Motion Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17135v4)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable human motion synthesis is essential for applications in AR/VR, gaming and embodied AI. Existing methods often focus solely on either language or full trajectory control, lacking precision in synthesizing motions aligned with user-specified trajectories, especially for multi-joint control. To address these issues, we present TLControl, a novel method for realistic human motion synthesis, incorporating both low-level Trajectory and high-level Language semantics controls, through the integration of neural-based and optimization-based techniques. Specifically, we begin with training a VQ-VAE for a compact and well-structured latent motion space organized by body parts. We then propose a Masked Trajectories Transformer (MTT) for predicting a motion distribution conditioned on language and trajectory. Once trained, we use MTT to sample initial motion predictions given user-specified partial trajectories and text descriptions as conditioning. Finally, we introduce a test-time optimization to refine these coarse predictions for precise trajectory control, which offers flexibility by allowing users to specify various optimization goals and ensures high runtime efficiency. Comprehensive experiments show that TLControl significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in trajectory accuracy and time efficiency, making it practical for interactive and high-quality animation generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reacting on human stubbornness in human-machine trajectory planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17275v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, a method for a cooperative trajectory planning between a human and an automation is extended by a behavioral model of the human. This model can characterize the stubbornness of the human, which measures how strong the human adheres to his preferred trajectory. Accordingly, a static model is introduced indicating a link between the force in haptically coupled human-robot interactions and humans's stubbornness. The introduced stubbornness parameter enables an application-independent reaction of the automation for the cooperative trajectory planning. Simulation results in the context of human-machine cooperation in a care application show that the proposed behavioral model can quantitatively estimate the stubbornness of the interacting human, enabling a more targeted adaptation of the automation to the human behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-aware Multi-task Learning for Pedestrian Intent and Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17162v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of socially-aware autonomous vehicles hinges on precise modeling of human behavior. Within this broad paradigm, the specific challenge lies in accurately predicting pedestrian's trajectory and intention. Traditional methodologies have leaned heavily on historical trajectory data, frequently overlooking vital contextual cues such as pedestrian-specific traits and environmental factors. Furthermore, there's a notable knowledge gap as trajectory and intention prediction have largely been approached as separate problems, despite their mutual dependence. To bridge this gap, we introduce PTINet (Pedestrian Trajectory and Intention Prediction Network), which jointly learns the trajectory and intention prediction by combining past trajectory observations, local contextual features (individual pedestrian behaviors), and global features (signs, markings etc.). The efficacy of our approach is evaluated on widely used public datasets: JAAD and PIE, where it has demonstrated superior performance over existing state-of-the-art models in trajectory and intention prediction. The results from our experiments and ablation studies robustly validate PTINet's effectiveness in jointly exploring intention and trajectory prediction for pedestrian behaviour modelling. The experimental evaluation indicates the advantage of using global and local contextual features for pedestrian trajectory and intention prediction. The effectiveness of PTINet in predicting pedestrian behavior paves the way for the development of automated systems capable of seamlessly interacting with pedestrians in urban settings.</p></details> |  |

Although the specifications for transmitting and receiving AIS messages are fixed, it is well known that technical inaccuracies and lacking seafarer compliance lead to severe data quality impairment. This paper proposes an adaptable, data-driven, $\alpha$-quantile-based framework for decoding, constructing, splitting, and assessing trajectories from raw AIS records to improve transparency in AIS data mining. Results indicate the proposed filtering algorithm robustly extracts clean, long, and uninterrupted trajectories for further processing.

| **[Simultaneous Trajectory Optimization and Contact Selection for Contact-rich Manipulation with High-Fidelity Geometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16976v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contact-implicit trajectory optimization (CITO) is an effective method to plan complex trajectories for various contact-rich systems including manipulation and locomotion. CITO formulates a mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC) that enforces that contact forces must be zero when points are not in contact. However, MPCC solve times increase steeply with the number of allowable points of contact, which limits CITO's applicability to problems in which only a few, simple geometries are allowed to make contact. This paper introduces simultaneous trajectory optimization and contact selection (STOCS), as an extension of CITO that overcomes this limitation. The innovation of STOCS is to identify salient contact points and times inside the iterative trajectory optimization process. This effectively reduces the number of variables and constraints in each MPCC invocation. The STOCS framework, instantiated with key contact identification subroutines, renders the optimization of manipulation trajectories computationally tractable even for high-fidelity geometries consisting of tens of thousands of vertices.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2306.06465</p></details> |
| **[Synthetic Trajectory Generation Through Convolutional Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16938v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Location trajectories provide valuable insights for applications from urban planning to pandemic control. However, mobility data can also reveal sensitive information about individuals, such as political opinions, religious beliefs, or sexual orientations. Existing privacy-preserving approaches for publishing this data face a significant utility-privacy trade-off. Releasing synthetic trajectory data generated through deep learning offers a promising solution. Due to the trajectories' sequential nature, most existing models are based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, research in generative adversarial networks (GANs) largely employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image generation. This discrepancy raises the question of whether advances in computer vision can be applied to trajectory generation. In this work, we introduce a Reversible Trajectory-to-CNN Transformation (RTCT) that adapts trajectories into a format suitable for CNN-based models. We integrated this transformation with the well-known DCGAN in a proof-of-concept (PoC) and evaluated its performance against an RNN-based trajectory GAN using four metrics across two datasets. The PoC was superior in capturing spatial distributions compared to the RNN model but had difficulty replicating sequential and temporal properties. Although the PoC's utility is not sufficient for practical applications, the results demonstrate the transformation's potential to facilitate the use of CNNs for trajectory generation, opening up avenues for future research. To support continued research, all source code has been made available under an open-source license.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Privacy, Security & Trust (PST 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Guaranteed Trajectory Tracking under Learned Dynamics with Contraction Metrics and Disturbance Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08222v5)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an approach to trajectory-centric learning control based on contraction metrics and disturbance estimation for nonlinear systems subject to matched uncertainties. The approach uses deep neural networks to learn uncertain dynamics while still providing guarantees of transient tracking performance throughout the learning phase. Within the proposed approach, a disturbance estimation law is adopted to estimate the pointwise value of the uncertainty, with pre-computable estimation error bounds (EEBs). The learned dynamics, the estimated disturbances, and the EEBs are then incorporated in a robust Riemann energy condition to compute the control law that guarantees exponential convergence of actual trajectories to desired ones throughout the learning phase, even when the learned model is poor. On the other hand, with improved accuracy, the learned model can help improve the robustness of the tracking controller, e.g., against input delays, and can be incorporated to plan better trajectories with improved performance, e.g., lower energy consumption and shorter travel time.The proposed framework is validated on a planar quadrotor example.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

Multimodal trajectory prediction enhances decision-making by considering multiple possible future trajectories based on diverse sources of environmental data. In this approach, we leverage ResNet-50 to extract image features from high-definition map data and use IMU sensor data to calculate speed, acceleration, and yaw rate. A temporal probabilistic network is employed to compute potential trajectories, selecting the most accurate and highly probable trajectory paths. This method integrates HD map data to improve the robustness and reliability of trajectory predictions for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |
| **[PateGail: A Privacy-Preserving Mobility Trajectory Generator with Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16729v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating human mobility trajectories is of great importance to solve the lack of large-scale trajectory data in numerous applications, which is caused by privacy concerns. However, existing mobility trajectory generation methods still require real-world human trajectories centrally collected as the training data, where there exists an inescapable risk of privacy leakage. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we propose PateGail, a privacy-preserving imitation learning model to generate mobility trajectories, which utilizes the powerful generative adversary imitation learning model to simulate the decision-making process of humans. Further, in order to protect user privacy, we train this model collectively based on decentralized mobility data stored in user devices, where personal discriminators are trained locally to distinguish and reward the real and generated human trajectories. In the training process, only the generated trajectories and their rewards obtained based on personal discriminators are shared between the server and devices, whose privacy is further preserved by our proposed perturbation mechanisms with theoretical proof to satisfy differential privacy. Further, to better model the human decision-making process, we propose a novel aggregation mechanism of the rewards obtained from personal discriminators. We theoretically prove that under the reward obtained based on the aggregation mechanism, our proposed model maximizes the lower bound of the discounted total rewards of users. Extensive experiments show that the trajectories generated by our model are able to resemble real-world trajectories in terms of five key statistical metrics, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms by over 48.03%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the synthetic trajectories are able to efficiently support practical applications, including mobility prediction and location recommendation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Stein Variational Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12110v3)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Constrained Stein Variational Trajectory Optimization (CSVTO), an algorithm for performing trajectory optimization with constraints on a set of trajectories in parallel. We frame constrained trajectory optimization as a novel form of constrained functional minimization over trajectory distributions, which avoids treating the constraints as a penalty in the objective and allows us to generate diverse sets of constraint-satisfying trajectories. Our method uses Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) to find a set of particles that approximates a distribution over low-cost trajectories while obeying constraints. CSVTO is applicable to problems with differentiable equality and inequality constraints and includes a novel particle re-sampling step to escape local minima. By explicitly generating diverse sets of trajectories, CSVTO is better able to avoid poor local minima and is more robust to initialization. We demonstrate that CSVTO outperforms baselines in challenging highly-constrained tasks, such as a 7DoF wrench manipulation task, where CSVTO outperforms all baselines both in success and constraint satisfaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Biological knowledge suggests that it may be best to describe complex diseases at the level of underlying pathways, which may interact with one another. We propose a Bayesian approach that allows for characterising such correlation among different pathways through Dependent Gaussian Processes (DGP) and mapping the observed high-dimensional gene expression trajectories into unobserved low-dimensional pathway expression trajectories via Bayesian Sparse Factor Analysis. Our proposal is the first attempt to relax the classical assumption of independent factors for longitudinal data and has demonstrated a superior performance in recovering the shape of pathway expression trajectories, revealing the relationships between genes and pathways, and predicting gene expressions (closer point estimates and narrower predictive intervals), as demonstrated through simulations and real data analysis. To fit the model, we propose a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM) scheme that can be implemented conveniently by combining a standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler and an R package GPFDA (Konzen and others, 2021), which returns the maximum likelihood estimates of DGP hyperparameters. The modular structure of MCEM makes it generalizable to other complex models involving the DGP model component. Our R package DGP4LCF that implements the proposed approach is available on CRAN.</p></details> |  |

However, configuring the skills' parameters for a specific task remains a manual and time-consuming endeavor. Existing approaches for learning or optimizing these parameters often require numerous real-world executions or do not work in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose MuTT, a novel encoder-decoder transformer architecture designed to predict environment-aware executions of robot skills by integrating vision, trajectory, and robot skill parameters. Notably, we pioneer the fusion of vision and trajectory, introducing a novel trajectory projection. Furthermore, we illustrate MuTT's efficacy as a predictor when combined with a model-based robot skill optimizer. This approach facilitates the optimization of robot skill parameters for the current environment, without the need for real-world executions during optimization. Designed for compatibility with any representation of robot skills, MuTT demonstrates its versatility across three comprehensive experiments, showcasing superior performance across two different skill representations.</p></details> |  |

To study this, structured clinical variables from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) data have traditionally been employed by many researchers. Presently, Natural Language Processing models have received great attention in clinical research which expanded the possibilities of using clinical narratives. In this paper, we propose a systematic methodology for developing sepsis prognostic pathways derived from clinical notes, focusing on diverse patient subgroups identified by exploring comorbidities associated with sepsis and generating explanations of these subgroups using SHAP. The extracted prognostic pathways of these subgroups provide valuable insights into the dynamic trajectories of sepsis severity over time. Visualizing these pathways sheds light on the likelihood and direction of disease progression across various contexts and reveals patterns and pivotal factors or biomarkers influencing the transition between sepsis stages, whether toward deterioration or improvement.

Some leading methods in this domain prioritize long-range matching, involving the unrolling of training trajectories with a fixed number of steps (NS) on the synthetic dataset to align with various expert training trajectories. However, traditional long-range matching methods possess an overfitting-like problem, the fixed step size NS forces synthetic dataset to distortedly conform seen expert training trajectories, resulting in a loss of generality-especially to those from unencountered architecture. We refer to this as the Accumulated Mismatching Problem (AMP), and propose a new approach, Automatic Training Trajectories (ATT), which dynamically and adaptively adjusts trajectory length NS to address the AMP. Our method outperforms existing methods particularly in tests involving cross-architectures.

The survey progresses to detail the leading algorithms for measuring vessel trajectory similarity and the main clustering techniques used in the field today. Furthermore, the various applications of trajectory clustering within the maritime context are explored. Finally, the paper evaluates the effectiveness of different algorithm combinations and pre-processing methods through experimental analysis, focusing on their impact on the performance of distance-based trajectory clustering algorithms.

Although numerous well-known benchmarks exist to evaluate model performance, they increasingly have insufficient headroom. As such, there is a pressing need for a new generation of benchmarks challenging enough for the next generation of LMMs. One area that LMMs show potential is graph analysis, specifically, the tasks an analyst might typically perform when interpreting figures such as estimating the mean, intercepts or correlations of functions and data series. In this work, we introduce GRAB, a graph analysis benchmark, fit for current and future frontier LMMs. Our benchmark is entirely synthetic, ensuring high-quality, noise-free questions. GRAB is comprised of 2170 questions, covering four tasks and 23 graph properties. We evaluate 20 LMMs on GRAB, finding it to be a challenging benchmark, with the highest performing model attaining a score of just 21.7%. Finally, we conduct various ablations to investigate where the models succeed and struggle. We release GRAB to encourage progress in this important, growing domain.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we present Story3D-Agent, a pioneering approach that leverages the capabilities of LLMs to transform provided narratives into 3D-rendered visualizations. By integrating procedural modeling, our approach enables precise control over multi-character actions and motions, as well as diverse decorative elements, ensuring the long-range and dynamic 3D representation.

| **[EE-MLLM: A Data-Efficient and Compute-Efficient Multimodal Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11795v1)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of multimodal research, numerous studies leverage substantial image-text pairs to conduct modal alignment learning, transforming Large Language Models (LLMs) into Multimodal LLMs and excelling in a variety of visual-language tasks. The prevailing methodologies primarily fall into two categories: self-attention-based and cross-attention-based methods. While self-attention-based methods offer superior data efficiency due to their simple MLP architecture, they often suffer from lower computational efficiency due to concatenating visual and textual tokens as input for LLM. Conversely, cross-attention-based methods, although less data-efficient due to additional learnable parameters, exhibit higher computational efficiency by avoiding long sequence input for LLM. To address these trade-offs, we introduce the Data-Efficient and Compute-Efficient Multimodal Large Language Model (EE-MLLM). Without introducing additional modules or learnable parameters, EE-MLLM achieves both data and compute efficiency. Specifically, we modify the original self-attention mechanism in MLLM to a composite attention mechanism. This mechanism has two key characteristics: 1) Eliminating the computational overhead of self-attention within visual tokens to achieve compute efficiency, and 2) Reusing the weights on each layer of LLM to facilitate effective modality alignment between vision and language for data efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of EE-MLLM across a range of benchmarks, including general-purpose datasets like MMBench and SeedBench, as well as fine-grained tasks such as TextVQA and DocVQA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personality Alignment of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11779v1)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current methods for aligning large language models (LLMs) typically aim to reflect general human values and behaviors, but they often fail to capture the unique characteristics and preferences of individual users. To address this gap, we introduce the concept of Personality Alignment. This approach tailors LLMs' responses and decisions to match the specific preferences of individual users or closely related groups. Inspired by psychometrics, we created the Personality Alignment with Personality Inventories (PAPI) dataset, which includes data from 300,000 real subjects, each providing behavioral preferences based on the Big Five Personality Factors. This dataset allows us to quantitatively evaluate the extent to which LLMs can align with each subject's behavioral patterns. Recognizing the challenges of personality alignments: such as limited personal data, diverse preferences, and scalability requirements: we developed an activation intervention optimization method. This method enhances LLMs' ability to efficiently align with individual behavioral preferences using minimal data and computational resources. Remarkably, our method, PAS, achieves superior performance while requiring only 1/5 of the optimization time compared to DPO, offering practical value for personality alignment. Our work paves the way for future AI systems to make decisions and reason in truly personality ways, enhancing the relevance and meaning of AI interactions for each user and advancing human-centered artificial intelligence.The code has released in \url{https://github.com/zhu-minjun/PAlign}.</p></details> |  |

However, designing and setting up interfaces for human-robot collaboration is challenging, requiring the integration of multiple components, from perception and robot task control to the hardware itself. Frequently, this leads to highly customized solutions that rely on large amounts of costly training data, diverging from the ideal of flexible and general interfaces that empower robots to perceive and adapt to unstructured environments where they can naturally collaborate with humans. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents the Detection-Robot Management GPT (D-RMGPT), a robot-assisted assembly planner based on Large Multimodal Models (LMM). This system can assist inexperienced operators in assembly tasks without requiring any markers or previous training. D-RMGPT is composed of DetGPT-V and R-ManGPT. DetGPT-V, based on GPT-4V(vision), perceives the surrounding environment through one-shot analysis of prompted images of the current assembly stage and the list of components to be assembled. It identifies which components have already been assembled by analysing their features and assembly requirements. R-ManGPT, based on GPT-4, plans the next component to be assembled and generates the robot's discrete actions to deliver it to the human co-worker. Experimental tests on assembling a toy aircraft demonstrated that D-RMGPT is flexible and intuitive to use, achieving an assembly success rate of 83% while reducing the assembly time for inexperienced operators by 33% compared to the manual process. http://robotics-and-ai.github.io/LMMmodels/</p></details> |  |

While large Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, deploying them in real-world scenarios necessitates a comparable geometric understanding in visual perception. In this work, we focus on the geometric comprehension of these models; specifically targeting the depths and heights of objects within a scene. Our observations reveal that, although VLMs excel in basic geometric properties perception such as shape and size, they encounter significant challenges in reasoning about the depth and height of objects. To address this, we introduce a suite of benchmark datasets encompassing Synthetic 2D, Synthetic 3D, and Real-World scenarios to rigorously evaluate these aspects. We benchmark 17 state-of-the-art VLMs using these datasets and find that they consistently struggle with both depth and height perception. Our key insights include detailed analyses of the shortcomings in depth and height reasoning capabilities of VLMs and the inherent bias present in these models. This study aims to pave the way for the development of VLMs with enhanced geometric understanding, crucial for real-world applications.

Quantization not only reduces model size, but has also been shown to yield substantial speedups for single-user inference, due to reduced memory movement, with low accuracy impact. Yet, it remains open whether speedups are achievable also in \emph{batched} settings with multiple parallel clients, which are highly relevant for practical serving. It is unclear whether GPU kernels can be designed to remain practically memory-bound, while supporting the substantially increased compute requirements of batched workloads. This paper resolves this question positively by describing the design of Mixed-precision Auto-Regressive LINear kernels, called MARLIN. Concretely, given a model whose weights are compressed via quantization to, e.g., 4 bits per element, MARLIN shows that batchsizes up to 16-32 can be supported with close to maximum ($4\times$) quantization speedup, and larger batchsizes up to 64-128 with gradually decreasing, but still significant, acceleration. MARLIN accomplishes this via a combination of techniques, such as asynchronous memory access, complex task scheduling and pipelining, and bespoke quantization support. Our experiments show that MARLIN's near-optimal performance on individual LLM layers across different scenarios can also lead to end-to-end LLM inference speedups (of up to $2.8\times$) when integrated with the popular vLLM serving engine. Finally, MARLIN is extensible to further compression techniques, like NVIDIA 2:4 sparsity, leading to additional speedups.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Detection of Toxic Prompts in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11727v1)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini have significantly advanced natural language processing, enabling various applications such as chatbots and automated content generation. However, these models can be exploited by malicious individuals who craft toxic prompts to elicit harmful or unethical responses. These individuals often employ jailbreaking techniques to bypass safety mechanisms, highlighting the need for robust toxic prompt detection methods. Existing detection techniques, both blackbox and whitebox, face challenges related to the diversity of toxic prompts, scalability, and computational efficiency. In response, we propose ToxicDetector, a lightweight greybox method designed to efficiently detect toxic prompts in LLMs. ToxicDetector leverages LLMs to create toxic concept prompts, uses embedding vectors to form feature vectors, and employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier for prompt classification. Our evaluation on various versions of the LLama models, Gemma-2, and multiple datasets demonstrates that ToxicDetector achieves a high accuracy of 96.39\% and a low false positive rate of 2.00\%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, ToxicDetector's processing time of 0.0780 seconds per prompt makes it highly suitable for real-time applications. ToxicDetector achieves high accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, making it a practical method for toxic prompt detection in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 39th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging Large Language Models for Enhancing the Understandability of Generated Unit Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11710v1)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated unit test generators, particularly search-based software testing tools like EvoSuite, are capable of generating tests with high coverage. Although these generators alleviate the burden of writing unit tests, they often pose challenges for software engineers in terms of understanding the generated tests. To address this, we introduce UTGen, which combines search-based software testing and large language models to enhance the understandability of automatically generated test cases. We achieve this enhancement through contextualizing test data, improving identifier naming, and adding descriptive comments. Through a controlled experiment with 32 participants from both academia and industry, we investigate how the understandability of unit tests affects a software engineer's ability to perform bug-fixing tasks. We selected bug-fixing to simulate a real-world scenario that emphasizes the importance of understandable test cases. We observe that participants working on assignments with UTGen test cases fix up to 33% more bugs and use up to 20% less time when compared to baseline test cases. From the post-test questionnaire, we gathered that participants found that enhanced test names, test data, and variable names improved their bug-fixing process.</p></details> | <details><summary>**Not...</summary><p>**Note:** This paper has been accepted for presentation at the 47th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2025) - Research Track</p></details> |
| **[VulDetectBench: Evaluating the Deep Capability of Vulnerability Detection with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07595v4)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have training corpora containing large amounts of program code, greatly improving the model's code comprehension and generation capabilities. However, sound comprehensive research on detecting program vulnerabilities, a more specific task related to code, and evaluating the performance of LLMs in this more specialized scenario is still lacking. To address common challenges in vulnerability analysis, our study introduces a new benchmark, VulDetectBench, specifically designed to assess the vulnerability detection capabilities of LLMs. The benchmark comprehensively evaluates LLM's ability to identify, classify, and locate vulnerabilities through five tasks of increasing difficulty. We evaluate the performance of 17 models (both open- and closed-source) and find that while existing models can achieve over 80% accuracy on tasks related to vulnerability identification and classification, they still fall short on specific, more detailed vulnerability analysis tasks, with less than 30% accuracy, making it difficult to provide valuable auxiliary information for professional vulnerability mining. Our benchmark effectively evaluates the capabilities of various LLMs at different levels in the specific task of vulnerability detection, providing a foundation for future research and improvements in this critical area of code security. VulDetectBench is publicly available at https://github.com/Sweetaroo/VulDetectBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models in Mental Health Care: a Scoping Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02984v2)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of large language models (LLMs) in mental health care is an emerging field. There is a need to systematically review the application outcomes and delineate the advantages and limitations in clinical settings. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the use of LLMs in mental health care, assessing their efficacy, challenges, and potential for future applications. A systematic search was conducted across multiple databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, arXiv, medRxiv, and PsyArXiv in November 2023. All forms of original research, peer-reviewed or not, published or disseminated between October 1, 2019, and December 2, 2023, are included without language restrictions if they used LLMs developed after T5 and directly addressed research questions in mental health care settings. From an initial pool of 313 articles, 34 met the inclusion criteria based on their relevance to LLM application in mental health care and the robustness of reported outcomes. Diverse applications of LLMs in mental health care are identified, including diagnosis, therapy, patient engagement enhancement, etc. Key challenges include data availability and reliability, nuanced handling of mental states, and effective evaluation methods. Despite successes in accuracy and accessibility improvement, gaps in clinical applicability and ethical considerations were evident, pointing to the need for robust data, standardized evaluations, and interdisciplinary collaboration. LLMs hold substantial promise for enhancing mental health care. For their full potential to be realized, emphasis must be placed on developing robust datasets, development and evaluation frameworks, ethical guidelines, and interdisciplinary collaborations to address current limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[ML-Bench: Evaluating Large Language Models and Agents for Machine Learning Tasks on Repository-Level Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09835v5)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 achieving impressive results in function-level code generation, they struggle with repository-scale code understanding (e.g., coming up with the right arguments for calling routines), requiring a deeper comprehension of complex file interactions. Also, recently, people have developed LLM agents that attempt to interact with repository code (e.g., compiling and evaluating its execution), prompting the need to evaluate their performance. These gaps have motivated our development of ML-Bench, a benchmark rooted in real-world programming applications that leverage existing code repositories to perform tasks. Addressing the need for LLMs to interpret long code contexts and translate instructions into precise, executable scripts, ML-Bench encompasses annotated 9,641 examples across 18 GitHub repositories, challenging LLMs to accommodate user-specified arguments and documentation intricacies effectively. To evaluate both LLMs and AI agents, two setups are employed: ML-LLM-Bench for assessing LLMs' text-to-code conversion within a predefined deployment environment, and ML-Agent-Bench for testing autonomous agents in an end-to-end task execution within a Linux sandbox environment. Our findings indicate that while GPT-4o leads with a Pass@5 rate surpassing 50%, there remains significant scope for improvement, highlighted by issues such as hallucinated outputs and difficulties with bash script generation. Notably, in the more demanding ML-Agent-Bench, GPT-4o achieves a 76.47% success rate, reflecting the efficacy of iterative action and feedback in complex task resolution. Our code, dataset, and models are available at https://github.com/gersteinlab/ML-bench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Watch Out for Your Guidance on Generation! Exploring Conditional Backdoor Attacks against Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14795v4)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mainstream backdoor attacks on large language models (LLMs) typically set a fixed trigger in the input instance and specific responses for triggered queries. However, the fixed trigger setting (e.g., unusual words) may be easily detected by human detection, limiting the effectiveness and practicality in real-world scenarios. To enhance the stealthiness of backdoor activation, we present a new poisoning paradigm against LLMs triggered by specifying generation conditions, which are commonly adopted strategies by users during model inference. The poisoned model performs normally for output under normal/other generation conditions, while becomes harmful for output under target generation conditions. To achieve this objective, we introduce BrieFool, an efficient attack framework. It leverages the characteristics of generation conditions by efficient instruction sampling and poisoning data generation, thereby influencing the behavior of LLMs under target conditions. Our attack can be generally divided into two types with different targets: Safety unalignment attack and Ability degradation attack. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that BrieFool is effective across safety domains and ability domains, achieving higher success rates than baseline methods, with 94.3 % on GPT-3.5-turbo</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models are Good Attackers: Efficient and Stealthy Textual Backdoor Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11587v1)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the burgeoning advancements in the field of natural language processing (NLP), the demand for training data has increased significantly. To save costs, it has become common for users and businesses to outsource the labor-intensive task of data collection to third-party entities. Unfortunately, recent research has unveiled the inherent risk associated with this practice, particularly in exposing NLP systems to potential backdoor attacks. Specifically, these attacks enable malicious control over the behavior of a trained model by poisoning a small portion of the training data. Unlike backdoor attacks in computer vision, textual backdoor attacks impose stringent requirements for attack stealthiness. However, existing attack methods meet significant trade-off between effectiveness and stealthiness, largely due to the high information entropy inherent in textual data. In this paper, we introduce the Efficient and Stealthy Textual backdoor attack method, EST-Bad, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Our EST-Bad encompasses three core strategies: optimizing the inherent flaw of models as the trigger, stealthily injecting triggers with LLMs, and meticulously selecting the most impactful samples for backdoor injection. Through the integration of these techniques, EST-Bad demonstrates an efficient achievement of competitive attack performance while maintaining superior stealthiness compared to prior methods across various text classifier datasets.</p></details> | Under Review |

The emergence of LLM has introduced innovative methodologies across diverse fields, including the natural sciences. Researchers aim to implement automated, concurrent process driven by LLM to supplant conventional manual, repetitive and labor-intensive work. In the domain of spectral analysis and detection, it is imperative for researchers to autonomously acquire pertinent knowledge across various research objects, which encompasses the spectroscopic techniques and the chemometric methods that are employed in experiments and analysis. Paradoxically, despite the recognition of spectroscopic detection as an effective analytical method, the fundamental process of knowledge retrieval remains both time-intensive and repetitive. In response to this challenge, we first introduced the Spectral Detection and Analysis Based Paper(SDAAP) dataset, which is the first open-source textual knowledge dataset for spectral analysis and detection and contains annotated literature data as well as corresponding knowledge instruction data. Subsequently, we also designed an automated Q\&A framework based on the SDAAP dataset, which can retrieve relevant knowledge and generate high-quality responses by extracting entities in the input as retrieval parameters. It is worth noting that: within this framework, LLM is only used as a tool to provide generalizability, while RAG technique is used to accurately capture the source of the knowledge.This approach not only improves the quality of the generated responses, but also ensures the traceability of the knowledge. Experimental results show that our framework generates responses with more reliable expertise compared to the baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages,10 figures,3 tables</p></details> |

Through meticulously designed prompt engineering strategies, the model is guided to generate diverse questions, which are then comprehensively evaluated by domain experts. The evaluation dimensions include the Hitting(the degree of alignment with teaching content), Fitting (the degree of embodiment of core competencies), Clarity (the explicitness of question descriptions), and Willing to use (the teacher's willingness to use the question in teaching). The results indicate that ChatGLM outperforms human-generated questions in terms of clarity and teachers' willingness to use, although there is no significant difference in hit rate and fit. This finding suggests that ChatGLM has the potential to enhance the efficiency of question generation and alleviate the burden on teachers, providing a new perspective for the future development of educational assessment systems. Future research could explore further optimizations to the ChatGLM model to maintain high fit and hit rates while improving the clarity of questions and teachers' willingness to use them.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional RS relies on collaborative signals, which lacks semantic understanding to real-time scenes. We also noticed that a major challenge in utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for practical recommendation purposes is their efficiency in dealing with long text input. To break through the problems above, we propose Large Language Model Aided Real-time Scene Recommendation(LARR), adopt LLMs for semantic understanding, utilizing real-time scene information in RS without requiring LLM to process the entire real-time scene text directly, thereby enhancing the efficiency of LLM-based CTR modeling. Specifically, recommendation domain-specific knowledge is injected into LLM and then RS employs an aggregation encoder to build real-time scene information from separate LLM's outputs. Firstly, a LLM is continual pretrained on corpus built from recommendation data with the aid of special tokens. Subsequently, the LLM is fine-tuned via contrastive learning on three kinds of sample construction strategies. Through this step, LLM is transformed into a text embedding model. Finally, LLM's separate outputs for different scene features are aggregated by an encoder, aligning to collaborative signals in RS, enhancing the performance of recommendation model.</p></details> |  |

Although the functionality of a model is inherently tied to its parameters, a systematic method for exploring the connections between the parameters and the functionality are lacking. Models sharing similar structure and parameter counts exhibit significant performance disparities across various tasks, prompting investigations into the varying patterns that govern their performance. We adopted a mutagenesis screen approach inspired by the methods used in biological studies, to investigate Llama2-7b and Zephyr. This technique involved mutating elements within the models' matrices to their maximum or minimum values to examine the relationship between model parameters and their functionalities. Our research uncovered multiple levels of fine structures within both models. Many matrices showed a mixture of maximum and minimum mutations following mutagenesis, but others were predominantly sensitive to one type. Notably, mutations that produced phenotypes, especially those with severe outcomes, tended to cluster along axes. Additionally, the location of maximum and minimum mutations often displayed a complementary pattern on matrix in both models, with the Gate matrix showing a unique two-dimensional asymmetry after rearrangement. In Zephyr, certain mutations consistently resulted in poetic or conversational rather than descriptive outputs. These "writer" mutations grouped according to the high-frequency initial word of the output, with a marked tendency to share the row coordinate even when they are in different matrices. Our findings affirm that the mutagenesis screen is an effective tool for deciphering the complexities of large language models and identifying unexpected ways to expand their potential, providing deeper insights into the foundational aspects of AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, supplementary material available online</p></details> |

However, traditional Transformer architectures incur significant overhead due to their secondary computational complexity. To address this issue, we introduce ML-Mamba, a multimodal language model, which utilizes the latest and efficient Mamba-2 model for inference. Mamba-2 is known for its linear scalability and fast processing of long sequences. We replace the Transformer-based backbone with a pre-trained Mamba-2 model and explore methods for integrating 2D visual selective scanning mechanisms into multimodal learning while also trying various visual encoders and Mamba-2 model variants. Our extensive experiments in various multimodal benchmark tests demonstrate the competitive performance of ML-Mamba and highlight the potential of state space models in multimodal tasks. The experimental results show that: (1) we empirically explore how to effectively apply the 2D vision selective scan mechanism for multimodal learning. We propose a novel multimodal connector called the Mamba-2 Scan Connector (MSC), which enhances representational capabilities. (2) ML-Mamba achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods such as TinyLaVA and MobileVLM v2 through its linear sequential modeling while faster inference speed; (3) Compared to multimodal models utilizing Mamba-1, the Mamba-2-based ML-Mamba exhibits superior inference performance and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

These domain-specific and labor-intensive modules are limited in addressing emerging tasks in real-world settings. Here, we present LLM^3, a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based TAMP framework featuring a domain-independent interface. Specifically, we leverage the powerful reasoning and planning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs to propose symbolic action sequences and select continuous action parameters for motion planning. Crucially, LLM^3 incorporates motion planning feedback through prompting, allowing the LLM to iteratively refine its proposals by reasoning about motion failure. Consequently, LLM^3 interfaces between task planning and motion planning, alleviating the intricate design process of handling domain-specific messages between them. Through a series of simulations in a box-packing domain, we quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM^3 in solving TAMP problems and the efficiency in selecting action parameters. Ablation studies underscore the significant contribution of motion failure reasoning to the success of LLM^3. Furthermore, we conduct qualitative experiments on a physical manipulator, demonstrating the practical applicability of our approach in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>IROS ...</summary><p>IROS 2024.

The entrywise maximum norm is equally important but is significantly weaker for large tensors, making the estimates obtained via the Frobenius norm and norm equivalence pessimistic or even meaningless. In this article, we derive a direct estimate of the entrywise approximation error that is applicable in some of these cases. The estimate is given in terms of the higher-order generalization of the matrix factorization norm, and its proof is based on the tensor-structured Hanson-Wright inequality. The theoretical results are accompanied with numerical experiments carried out with the method of alternating projections.</p></details> | Major revision |

While they provide valuable insights and assist in problem-solving, they can also potentially serve as a resource for malicious activities. Implementing safety alignment could mitigate the risk of LLMs generating harmful responses. We argue that: even when an LLM appears to successfully block harmful queries, there may still be hidden vulnerabilities that could act as ticking time bombs. To identify these underlying weaknesses, we propose to use a cost value model as both a detector and an attacker. Trained on external or self-generated harmful datasets, the cost value model could successfully influence the original safe LLM to output toxic content in decoding process. For instance, LLaMA-2-chat 7B outputs 39.18% concrete toxic content, along with only 22.16% refusals without any harmful suffixes. These potential weaknesses can then be exploited via prompt optimization such as soft prompts on images. We name this decoding strategy: Jailbreak Value Decoding (JVD), emphasizing that seemingly secure LLMs may not be as safe as we initially believe. They could be used to gather harmful data or launch covert attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoE-LPR: Multilingual Extension of Large Language Models through Mixture-of-Experts with Language Priors Routing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11396v1)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are often English-centric due to the disproportionate distribution of languages in their pre-training data. Enhancing non-English language capabilities through post-pretraining often results in catastrophic forgetting of the ability of original languages. Previous methods either achieve good expansion with severe forgetting or slight forgetting with poor expansion, indicating the challenge of balancing language expansion while preventing forgetting. In this paper, we propose a method called MoE-LPR (Mixture-of-Experts with Language Priors Routing) to alleviate this problem. MoE-LPR employs a two-stage training approach to enhance the multilingual capability. First, the model is post-pretrained into a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture by upcycling, where all the original parameters are frozen and new experts are added. In this stage, we focus improving the ability on expanded languages, without using any original language data. Then, the model reviews the knowledge of the original languages with replay data amounting to less than 1% of post-pretraining, where we incorporate language priors routing to better recover the abilities of the original languages. Evaluations on multiple benchmarks show that MoE-LPR outperforms other post-pretraining methods. Freezing original parameters preserves original language knowledge while adding new experts preserves the learning ability. Reviewing with LPR enables effective utilization of multilingual knowledge within the parameters. Additionally, the MoE architecture maintains the same inference overhead while increasing total model parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate MoE-LPR's effectiveness in improving expanded languages and preserving original language proficiency with superior scalability.

However, these techniques often rely on ReLU activation functions or require additional parameters and training to maintain performance. This paper introduces a training-free Threshold-based Dynamic Activation(TDA) method that leverage sequence information to exploit the inherent sparsity of models across various architectures. This method is designed to accelerate generation speed by 18-25\% without significantly compromising task performance, thereby addressing the limitations of existing DA techniques. Moreover, we delve into the root causes of LLM sparsity and theoretically analyze two of its critical features: history-related activation uncertainty and semantic-irrelevant activation inertia. Our comprehensive analyses not only provide a robust theoretical foundation for DA methods but also offer valuable insights to guide future research in optimizing LLMs for greater efficiency and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flexora: Flexible Low Rank Adaptation for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10774v2)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are driving advancements in artificial intelligence by increasing the scale of model parameters, which has significantly enhanced generalization ability and unlocked new capabilities in practice. However, their performance in specific downstream tasks is usually hindered by their knowledge boundaries on these tasks. Thus, fine-tuning techniques, especially the widely used Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method, have been introduced to expand the boundaries on these tasks, whereas LoRA would underperform on certain tasks owing to its potential overfitting on these tasks. To overcome this overfitting and improve the performance of LoRA, we propose the flexible low rank adaptation (Flexora) method to automatically and flexibly select the most important layers needing to be fine-tuned to achieve the best performance on different downstream tasks. Specifically, Flexora firstly frames this layer selection problem as a well-defined hyperparameter optimization (HPO) problem, then addresses it using the unrolled differentiation (UD) method, and finally selects the most useful layers based on the optimized hyperparameters. Our extensive experiments on many pretrained models and natural language tasks show that Flexora is able to consistently improve over the existing baselines, indicating the effectiveness of our Flexora in practice. We additionally provide insightful theoretical results and many ablation studies to deliver a comprehensive understanding of our Flexora.</p></details> | 29 pages, 13 figures |

Existing studies, though have explored various aspects of VQA but somewhat ignored this particular attribute. This paper aims to bridge the research gap by contributing a comprehensive dataset, called UNK-VQA. The dataset is specifically designed to address the challenge of questions that models do not know. To this end, we first augment the existing data via deliberate perturbations on either the image or question. In specific, we carefully ensure that the question-image semantics remain close to the original unperturbed distribution. By this means, the identification of unanswerable questions becomes challenging, setting our dataset apart from others that involve mere image replacement. We then extensively evaluate the zero- and few-shot performance of several emerging multi-modal large models and discover their significant limitations when applied to our dataset. Additionally, we also propose a straightforward method to tackle these unanswerable questions. This dataset, we believe, will serve as a valuable benchmark for enhancing the abstention capability of VQA models, thereby leading to increased trustworthiness of AI systems. We have made the dataset (https://github.com/guoyang9/UNK-VQA) available to facilitate further exploration in this area.</p></details> | Accepted by TPAMI |

In TNAS, architectural knowledge accumulated in previous search processes is reused to warm up the architecture search for new tasks. However, existing TNAS methods still search in an extensive search space, necessitating the evaluation of numerous architectures. To overcome this challenge, this work proposes a novel transfer paradigm, i.e., design principle transfer. In this work, the linguistic description of various structural components' effects on architectural performance is termed design principles. They are learned from established architectures and then can be reused to reduce the search space by discarding unpromising architectures. Searching in the refined search space can boost both the search performance and efficiency for new NAS tasks. To this end, a large language model (LLM)-assisted design principle transfer (LAPT) framework is devised. In LAPT, LLM is applied to automatically reason the design principles from a set of given architectures, and then a principle adaptation method is applied to refine these principles progressively based on the new search results. Experimental results show that LAPT can beat the state-of-the-art TNAS methods on most tasks and achieve comparable performance on others.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Evaluating Large Language Models on Sarcasm Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11319v1)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of large language models (LLMs), the task of ``System I''~-~the fast, unconscious, and intuitive tasks, e.g., sentiment analysis, text classification, etc., have been argued to be successfully solved. However, sarcasm, as a subtle linguistic phenomenon, often employs rhetorical devices like hyperbole and figuration to convey true sentiments and intentions, involving a higher level of abstraction than sentiment analysis. There is growing concern that the argument about LLMs' success may not be fully tenable when considering sarcasm understanding. To address this question, we select eleven SOTA LLMs and eight SOTA pre-trained language models (PLMs) and present comprehensive evaluations on six widely used benchmark datasets through different prompting approaches, i.e., zero-shot input/output (IO) prompting, few-shot IO prompting, chain of thought (CoT) prompting. Our results highlight three key findings: (1) current LLMs underperform supervised PLMs based sarcasm detection baselines across six sarcasm benchmarks. This suggests that significant efforts are still required to improve LLMs' understanding of human sarcasm. (2) GPT-4 consistently and significantly outperforms other LLMs across various prompting methods, with an average improvement of 14.0\%$\uparrow$. Claude 3 and ChatGPT demonstrate the next best performance after GPT-4. (3) Few-shot IO prompting method outperforms the other two methods: zero-shot IO and few-shot CoT. The reason is that sarcasm detection, being a holistic, intuitive, and non-rational cognitive process, is argued not to adhere to step-by-step logical reasoning, making CoT less effective in understanding sarcasm compared to its effectiveness in mathematical reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, they pose challenges in producing prediction probabilities, which are essential for transparency and allowing clinicians to apply flexible probability thresholds in decision-making. While explicit prompt instructions can lead LLMs to provide prediction probability numbers through text generation, LLMs' limitations in numerical reasoning raise concerns about the reliability of these text-generated probabilities. To assess this reliability, we compared explicit probabilities derived from text generation to implicit probabilities calculated based on the likelihood of predicting the correct label token. Experimenting with six advanced open-source LLMs across five medical datasets, we found that the performance of explicit probabilities was consistently lower than implicit probabilities with respect to discrimination, precision, and recall. Moreover, these differences were enlarged on small LLMs and imbalanced datasets, emphasizing the need for cautious interpretation and applications, as well as further research into robust probability estimation methods for LLMs in clinical contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>58 pa...</summary><p>58 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables, Submitted to Nature Communication</p></details> |

In general, traditional methods based on data-matching are hindered by the impracticality of storing adequate visual records of global landmarks. Recently, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated the capability of geo-localization through Visual Question Answering (VQA), enabling a solution that does not require external geo-tagged image records. However, the performance of a single LVLM is still limited by its intrinsic knowledge and reasoning capabilities. Along this line, in this paper, we introduce a novel visual geo-localization framework called \name\ that integrates the inherent knowledge of multiple LVLM agents via inter-agent communication to achieve effective geo-localization of images. Furthermore, our framework employs a dynamic learning strategy to optimize the communication patterns among agents, reducing unnecessary discussions among agents and improving the efficiency of the framework. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we construct GeoGlobe, a novel dataset for visual geo-localization tasks. Extensive testing on the dataset demonstrates that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we propose a novel approach, InstructERC, to reformulate the ERC task from a discriminative framework to a generative framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). InstructERC makes three significant contributions: (1) it introduces a simple yet effective retrieval template module, which helps the model explicitly integrate multi-granularity dialogue supervision information. (2) We introduce two additional emotion alignment tasks, namely speaker identification and emotion prediction tasks, to implicitly model the dialogue role relationships and future emotional tendencies in conversations. (3) Pioneeringly, we unify emotion labels across benchmarks through the feeling wheel to fit real application scenarios. InstructERC still perform impressively on this unified dataset. Our LLM-based plugin framework significantly outperforms all previous models and achieves comprehensive SOTA on three commonly used ERC datasets. Extensive analysis of parameter-efficient and data-scaling experiments provides empirical guidance for applying it in practical scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, there is a growing concern as some users attempt to exploit these models for malicious purposes, including the synthesis of controlled substances and the propagation of disinformation. In an effort to mitigate such risks, the concept of "Alignment" technology has been developed. However, recent studies indicate that this alignment can be undermined using sophisticated prompt engineering or adversarial suffixes, a technique known as "Jailbreak." Our research takes cues from the human-like generate process of LLMs. We identify that while jailbreaking prompts may yield output logits similar to benign prompts, their initial embeddings within the model's latent space tend to be more analogous to those of malicious prompts. Leveraging this finding, we propose utilizing the early transformer outputs of LLMs as a means to detect malicious inputs, and terminate the generation immediately. Built upon this idea, we introduce a simple yet significant defense approach called EEG-Defender for LLMs. We conduct comprehensive experiments on ten jailbreak methods across three models. Our results demonstrate that EEG-Defender is capable of reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by a significant margin, roughly 85\% in comparison with 50\% for the present SOTAs, with minimal impact on the utility and effectiveness of LLMs.</p></details> | 19 pages, 7 figures |

However, the vast potential and remarkable capabilities of LLMs also raise new security and privacy concerns if they are exploited for nefarious purposes due to their open-endedness. For example, LLMs may be used to plagiarize or imitate writing, thereby infringing the copyright of the original content, or to create indiscriminate fake information based on a certain source text. In some cases, LLMs can even analyze text from the Internet to infer personal privacy. Unfortunately, previous text protection research could not foresee the emergence of powerful LLMs, rendering it no longer effective in this new context. To bridge this gap, we introduce Silent Guardian (SG), a text protection mechanism against LLMs, which allows LLMs to refuse to generate response when receiving protected text, preventing the malicious use of text from the source. Specifically, we first propose the concept of Truncation Protection Examples (TPE). By carefully modifying the text to be protected, TPE can induce LLMs to first sample the end token, thus directly terminating the interaction. In addition, to efficiently construct TPE in the discrete space of text data, we propose a novel optimization algorithm called Super Tailored Protection (STP), which is not only highly efficient but also maintains the semantic consistency of the text during the optimization process. The comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that SG can effectively protect the target text under various configurations and achieve almost 100% protection success rate in some cases. Notably, SG also exhibits relatively good transferability and robustness, making its application in practical scenarios possible. Our code is available at https://github.com/weiyezhimeng/Silent-Guardian.</p></details> |  |
| **[Making Large Vision Language Models to be Good Few-shot Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11297v1)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot classification (FSC) is a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision that involves recognizing novel classes from limited data. While previous methods have focused on enhancing visual features or incorporating additional modalities, Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) offer a promising alternative due to their rich knowledge and strong visual perception. However, LVLMs risk learning specific response formats rather than effectively extracting useful information from support data in FSC tasks. In this paper, we investigate LVLMs' performance in FSC and identify key issues such as insufficient learning and the presence of severe positional biases. To tackle the above challenges, we adopt the meta-learning strategy to teach models "learn to learn". By constructing a rich set of meta-tasks for instruction fine-tuning, LVLMs enhance the ability to extract information from few-shot support data for classification. Additionally, we further boost LVLM's few-shot learning capabilities through label augmentation and candidate selection in the fine-tuning and inference stage, respectively. Label augmentation is implemented via a character perturbation strategy to ensure the model focuses on support information. Candidate selection leverages attribute descriptions to filter out unreliable candidates and simplify the task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on both general and fine-grained datasets. Furthermore, our candidate selection strategy has been proven beneficial for training-free LVLMs.</p></details> |  |

This paper delves into the underexplored security vulnerabilities of MedMLLMs, especially when deployed in clinical environments where the accuracy and relevance of question-and-answer interactions are critically tested against complex medical challenges. By combining existing clinical medical data with atypical natural phenomena, we define the mismatched malicious attack (2M-attack) and introduce its optimized version, known as the optimized mismatched malicious attack (O2M-attack or 2M-optimization). Using the voluminous 3MAD dataset that we construct, which covers a wide range of medical image modalities and harmful medical scenarios, we conduct a comprehensive analysis and propose the MCM optimization method, which significantly enhances the attack success rate on MedMLLMs. Evaluations with this dataset and attack methods, including white-box attacks on LLaVA-Med and transfer attacks (black-box) on four other SOTA models, indicate that even MedMLLMs designed with enhanced security features remain vulnerable to security breaches. Our work underscores the urgent need for a concerted effort to implement robust security measures and enhance the safety and efficacy of open-source MedMLLMs, particularly given the potential severity of jailbreak attacks and other malicious or clinically significant exploits in medical settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/dirtycomputer/O2M_attack.</p></details> |  |

However, the effectiveness of these models in clinical settings remains unclear. This scoping review aimed to assess the current generative applications of LLMs in mental health care, focusing on studies where these models were tested with human participants in real-world scenarios. A systematic search across APA PsycNet, Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science identified 726 unique articles, of which 17 met the inclusion criteria. These studies encompassed applications such as clinical assistance, counseling, therapy, and emotional support. However, the evaluation methods were often non-standardized, with most studies relying on ad hoc scales that limit comparability and robustness. Privacy, safety, and fairness were also frequently underexplored. Moreover, reliance on proprietary models, such as OpenAI's GPT series, raises concerns about transparency and reproducibility. While LLMs show potential in expanding mental health care access, especially in underserved areas, the current evidence does not fully support their use as standalone interventions. More rigorous, standardized evaluations and ethical oversight are needed to ensure these tools can be safely and effectively integrated into clinical practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniMEL: A Unified Framework for Multimodal Entity Linking with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16160v2)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) is a crucial task that aims at linking ambiguous mentions within multimodal contexts to the referent entities in a multimodal knowledge base, such as Wikipedia. Existing methods focus heavily on using complex mechanisms and extensive model tuning methods to model the multimodal interaction on specific datasets. However, these methods overcomplicate the MEL task and overlook the visual semantic information, which makes them costly and hard to scale. Moreover, these methods can not solve the issues like textual ambiguity, redundancy, and noisy images, which severely degrade their performance. Fortunately, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) with robust capabilities in text understanding and reasoning, particularly Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that can process multimodal inputs, provides new insights into addressing this challenge. However, how to design a universally applicable LLMs-based MEL approach remains a pressing challenge. To this end, we propose UniMEL, a unified framework which establishes a new paradigm to process multimodal entity linking tasks using LLMs. In this framework, we employ LLMs to augment the representation of mentions and entities individually by integrating textual and visual information and refining textual information. Subsequently, we employ the embedding-based method for retrieving and re-ranking candidate entities. Then, with only ~0.26% of the model parameters fine-tuned, LLMs can make the final selection from the candidate entities. Extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our solution achieves state-of-the-art performance, and ablation studies verify the effectiveness of all modules.

However, one critical issue that persists in these models is sycophancy, which means models are unduly influenced by leading or deceptive prompts, resulting in biased outputs and hallucinations. Despite the progress in LVLMs, evaluating and mitigating sycophancy is yet much under-explored. In this work, we fill this gap by systematically analyzing sycophancy on various VL benchmarks with curated leading queries and further proposing a text contrastive decoding method for mitigation. While the specific sycophantic behavior varies significantly among models, our analysis reveals the severe deficiency of all LVLMs in resilience of sycophancy across various tasks. For improvement, we propose Leading Query Contrastive Decoding (LQCD), a model-agnostic method focusing on calibrating the LVLMs' over-reliance on leading cues by identifying and suppressing the probabilities of sycophancy tokens at the decoding stage. Extensive experiments show that LQCD effectively mitigate sycophancy, outperforming both prompt engineering methods and common methods for hallucination mitigation. We further demonstrate that LQCD does not hurt but even slightly improves LVLMs' responses to neutral queries, suggesting it being a more effective strategy for general-purpose decoding but not limited to sycophancy.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval augmentation emerges as an effective strategy, as it can accommodate a vast number of users without the costs from fine-tuning. Existing research, however, has largely focused on enhancing the retrieval stage and devoted limited exploration toward optimizing the representation of the database, a crucial aspect for tasks such as personalization. In this work, we examine the problem from a novel angle, focusing on how data can be better represented for more data-efficient retrieval in the context of LLM customization. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Persona-DB, a simple yet effective framework consisting of a hierarchical construction process to improve generalization across task contexts and collaborative refinement to effectively bridge knowledge gaps among users. In the evaluation of response prediction, Persona-DB demonstrates superior context efficiency in maintaining accuracy with a significantly reduced retrieval size, a critical advantage in scenarios with extensive histories or limited context windows. Our experiments also indicate a marked improvement of over 10% under cold-start scenarios, when users have extremely sparse data. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the increasing importance of collaborative knowledge as the retrieval capacity expands.</p></details> |  |

However, their deployment is costly both in terms of processing power and time. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of creating smaller, highly-performing specialized algorithms by way of fine-tuning. To do this, we first present a large pre-trained model with 20 unique scenarios that combine different social contexts with games of varying social dilemmas, record its answers, and use them for Q&A fine-tuning on a smaller model of the same family. Our focus is on in-context game-theoretic decision-making, the same domain within which human interaction occurs and that requires both a theory of mind (or a semblance thereof) and an understanding of social dynamics. The smaller model is therefore trained not just on the answers provided, but also on the motivations provided by the larger model, which should contain advice and guidelines to navigate both strategic dilemmas and social cues. We find that the fine-tuned smaller language model consistently bridged the gap in performance between the smaller pre-trained version of the model and its larger relative and that its improvements extended in areas and contexts beyond the ones provided in the training examples, including on out-of-sample scenarios that include completely different game structures. On average for all games, through fine-tuning, the smaller model showed a 46% improvement measured as alignment towards the behavior of the larger model, with 100% representing indistinguishable behavior. When presented with out-of-sample social contexts and games, the fine-tuned model still displays remarkable levels of alignment, reaching an improvement of 18% and 28% respectively.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

A Comprehensive Survey and the LLMSanitize Library](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00699v3)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent years, abundant new opportunities are emerging, but also new challenges, among which contamination is quickly becoming critical. Business applications and fundraising in AI have reached a scale at which a few percentage points gained on popular question-answering benchmarks could translate into dozens of millions of dollars, placing high pressure on model integrity. At the same time, it is becoming harder and harder to keep track of the data that LLMs have seen; if not impossible with closed-source models like GPT-4 and Claude-3 not divulging any information on the training set. As a result, contamination becomes a major issue: LLMs' performance may not be reliable anymore, as the high performance may be at least partly due to their previous exposure to the data. This limitation jeopardizes the entire progress in the field of NLP, yet, there remains a lack of methods on how to efficiently detect contamination.In this paper, we survey all recent work on contamination detection with LLMs, and help the community track contamination levels of LLMs by releasing an open-source Python library named LLMSanitize implementing major contamination detection algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure, 1 table</p></details> |

However, manually analyzing qualitative data requires extensive time and effort to identify relevant topics and thematic insights. This study proposes a novel approach to address this challenge by leveraging Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based Large Language Models (LLMs) for analyzing interview transcripts. The novelty of this work lies in strategizing the research inquiry as one that is augmented by an LLM that serves as a novice research assistant. This research explores the mental model of LLMs to serve as novice qualitative research assistants for researchers in the talent management space. A RAG-based LLM approach is extended to enable topic modeling of semi-structured interview data, showcasing the versatility of these models beyond their traditional use in information retrieval and search. Our findings demonstrate that the LLM-augmented RAG approach can successfully extract topics of interest, with significant coverage compared to manually generated topics from the same dataset. This establishes the viability of employing LLMs as novice qualitative research assistants. Additionally, the study recommends that researchers leveraging such models lean heavily on quality criteria used in traditional qualitative research to ensure rigor and trustworthiness of their approach. Finally, the paper presents key recommendations for industry practitioners seeking to reconcile the use of LLMs with established qualitative research paradigms, providing a roadmap for the effective integration of these powerful, albeit novice, AI tools in the analysis of qualitative datasets within talent</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to KDD '24 workshop on Talent Management and Computing (TMC 2024). 9 pages</p></details> |

We conduct a "behavorial" study of LLMs to benchmark their capability in generating causal arguments. Across a wide range of tasks, we find that LLMs can generate text corresponding to correct causal arguments with high probability, surpassing the best-performing existing methods. Algorithms based on GPT-3.5 and 4 outperform existing algorithms on a pairwise causal discovery task (97%, 13 points gain), counterfactual reasoning task (92%, 20 points gain) and event causality (86% accuracy in determining necessary and sufficient causes in vignettes). We perform robustness checks across tasks and show that the capabilities cannot be explained by dataset memorization alone, especially since LLMs generalize to novel datasets that were created after the training cutoff date. That said, LLMs exhibit unpredictable failure modes, and we discuss the kinds of errors that may be improved and what are the fundamental limits of LLM-based answers. Overall, by operating on the text metadata, LLMs bring capabilities so far understood to be restricted to humans, such as using collected knowledge to generate causal graphs or identifying background causal context from natural language. As a result, LLMs may be used by human domain experts to save effort in setting up a causal analysis, one of the biggest impediments to the widespread adoption of causal methods. Given that LLMs ignore the actual data, our results also point to a fruitful research direction of developing algorithms that combine LLMs with existing causal techniques.

Despite the significant human and financial costs of bringing a drug to market, less than 20% of drugs in testing will make it from the first phase to final approval. Recent literature indicates that the design of the trial protocols significantly contributes to trial performance. We investigated Clinical Trial Outcome Prediction (CTOP) using trial design documents to predict phase transitions automatically. We propose CTP-LLM, the first Large Language Model (LLM) based model for CTOP. We also introduce the PhaseTransition (PT) Dataset; which labels trials based on their progression through the regulatory process and serves as a benchmark for CTOP evaluation. Our fine-tuned GPT-3.5-based model (CTP-LLM) predicts clinical trial phase transition by analyzing the trial's original protocol texts without requiring human-selected features. CTP-LLM achieves a 67% accuracy rate in predicting trial phase transitions across all phases and a 75% accuracy rate specifically in predicting the transition from Phase~III to final approval. Our experimental performance highlights the potential of LLM-powered applications in forecasting clinical trial outcomes and assessing trial design.</p></details> |  |

Most existing studies have focused on converting user behavior logs into textual prompts and leveraging techniques such as prompt tuning to enable LLMs for recommendation tasks. Meanwhile, research interest has recently grown in multimodal recommendation systems that integrate data from images, text, and other sources using modality fusion techniques. This introduces new challenges to the existing LLM-based recommendation paradigm which relies solely on text modality information. Moreover, although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) capable of processing multi-modal inputs have emerged, how to equip MLLMs with multi-modal recommendation capabilities remains largely unexplored. To this end, in this paper, we propose the Multimodal Large Language Model-enhanced Multimodaln Sequential Recommendation (MLLM-MSR) model. To capture the dynamic user preference, we design a two-stage user preference summarization method. Specifically, we first utilize an MLLM-based item-summarizer to extract image feature given an item and convert the image into text. Then, we employ a recurrent user preference summarization generation paradigm to capture the dynamic changes in user preferences based on an LLM-based user-summarizer. Finally, to enable the MLLM for multi-modal recommendation task, we propose to fine-tune a MLLM-based recommender using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) techniques. Extensive evaluations across various datasets validate the effectiveness of MLLM-MSR, showcasing its superior ability to capture and adapt to the evolving dynamics of user preferences.</p></details> |  |

Recognizing LLMs' capability to generate educational content can lead to advances in automated and personalized learning. While LLMs have been tested for their comprehension and problem-solving skills, their capability in teaching remains largely unexplored. In teaching, questioning is a key skill that guides students to analyze, evaluate, and synthesize core concepts and principles. Therefore, our research introduces a benchmark to evaluate the questioning capability in education as a teacher of LLMs through evaluating their generated educational questions, utilizing Anderson and Krathwohl's taxonomy across general, monodisciplinary, and interdisciplinary domains. We shift the focus from LLMs as learners to LLMs as educators, assessing their teaching capability through guiding them to generate questions. We apply four metrics, including relevance, coverage, representativeness, and consistency, to evaluate the educational quality of LLMs' outputs. Our results indicate that GPT-4 demonstrates significant potential in teaching general, humanities, and science courses; Claude2 appears more apt as an interdisciplinary teacher. Furthermore, the automatic scores align with human perspectives.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL 2024 |

System message, a fundamental component of LLMs, is consist of carefully crafted instructions that guide the behavior of model to meet intended goals. Despite the recognized potential of system messages to optimize AI-driven solutions, there is a notable absence of a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how well different LLMs follow these system messages. To fill this gap, we introduce SysBench, a benchmark that systematically analyzes system message following ability in terms of three challenging aspects: constraint complexity, instruction misalignment and multi-turn stability. In order to enable effective evaluation, SysBench constructs multi-turn user conversations covering various interaction relationships, based on six common types of constraints from system messages in real-world scenarios. Our dataset contains 500 system messages from various domains, each paired with 5 turns of user conversations, which have been manually formulated and checked to guarantee high quality. SysBench provides extensive evaluation across various LLMs, measuring their ability to follow specified constraints given in system messages. The results highlight both the strengths and weaknesses of existing models, offering key insights and directions for future research. The open source library SysBench is available at https://github.com/PKU-Baichuan-MLSystemLab/SysBench.</p></details> |  |

Existing large 3D Gaussian models directly map 2D image to 3D Gaussian parameters, while regressing 2D image to 3D Gaussian representations is challenging without 3D priors. In this paper, we propose a large Point-to-Gaussian model, that inputs the initial point cloud produced from large 3D diffusion model conditional on 2D image to generate the Gaussian parameters, for image-to-3D generation.

This calls for the 3D understanding directly in this representation space. To facilitate the research in this direction, we first build a large-scale dataset of 3DGS using the commonly used ShapeNet and ModelNet datasets. Our dataset ShapeSplat consists of 65K objects from 87 unique categories, whose labels are in accordance with the respective datasets. The creation of this dataset utilized the compute equivalent of 2 GPU years on a TITAN XP GPU. We utilize our dataset for unsupervised pretraining and supervised finetuning for classification and segmentation tasks. To this end, we introduce \textbf{\textit{Gaussian-MAE}}, which highlights the unique benefits of representation learning from Gaussian parameters. Through exhaustive experiments, we provide several valuable insights. In particular, we show that (1) the distribution of the optimized GS centroids significantly differs from the uniformly sampled point cloud (used for initialization) counterpart; (2) this change in distribution results in degradation in classification but improvement in segmentation tasks when using only the centroids; (3) to leverage additional Gaussian parameters, we propose Gaussian feature grouping in a normalized feature space, along with splats pooling layer, offering a tailored solution to effectively group and embed similar Gaussians, which leads to notable improvement in finetuning tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we address this concern for tabular data. Specifically, we introduce a variety of different techniques to assess whether a language model has seen a tabular dataset during training. This investigation reveals that LLMs have memorized many popular tabular datasets verbatim. We then compare the few-shot learning performance of LLMs on datasets that were seen during training to the performance on datasets released after training. We find that LLMs perform better on datasets seen during training, indicating that memorization leads to overfitting. At the same time, LLMs show non-trivial performance on novel datasets and are surprisingly robust to data transformations. We then investigate the in-context statistical learning abilities of LLMs. While LLMs are significantly better than random at solving statistical classification problems, the sample efficiency of few-shot learning lags behind traditional statistical learning algorithms, especially as the dimension of the problem increases. This suggests that much of the observed few-shot performance on novel real-world datasets is due to the LLM's world knowledge. Overall, our results highlight the importance of testing whether an LLM has seen an evaluation dataset during pre-training. We release the https://github.com/interpretml/LLM-Tabular-Memorization-Checker Python package to test LLMs for memorization of tabular datasets.</p></details> | COLM camera ready |
| **[Distillation Matters: Empowering Sequential Recommenders to Match the Performance of Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00338v3)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Owing to their powerful semantic reasoning capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been effectively utilized as recommenders, achieving impressive performance. However, the high inference latency of LLMs significantly restricts their practical deployment. To address this issue, this work investigates knowledge distillation from cumbersome LLM-based recommendation models to lightweight conventional sequential models. It encounters three challenges: 1) the teacher's knowledge may not always be reliable; 2) the capacity gap between the teacher and student makes it difficult for the student to assimilate the teacher's knowledge; 3) divergence in semantic space poses a challenge to distill the knowledge from embeddings. To tackle these challenges, this work proposes a novel distillation strategy, DLLM2Rec, specifically tailored for knowledge distillation from LLM-based recommendation models to conventional sequential models. DLLM2Rec comprises: 1) Importance-aware ranking distillation, which filters reliable and student-friendly knowledge by weighting instances according to teacher confidence and student-teacher consistency; 2) Collaborative embedding distillation integrates knowledge from teacher embeddings with collaborative signals mined from the data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DLLM2Rec, boosting three typical sequential models with an average improvement of 47.97%, even enabling them to surpass LLM-based recommenders in some cases.</p></details> | 11 pages, 2 figures |

Crucially, this scheme offers users potential privacy and security benefits by only ever communicating updates to the model weights to a central server as opposed to traditional machine learning (ML) training which directly communicates and aggregates data. However, FL training suffers from statistical heterogeneity as clients may have differing local data distributions. Large language models (LLMs) offer a potential solution to this issue of heterogeneity given that they have consistently been shown to be able to learn on vast amounts of noisy data. While LLMs are a promising development for resolving the consistent issue of non-I.I.D. Clients in federated settings exacerbate two other bottlenecks in FL: limited local computing and expensive communication. This thesis aims to develop efficient training methods for LLMs in FL. To this end, we employ two critical techniques in enabling efficient training. First, we use low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to reduce the computational load of local model training. Second, we communicate sparse updates throughout training to significantly cut down on communication costs. Taken together, our method reduces communication costs by up to 10x over vanilla LoRA and up to 5x over more complex sparse LoRA baselines while achieving greater utility. We emphasize the importance of carefully applying sparsity and picking effective rank and sparsity configurations for federated LLM training.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This submission has been withdrawn by arXiv administrators due to inappropriate text overlap with external sources</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking Large Language Models for Math Reasoning Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10839v1)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in mathematical reasoning has become a cornerstone of related research, demonstrating the intelligence of these models and enabling potential practical applications through their advanced performance, such as in educational settings. Despite the variety of datasets and in-context learning algorithms designed to improve the ability of LLMs to automate mathematical problem solving, the lack of comprehensive benchmarking across different datasets makes it complicated to select an appropriate model for specific tasks. In this project, we present a benchmark that fairly compares seven state-of-the-art in-context learning algorithms for mathematical problem solving across five widely used mathematical datasets on four powerful foundation models. Furthermore, we explore the trade-off between efficiency and performance, highlighting the practical applications of LLMs for mathematical reasoning. Our results indicate that larger foundation models like GPT-4o and LLaMA 3-70B can solve mathematical reasoning independently from the concrete prompting strategy, while for smaller models the in-context learning approach significantly influences the performance. Moreover, the optimal prompt depends on the chosen foundation model. We open-source our benchmark code to support the integration of additional models in future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploiting Large Language Models Capabilities for Question Answer-Driven Knowledge Graph Completion Across Static and Temporal Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10819v1)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to identify missing triples in a knowledge graph (KG). This is typically achieved through tasks such as link prediction and instance completion. However, these methods often focus on either static knowledge graphs (SKGs) or temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs), addressing only within-scope triples. This paper introduces a new generative completion framework called Generative Subgraph-based KGC (GS-KGC). GS-KGC employs a question-answering format to directly generate target entities, addressing the challenge of questions having multiple possible answers. We propose a strategy that extracts subgraphs centered on entities and relationships within the KG, from which negative samples and neighborhood information are separately obtained to address the one-to-many problem. Our method generates negative samples using known facts to facilitate the discovery of new information. Furthermore, we collect and refine neighborhood path data of known entities, providing contextual information to enhance reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Our experiments evaluated the proposed method on four SKGs and two TKGs, achieving state-of-the-art Hits@1 metrics on five datasets. Analysis of the results shows that GS-KGC can discover new triples within existing KGs and generate new facts beyond the closed KG, effectively bridging the gap between closed-world and open-world KGC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Carbon Footprint Accounting Driven by Large Language Models and Retrieval-augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09713v2)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Carbon footprint accounting is crucial for quantifying greenhouse gas emissions and achieving carbon neutrality.The dynamic nature of processes, accounting rules, carbon-related policies, and energy supply structures necessitates real-time updates of CFA. Traditional life cycle assessment methods rely heavily on human expertise, making near-real-time updates challenging. This paper introduces a novel approach integrating large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation technology to enhance the real-time, professional, and economical aspects of carbon footprint information retrieval and analysis. By leveraging LLMs' logical and language understanding abilities and RAG's efficient retrieval capabilities, the proposed method LLMs-RAG-CFA can retrieve more relevant professional information to assist LLMs, enhancing the model's generative abilities. This method offers broad professional coverage, efficient real-time carbon footprint information acquisition and accounting, and cost-effective automation without frequent LLMs' parameter updates. Experimental results across five industries(primary aluminum, lithium battery, photovoltaic, new energy vehicles, and transformers)demonstrate that the LLMs-RAG-CFA method outperforms traditional methods and other LLMs, achieving higher information retrieval rates and significantly lower information deviations and carbon footprint accounting deviations. The economically viable design utilizes RAG technology to balance real-time updates with cost-effectiveness, providing an efficient, reliable, and cost-saving solution for real-time carbon emission management, thereby enhancing environmental sustainability practices.</p></details> |  |

However, this solution introduces substantial time and space overhead due to the separate models required. This work proposes Non-disruptive parameters insertion (Otter), inserting extra parameters into the transformer architecture to predict calibration signals along with the original LLM output. Otter offers state-of-the-art performance on multiple demanding tasks while saving up to 86.5\% extra space and 98.5\% extra time. Furthermore, Otter seamlessly integrates with existing inference engines, requiring only a one-line code change, and the original model response remains accessible after the parameter insertion.

In recent years, with the development of Vision Transformer (ViT) and self-supervised learning techniques, the performance of person ReID based on self-supervised pre-training has been greatly improved. Person ReID requires extracting highly discriminative local fine-grained features of the human body, while traditional ViT is good at extracting context-related global features, making it difficult to focus on local human body features. To this end, this article introduces the recently emerged Masked Image Modeling (MIM) self-supervised learning method into person ReID, and effectively extracts high-quality global and local features through large-scale unsupervised pre-training by combining masked image modeling and discriminative contrastive learning, and then conducts supervised fine-tuning training in the person ReID task. This person feature extraction method based on ViT with masked image modeling (PersonViT) has the good characteristics of unsupervised, scalable, and strong generalization capabilities, overcoming the problem of difficult annotation in supervised person ReID, and achieves state-of-the-art results on publicly available benchmark datasets, including MSMT17, Market1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and Occluded-Duke. The code and pre-trained models of the PersonViT method are released at \url{https://github.com/hustvl/PersonViT} to promote further research in the person ReID field.</p></details> |  |

At the same time, understanding if they are able to do so because they capture code semantics, and how well, is still an open question. In this paper, we tackle this problem by introducing SeqCoBench, a benchmark for systematically assessing how Code-LLMs can capture code functional equivalence. SeqCoBench contains over 20 code transformations that either preserve or alter the semantics of Python programs. We conduct extensive evaluations in different settings, including zero-shot and parameter-efficient finetuning methods on state-of-the-art (Code-)LLMs to see if they can discern semantically equivalent or different pairs of programs in SeqCoBench. We find that the performance gap between these LLMs and classical match-based retrieval scores is minimal, with both approaches showing a concerning lack of depth in understanding code semantics.</p></details> | 37 pages |

Despite the advancements in human face identification, the lack of datasets and benchmarks in the animal domain has impeded progress. In this paper, we introduce the PetFace dataset, a comprehensive resource for animal face identification encompassing 257,484 unique individuals across 13 animal families and 319 breed categories, including both experimental and pet animals. This large-scale collection of individuals facilitates the investigation of unseen animal face verification, an area that has not been sufficiently explored in existing datasets due to the limited number of individuals. Moreover, PetFace also has fine-grained annotations such as sex, breed, color, and pattern. We provide multiple benchmarks including re-identification for seen individuals and verification for unseen individuals. The models trained on our dataset outperform those trained on prior datasets, even for detailed breed variations and unseen animal families. Our result also indicates that there is some room to improve the performance of integrated identification on multiple animal families. We hope the PetFace dataset will facilitate animal face identification and encourage the development of non-invasive animal automatic identification methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024.

However, the characteristics introduced by mid-band XL-MIMO systems pose challenges for channel modeling and performance analysis. In this paper, we first analyze the potential characteristics of mid-band MIMO channels. Then, an analytical channel model incorporating novel channel characteristics is proposed, based on a review of classical analytical channel models. This model is convenient for theoretical analysis and compatible with other analytical channel models. Subsequently, based on the proposed channel model, we analyze key metrics of wireless communication, including the ergodic spectral efficiency (SE) and outage probability (OP) of MIMO maximal-ratio combining systems. Specifically, we derive closed-form approximations and performance bounds for two typical scenarios, aiming to illustrate the influence of mid-band XL-MIMO systems. Finally, comparisons between systems under different practical configurations are carried out through simulations. The theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate that mid-band XL-MIMO systems excel in SE and OP due to the increased array elements, moderate large-scale fading, and enlarged transmission bandwidth.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

This paper introduces a novel Large Language Model Evolutionary Algorithm (LLaMEA) framework, leveraging GPT models for the automated generation and refinement of algorithms. Given a set of criteria and a task definition (the search space), LLaMEA iteratively generates, mutates and selects algorithms based on performance metrics and feedback from runtime evaluations. This framework offers a unique approach to generating optimized algorithms without requiring extensive prior expertise. We show how this framework can be used to generate novel black-box metaheuristic optimization algorithms automatically. LLaMEA generates multiple algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art optimization algorithms (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy and Differential Evolution) on the five dimensional black box optimization benchmark (BBOB). The algorithms also show competitive performance on the 10- and 20-dimensional instances of the test functions, although they have not seen such instances during the automated generation process. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the framework and identify future directions for automated generation and optimization of algorithms via LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE TEVC</p></details> |

The increasing amount of scientific literature allows these models to acquire and understand scientific knowledge effectively, thus improving their performance in a wide range of tasks. Due to the power of LLMs, they require extremely expensive computational resources, intense amounts of data, and training time. Therefore, in recent years, researchers have proposed various methodologies to make scientific LLMs more affordable. The most well-known approaches align in two directions. It can be either focusing on the size of the models or enhancing the quality of data. To date, a comprehensive review of these two families of methods has not yet been undertaken. In this paper, we (I) summarize the current advances in the emerging abilities of LLMs into more accessible AI solutions for science, and (II) investigate the challenges and opportunities of developing affordable solutions for scientific domains using LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Their powerful generative abilities enable flexible responses based on various queries or instructions. Emerging as widely adopted generalists for diverse tasks, LLMs are still vulnerable to backdoors. This paper proposes an editing-based generative backdoor, named MEGen, aiming to create a customized backdoor for NLP tasks with the least side effects. In our approach, we first leverage a language model to insert a trigger selected on fixed metrics into the input, then design a pipeline of model editing to directly embed a backdoor into an LLM. By adjusting a small set of local parameters with a mini-batch of samples, MEGen significantly enhances time efficiency and achieves high robustness. Experimental results indicate that our backdoor attack strategy achieves a high attack success rate on poison data while maintaining the model's performance on clean data. Notably, the backdoored model, when triggered, can freely output pre-set dangerous information while successfully completing downstream tasks. This suggests that future LLM applications could be guided to deliver certain dangerous information, thus altering the LLM's generative style. We believe this approach provides insights for future LLM applications and the execution of backdoor attacks on conversational AI systems.</p></details> | Working in progress |

However, these benchmarks may not fully capture a model's code understanding abilities. We introduce CodeJudge-Eval (CJ-Eval), a novel benchmark designed to assess LLMs' code understanding abilities from the perspective of code judging rather than code generation. CJ-Eval challenges models to determine the correctness of provided code solutions, encompassing various error types and compilation issues. By leveraging a diverse set of problems and a fine-grained judging system, CJ-Eval addresses the limitations of traditional benchmarks, including the potential memorization of solutions. Evaluation of 12 well-known LLMs on CJ-Eval reveals that even state-of-the-art models struggle, highlighting the benchmark's ability to probe deeper into models' code understanding abilities.

This study investigates local fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), specifically LLaMA models, for physician letter generation in a privacy-preserving manner within the field of radiation oncology. Our findings demonstrate that base LLaMA models, without fine-tuning, are inadequate for effectively generating physician letters. The QLoRA algorithm provides an efficient method for local intra-institutional fine-tuning of LLMs with limited computational resources (i.e., a single 48 GB GPU workstation within the hospital). The fine-tuned LLM successfully learns radiation oncology-specific information and generates physician letters in an institution-specific style. ROUGE scores of the generated summary reports highlight the superiority of the 8B LLaMA-3 model over the 13B LLaMA-2 model. Further multidimensional physician evaluations of 10 cases reveal that, although the fine-tuned LLaMA-3 model has limited capacity to generate content beyond the provided input data, it successfully generates salutations, diagnoses and treatment histories, recommendations for further treatment, and planned schedules. Overall, clinical benefit was rated highly by the clinical experts (average score of 3.44 on a 4-point scale). With careful physician review and correction, automated LLM-based physician letter generation has significant practical value.</p></details> |  |

Therefore researchers, policy makers and enterprises alike are working towards ensuring that the decisions made by these agents align with human values and user expectations. That being said, human values and decisions are not always straightforward to measure and are subject to different cognitive biases. There is a vast section of literature in Behavioural Science which studies biases in human judgements. In this work we report an ongoing investigation on alignment of LLMs with human judgements affected by order bias. Specifically, we focus on a famous human study which showed evidence of order effects in similarity judgements, and replicate it with various popular LLMs. We report the different settings where LLMs exhibit human-like order effect bias and discuss the implications of these findings to inform the design and development of LLM based applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at The First Workshop on AI Behavioral Science (AIBS 2024), held in conjunction with KDD 2024</p></details> |

Generative models (GMs) cannot retain the necessary information enough from the source modality to the target one, while non-GMs struggle to align features across these two modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine MDIR framework,LLM-Morph, which is applicable to various pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve these concerns by aligning the deep features from different modal medical images. Specifically, we first utilize a CNN encoder to extract deep visual features from cross-modal image pairs, then we use the first adapter to adjust these tokens, and use LoRA in pre-trained LLMs to fine-tune their weights, both aimed at eliminating the domain gap between the pre-trained LLMs and the MDIR task. Third, for the alignment of tokens, we utilize other four adapters to transform the LLM-encoded tokens into multi-scale visual features, generating multi-scale deformation fields and facilitating the coarse-to-fine MDIR task. Extensive experiments in MR-CT Abdomen and SR-Reg Brain datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and the potential of pre-trained LLMs for MDIR task.

In this work, we address one of the challenges of UQ in generation tasks that arises from the conditional dependency between the generation steps of an LLM. We propose to learn this dependency from data. We train a regression model, which target variable is the gap between the conditional and the unconditional generation confidence. During LLM inference, we use this learned conditional dependency model to modulate the uncertainty of the current generation step based on the uncertainty of the previous step. Our experimental evaluation on nine datasets and three LLMs shows that the proposed method is highly effective for uncertainty quantification, achieving substantial improvements over rivaling approaches.</p></details> |  |

The LLMs exhibit impressive zero-shot ability, however, require fine-tuning on local datasets and significant resources for deployment. Traditional fine-tuning techniques with the first-order optimizers require substantial GPU memory that exceeds mainstream hardware capability. Therefore, memory-efficient methods are motivated to be investigated. Model compression techniques can reduce energy consumption, operational costs, and environmental impact so that to support sustainable artificial intelligence advancements. Additionally, large-scale foundation models have expanded to create images, audio, videos, and multi-modal contents, further emphasizing the need for efficient deployment. Therefore, we are motivated to present a comprehensive overview of the prevalent memory-efficient fine-tuning methods over the network edge. We also review the state-of-the-art literatures on model compression to provide a vision on deploying LLMs over the network edge.</p></details> |  |

Previous work has largely focused on locating entity-related (often single-token) facts in smaller models. However, several key questions remain unanswered: (1) How can we effectively locate query-relevant neurons in contemporary autoregressive LLMs, such as Llama and Mistral? (2) How can we address the challenge of long-form text generation? (3) Are there localized knowledge regions in LLMs? In this study, we introduce Query-Relevant Neuron Cluster Attribution (QRNCA), a novel architecture-agnostic framework capable of identifying query-relevant neurons in LLMs. QRNCA allows for the examination of long-form answers beyond triplet facts by employing the proxy task of multi-choice question answering. To evaluate the effectiveness of our detected neurons, we build two multi-choice QA datasets spanning diverse domains and languages. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline methods significantly. Further, analysis of neuron distributions reveals the presence of visible localized regions, particularly within different domains. Finally, we show potential applications of our detected neurons in knowledge editing and neuron-based prediction.</p></details> | 14 pages |

For example, if a LVLM was released on January 2024, and it wouldn't know the singer of the theme song for the new Detective Conan movie, which wasn't released until April 2024. To solve the problem, a promising solution motivated by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is to provide LVLMs with up-to-date knowledge via internet search during inference, i.e., internet-augmented generation (IAG), which is already integrated in some closed-source commercial LVLMs such as GPT-4V. However, the specific mechanics underpinning them remain a mystery. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play framework, for augmenting existing LVLMs in handling visual question answering (VQA) about up-to-date knowledge, dubbed SearchLVLMs. A hierarchical filtering model is trained to effectively and efficiently find the most helpful content from the websites returned by a search engine to prompt LVLMs with up-to-date knowledge. To train the model and evaluate our framework's performance, we propose a pipeline to automatically generate news-related VQA samples to construct a dataset, dubbed UDK-VQA. A multi-model voting mechanism is introduced to label the usefulness of website/content for VQA samples to construct the training set.

However, the function of descriptive instructions during ICL remains under-explored. In this work, we propose an ensemble prompt framework to describe the selection criteria of multiple in-context examples, and preliminary experiments on machine translation (MT) across six translation directions confirm that this framework boosts ICL perfromance. But to our surprise, LLMs might not necessarily care what the descriptions actually say, and the performance gain is primarily caused by the ensemble format, since the framework could lead to improvement even with random descriptive nouns. We further apply this new ensemble prompt on a range of commonsense, math, logical reasoning and hallucination tasks with three LLMs and achieve promising results, suggesting again that designing a proper prompt format would be much more effective and efficient than paying effort into specific descriptions.

In previous studies, the predicted manipulation regions of the target object typically do not change with specification from the language instructions, which means that the language perception and manipulation prediction are separate. However, in human behavioral patterns, the manipulation regions of the same object will change for different language instructions. In this paper, we propose Instruction-Guided Affordance Net (IGANet) for predicting affordance maps of instruction-guided robotic manipulation tasks by utilizing powerful priors from vision and language encoders pre-trained on large-scale datasets. We develop a Vison-Language-Models(VLMs)-based data augmentation pipeline, which can generate a large amount of data automatically for model training. Besides, with the help of Large-Language-Models(LLMs), actions can be effectively executed to finish the tasks defined by instructions.

Existing methods achieve this by concatenating collaborative features with text tokens into a unified sequence input and then fine-tuning to align these features with LLM's input space. Although effective, in this work, we identify two limitations when adapting LLMs to recommendation tasks, which hinder the integration of general knowledge and collaborative information, resulting in sub-optimal recommendation performance. (1) Fine-tuning LLM with recommendation data can undermine its inherent world knowledge and fundamental competencies, which are crucial for interpreting and inferring recommendation text. (2) Incorporating collaborative features into textual prompts disrupts the semantics of the original prompts, preventing LLM from generating appropriate outputs. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm, CoRA (an acronym for Collaborative LoRA), with a collaborative weights generator. Rather than input space alignment, this method aligns collaborative information with LLM's parameter space, representing them as incremental weights to update LLM's output. This way, LLM perceives collaborative information without altering its general knowledge and text inference capabilities. Specifically, we employ a collaborative filtering model to extract user and item embeddings, converting them into collaborative weights with low-rank properties through the collaborative weights generator. We then merge the collaborative weights into LLM's weights, enabling LLM to perceive the collaborative signals and generate personalized recommendations without fine-tuning or extra collaborative tokens in prompts. Extensive experiments confirm that CoRA effectively integrates collaborative information into LLM, enhancing recommendation performance.</p></details> |  |

Existing post-training pruning techniques primarily focus on measuring weight importance on converged dense models to determine salient weights to retain. However, they often overlook the changes in weight importance during the pruning process, which can lead to performance degradation in the pruned models. To address this issue, we present LLM-Barber (Block-Aware Rebuilder for Sparsity Mask in One-Shot), a novel one-shot pruning framework that rebuilds the sparsity mask of pruned models without any retraining or weight reconstruction. LLM-Barber incorporates block-aware error optimization across Self-Attention and MLP blocks, ensuring global performance optimization. Inspired by the recent discovery of prominent outliers in LLMs, LLM-Barber introduces an innovative pruning metric that identifies weight importance using weights multiplied by gradients. Our experiments show that LLM-Barber can efficiently prune models like LLaMA and OPT families with 7B to 13B parameters on a single A100 GPU in just 30 minutes, achieving state-of-the-art results in both perplexity and zero-shot performance across various language benchmarks.

| **[Enhancing Robustness in Large Language Models: Prompting for Mitigating the Impact of Irrelevant Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10615v1)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention due to their superior performance in complex reasoning tasks. However, recent studies may diminish their reasoning capabilities markedly when problem descriptions contain irrelevant information, even with the use of advanced prompting techniques. To further investigate this issue, a dataset of primary school mathematics problems containing irrelevant information, named GSMIR, was constructed. Testing prominent LLMs and prompting techniques on this dataset revealed that while LLMs can identify irrelevant information, they do not effectively mitigate the interference it causes once identified. A novel automatic construction method, ATF, which enhances the ability of LLMs to identify and self-mitigate the influence of irrelevant information, is proposed to address this shortcoming. This method operates in two steps: first, analysis of irrelevant information, followed by its filtering. The ATF method, as demonstrated by experimental results, significantly improves the reasoning performance of LLMs and prompting techniques, even in the presence of irrelevant information on the GSMIR dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Task-level Distributionally Robust Optimization for Large Language Model-based Dense Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10613v1)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model-based Dense Retrieval (LLM-DR) optimizes over numerous heterogeneous fine-tuning collections from different domains. However, the discussion about its training data distribution is still minimal. Previous studies rely on empirically assigned dataset choices or sampling ratios, which inevitably leads to sub-optimal retrieval performances. In this paper, we propose a new task-level Distributionally Robust Optimization (tDRO) algorithm for LLM-DR fine-tuning, targeted at improving the universal domain generalization ability by end-to-end reweighting the data distribution of each task. The tDRO parameterizes the domain weights and updates them with scaled domain gradients. The optimized weights are then transferred to the LLM-DR fine-tuning to train more robust retrievers. Experiments show optimal improvements in large-scale retrieval benchmarks and reduce up to 30% dataset usage after applying our optimization algorithm with a series of different-sized LLM-DR models.</p></details> |  |

Although techniques such as Affective Alignment can mitigate some negative impacts of these biases, existing prompt-based attack methods can still extract these biases from the model's weights. Moreover, these biases frequently appear subtly when LLMs are prompted to perform identical tasks across different demographic groups, thereby camouflaging their presence. To address this issue, we have formally defined the implicit bias problem and developed an innovative framework for bias removal based on Bayesian theory, Bayesian-Theory based Bias Removal (BTBR). BTBR employs likelihood ratio screening to pinpoint data entries within publicly accessible biased datasets that represent biases inadvertently incorporated during the LLM training phase. It then automatically constructs relevant knowledge triples and expunges bias information from LLMs using model editing techniques. Through extensive experimentation, we have confirmed the presence of the implicit bias problem in LLMs and demonstrated the effectiveness of our BTBR approach.</p></details> |  |

By instructing LLMs using few-shot demonstrative examples, ICL enables them to perform a wide range of tasks without needing to update millions of parameters. This paper presents a unified framework for LLMs that allows them to self-select influential in-context examples to compose their contexts; self-rank candidates with different demonstration compositions; self-optimize the demonstration selection and ordering through reinforcement learning. Specifically, our method designs a parameter-efficient retrieval head that generates the optimized demonstration after training with rewards from LLM's own preference. Experimental results validate the proposed method's effectiveness in enhancing ICL performance. Additionally, our approach effectively identifies and selects the most representative examples for the current task, and includes more diversity in retrieval.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

Large pre-trained models have shown capabilities to interpret tasks defined via language descriptions. However, previous methods attempting to integrate large pre-trained models with daily tasks are not competent in many robotic goal navigation tasks due to poor understanding of the environment. In this work, we present a visual scene representation built with large-scale visual language models to form a feature representation of the environment capable of handling natural language queries. Combined with large language models, this method can parse language instructions into action sequences for a robot to follow, and accomplish goal navigation with querying the scene representation. Experiments demonstrate that our method enables the robot to follow a wide range of instructions and complete complex goal navigation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Large Language Model Hyperparameters for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10577v1)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT models, are increasingly used in software engineering for various tasks, such as code generation, requirements management, and debugging. While automating these tasks has garnered significant attention, a systematic study on the impact of varying hyperparameters on code generation outcomes remains unexplored. This study aims to assess LLMs' code generation performance by exhaustively exploring the impact of various hyperparameters. Hyperparameters for LLMs are adjustable settings that affect the model's behaviour and performance. Specifically, we investigated how changes to the hyperparameters: temperature, top probability (top_p), frequency penalty, and presence penalty affect code generation outcomes. We systematically adjusted all hyperparameters together, exploring every possible combination by making small increments to each hyperparameter at a time. This exhaustive approach was applied to 13 Python code generation tasks, yielding one of four outcomes for each hyperparameter combination: no output from the LLM, non executable code, code that fails unit tests, or correct and functional code. We analysed these outcomes for a total of 14,742 generated Python code segments, focusing on correctness, to determine how the hyperparameters influence the LLM to arrive at each outcome. Using correlation coefficient and regression tree analyses, we ascertained which hyperparameters influence which aspect of the LLM. Our results indicate that optimal performance is achieved with a temperature below 0.5, top probability below 0.75, frequency penalty above -1 and below 1.5, and presence penalty above -1. We make our dataset and results available to facilitate replication.</p></details> |  |
| **[MegaAgent: A Practical Framework for Autonomous Cooperation in Large-Scale LLM Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09955v2)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), LLM-powered multi-agent systems (LLM-MA systems) have been proposed to tackle real-world tasks. However, their agents mostly follow predefined Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that remain unchanged across the whole interaction, lacking autonomy and scalability. Additionally, current solutions often overlook the necessity for effective agent cooperation. To address the above limitations, we propose MegaAgent, a practical framework designed for autonomous cooperation in large-scale LLM Agent systems. MegaAgent leverages the autonomy of agents to dynamically generate agents based on task requirements, incorporating features such as automatically dividing tasks, systematic planning and monitoring of agent activities, and managing concurrent operations. In addition, MegaAgent is designed with a hierarchical structure and employs system-level parallelism to enhance performance and boost communication. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MegaAgent through Gobang game development, showing that it outperforms popular LLM-MA systems; and national policy simulation, demonstrating its high autonomy and potential to rapidly scale up to 590 agents while ensuring effective cooperation among them. Our results indicate that MegaAgent is the first autonomous large-scale LLM-MA system with no pre-defined SOPs, high effectiveness and scalability, paving the way for further research in this field.

However, substantial computational requirements make their deployment challenging on devices with limited resources. Recently, compression methods using low-rank matrix techniques have shown promise, yet these often lead to degraded accuracy or introduce significant overhead in parameters and inference latency. This paper introduces \textbf{Mo}dular \textbf{De}composition (MoDeGPT), a novel structured compression framework that does not need recovery fine-tuning while resolving the above drawbacks. MoDeGPT partitions the Transformer block into modules comprised of matrix pairs and reduces the hidden dimensions via reconstructing the module-level outputs. MoDeGPT is developed based on a theoretical framework that utilizes three well-established matrix decomposition algorithms -- Nystr\"om approximation, CR decomposition, and SVD -- and applies them to our redefined transformer modules. Our comprehensive experiments show MoDeGPT, without backward propagation, matches or surpasses previous structured compression methods that rely on gradient information, and saves 98% of compute costs on compressing a 13B model. On \textsc{Llama}-2/3 and OPT models, MoDeGPT maintains 90-95% zero-shot performance with 25-30% compression rates. Moreover, the compression can be done on a single GPU within a few hours and increases the inference throughput by up to 46%.</p></details> | 31 pages, 9 figures |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in bridging this gap. However, previous attempts to directly implement LLMs as recommenders fall short in meeting the requirements of industrial RSs, particularly in terms of online inference latency and offline resource efficiency. Thus, we propose REKI to acquire two types of external knowledge about users and items from LLMs. Specifically, we introduce factorization prompting to elicit accurate knowledge reasoning on user preferences and items. We develop individual knowledge extraction and collective knowledge extraction tailored for different scales of scenarios, effectively reducing offline resource consumption. Subsequently, generated knowledge undergoes efficient transformation and condensation into augmented vectors through a hybridized expert-integrated network, ensuring compatibility. The obtained vectors can then be used to enhance any conventional recommendation model. We also ensure efficient inference by preprocessing and prestoring the knowledge from LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that REKI outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and is compatible with lots of recommendation algorithms and tasks. Now, REKI has been deployed to Huawei's news and music recommendation platforms and gained a 7% and 1.99% improvement during the online A/B test.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2306.10933</p></details> |

Traditional models struggle to capture complex patterns due to these issues, compounded by limitations in computational resources and model capacity. Inspired by the success of large language models in NLP, we introduce $\textbf{PLUTUS}$, a $\textbf{P}$re-trained $\textbf{L}$arge $\textbf{U}$nified $\textbf{T}$ransformer-based model that $\textbf{U}$nveils regularities in financial time $\textbf{S}$eries. PLUTUS uses an invertible embedding module with contrastive learning and autoencoder techniques to create an approximate one-to-one mapping between raw data and patch embeddings. TimeFormer, an attention based architecture, forms the core of PLUTUS, effectively modeling high-noise time series. We incorporate a novel attention mechanisms to capture features across both variable and temporal dimensions. PLUTUS is pre-trained on an unprecedented dataset of 100 billion observations, designed to thrive in noisy financial environments. To our knowledge, PLUTUS is the first open-source, large-scale, pre-trained financial time series model with over one billion parameters. It achieves state-of-the-art performance in various tasks, demonstrating strong transferability and establishing a robust foundational model for finance. Our research provides technical guidance for pre-training financial time series data, setting a new standard in the field.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Well Do Large Language Models Serve as End-to-End Secure Code Producers?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10495v1)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 has revolutionized the landscape of software engineering, positioning these models at the core of modern development practices. As we anticipate these models to evolve into the primary and trustworthy tools used in software development, ensuring the security of the code they produce becomes paramount. How well can LLMs serve as end-to-end secure code producers? This paper presents a systematic investigation into LLMs' inherent potential to generate code with fewer vulnerabilities. Specifically, We studied GPT-3.5 and GPT-4's capability to identify and repair vulnerabilities in the code generated by four popular LLMs including themselves (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Code Llama, and CodeGeeX2). By manually or automatically reviewing 4,900 pieces of code, our study reveals that: (1) large language models lack awareness of scenario-relevant security risks, which leads to the generation of over 75% vulnerable code on the SecurityEval benchmark; (2) LLMs such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are unable to precisely identify vulnerabilities in the code they generated; (3) GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can achieve 33.2%~59.6% success rates in repairing the insecure code produced by the 4 LLMs, but they both perform poorly when repairing self-produced code, indicating self-repair "blind spots". To address the limitation of a single round of repair, we developed a lightweight tool that prompts LLMs to construct safer source code through an iterative repair procedure based on the insights gained from our study. Experiments show that assisted by semantic analysis engines, our tool significantly improves the success rates of repair to 65.9%~85.5%.</p></details> |  |

Through meticulously designed prompt engineering, we guided ChatGLM to generate a series of simulated questions and conducted a comprehensive comparison with questions recollected from past examinees. To ensure the objectivity and professionalism of the evaluation, we invited experts in the field of education to assess these questions and their scoring criteria. The research results indicate that the questions generated by ChatGLM exhibit a high level of rationality, scientificity, and practicality similar to those of the real exam questions across most evaluation criteria, demonstrating the model's accuracy and reliability in question generation. Nevertheless, the study also reveals limitations in the model's consideration of various rating criteria when generating questions, suggesting the need for further optimization and adjustment. This research not only validates the application potential of ChatGLM in the field of educational assessment but also provides crucial empirical support for the development of more efficient and intelligent educational automated generation systems in the future.</p></details> |  |

More recently, these workflows have been significantly augmented with the advent of large language models (LLMs) and systems of LLM-driven agents capable of utilizing pre-trained models to make predictions in the context of more complex research tasks. While effective, there is still room for substantial improvement within the agentic systems on the retrieval of salient information for material design tasks. Moreover, alternative uses of predictive deep learning models, such as leveraging their latent representations to facilitate cross-modal retrieval augmented generation within agentic systems to enable task-specific materials design, has remained unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate that large, pre-trained chemistry foundation models can serve as a basis for enabling semantic chemistry information retrieval for both small-molecules, complex polymeric materials, and reactions. Additionally, we show the use of chemistry foundation models in conjunction with image models such as OpenCLIP facilitate unprecedented queries and information retrieval across multiple characterization data domains. Finally, we demonstrate the integration of these systems within multi-agent systems to facilitate structure and topological-based natural language queries and information retrieval for complex research tasks.</p></details> |  |

This survey presents a comprehensive review of more than 40 research papers, demonstrating the role of foundation models in enhancing AD. Large language models contribute to planning and simulation in AD, particularly through their proficiency in reasoning, code generation and translation. In parallel, vision foundation models are increasingly adapted for critical tasks such as 3D object detection and tracking, as well as creating realistic driving scenarios for simulation and testing. Multi-modal foundation models, integrating diverse inputs, exhibit exceptional visual understanding and spatial reasoning, crucial for end-to-end AD. This survey not only provides a structured taxonomy, categorizing foundation models based on their modalities and functionalities within the AD domain but also delves into the methods employed in current research. It identifies the gaps between existing foundation models and cutting-edge AD approaches, thereby charting future research directions and proposing a roadmap for bridging these gaps.</p></details> |  |
| **[PowerPM: Foundation Model for Power Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04057v2)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of abundant electricity time series (ETS) data provides ample opportunities for various applications in the power systems, including demand-side management, grid stability, and consumer behavior analysis. Deep learning models have advanced ETS modeling by effectively capturing sequence dependence. Nevertheless, learning a generic representation of ETS data for various applications remains challenging due to the inherently complex hierarchical structure of ETS data. Moreover, ETS data exhibits intricate temporal dependencies and is suscepti ble to the influence of exogenous variables. Furthermore, different instances exhibit diverse electricity consumption behavior. In this paper, we propose a foundation model PowerPM to model ETS data, providing a large-scale, off-the-shelf model for power systems. PowerPM consists of a temporal encoder and a hierarchical encoder. The temporal encoder captures both temporal dependencies in ETS data, considering exogenous variables. The hierarchical encoder models the correlation between hierarchy. Furthermore, PowerPM leverages a novel self-supervised pretraining framework consisting of masked ETS modeling and dual-view contrastive learning, which enable PowerPM to capture temporal dependency within ETS windows and aware the discrepancy across ETS windows, providing two different perspectives to learn generic representation. Our experiments involve five real world scenario datasets, comprising private and public data. Through pre-training on massive ETS data, PowerPM achieves SOTA performance on diverse downstream tasks within the private dataset. Impressively, when transferred to the public datasets, PowerPM maintains its superiority, showcasing its remarkable generalization ability across various tasks and domains. Moreover, ablation studies, few-shot experiments provide additional evidence of the effectiveness of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

State-of-the-art methods typically employ fully supervised approaches, necessitating a huge labeled dataset acquired through expensive LiDAR sensors and meticulous voxel-wise labeling by human annotators. The resource-intensive nature of this annotating process significantly hampers the application and scalability of these methods. We introduce a novel semi-supervised framework to alleviate the dependency on densely annotated data. Our approach leverages 2D foundation models to generate essential 3D scene geometric and semantic cues, facilitating a more efficient training process. Our framework exhibits notable properties: (1) Generalizability, applicable to various 3D semantic scene completion approaches, including 2D-3D lifting and 3D-2D transformer methods. (2) Effectiveness, as demonstrated through experiments on SemanticKITTI and NYUv2, wherein our method achieves up to 85% of the fully-supervised performance using only 10% labeled data. This approach not only reduces the cost and labor associated with data annotation but also demonstrates the potential for broader adoption in camera-based systems for 3D semantic occupancy prediction.</p></details> |  |

While these models perform benchmark-leading on common language tasks and show exemplary task-independent emergent abilities, transferring them to novel out-of-domain tasks is only insufficiently explored. The implications of the statistical black-box approach - stochastic parrots - are prominently criticized in the language model research community; however, the significance for novel generative tasks is not. This work investigates the alignment between personalized language models and survey participants on a Moral Foundation Theory questionnaire. We adapt text-to-text models to different political personas and survey the questionnaire repetitively to generate a synthetic population of persona and model combinations. Analyzing the intra-group variance and cross-alignment shows significant differences across models and personas. Our findings indicate that adapted models struggle to represent the survey-captured assessment of political ideologies. Thus, using language models to mimic social interactions requires measurable improvements in in-context optimization or parameter manipulation to align with psychological and sociological stereotypes. Without quantifiable alignment, generating politically nuanced content remains unfeasible. To enhance these representations, we propose a testable framework to generate agents based on moral value statements for future research.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 tables |

Unlike language or image foundation models, many video foundation models are evaluated with differing parameters (such as sampling rate, number of frames, pretraining steps, etc.), making fair and robust comparisons challenging. Therefore, we present a carefully designed evaluation framework for measuring two core capabilities of video comprehension: appearance and motion understanding. Our findings reveal that existing video foundation models, whether text-supervised like UMT or InternVideo2, or self-supervised like V-JEPA, exhibit limitations in at least one of these capabilities. As an alternative, we introduce TWLV-I, a new video foundation model that constructs robust visual representations for both motion- and appearance-based videos. Based on the average top-1 accuracy of linear probing on five action recognition benchmarks, pretrained only on publicly accessible datasets, our model shows a 4.6%p improvement compared to V-JEPA (ViT-L) and a 7.7%p improvement compared to UMT (ViT-L). Even when compared to much larger models, our model demonstrates a 7.2%p improvement compared to DFN (ViT-H), a 2.7%p improvement compared to V-JEPA~(ViT-H) and a 2.8%p improvement compared to InternVideo2 (ViT-g). We provide embedding vectors obtained by TWLV-I from videos of several commonly used video benchmarks, along with evaluation source code that can directly utilize these embeddings.

OCT acquisition is fast, non-invasive, affordable, and scalable. Due to its broad applicability, massive numbers of OCT images have been accumulated in routine exams, making it possible to train large-scale foundation models that can generalize to various diagnostic tasks using OCT images. Nevertheless, existing foundation models for OCT only consider 2D image slices, overlooking the rich 3D structure. Here, we present OCTCube, a 3D foundation model pre-trained on 26,605 3D OCT volumes encompassing 1.62 million 2D OCT images. OCTCube is developed based on 3D masked autoencoders and exploits FlashAttention to reduce the larger GPU memory usage caused by modeling 3D volumes. OCTCube outperforms 2D models when predicting 8 retinal diseases in both inductive and cross-dataset settings, indicating that utilizing the 3D structure in the model instead of 2D data results in significant improvement. OCTCube further shows superior performance on cross-device prediction and when predicting systemic diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension, further demonstrating its strong generalizability. Finally, we propose a contrastive-self-supervised-learning-based OCT-IR pre-training framework (COIP) for cross-modality analysis on OCT and infrared retinal (IR) images, where the OCT volumes are embedded using OCTCube. We demonstrate that COIP enables accurate alignment between OCT and IR en face images. Collectively, OCTCube, a 3D OCT foundation model, demonstrates significantly better performance against 2D models on 27 out of 29 tasks and comparable performance on the other two tasks, paving the way for AI-based retinal disease diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

However, there remains a need to evaluate how these models perform when prompted with commonplace queries compared to domain-specific queries, which may be useful for benchmarking prior to fine-tuning for domain-specific downstream tasks. This study evaluates LLMs, specifically Gemma-2B and Gemma-7B, across diverse domains, including cybersecurity, medicine, and finance, compared to common knowledge queries. This study utilizes a comprehensive methodology to assess foundational models, which includes problem formulation, data analysis, and the development of ThroughCut, a novel outlier detection technique that automatically identifies response throughput outliers based on their conciseness. This methodological rigor enhances the credibility of the presented evaluation frameworks. This study focused on assessing inference time, response length, throughput, quality, and resource utilization and investigated the correlations between these factors. The results indicate that model size and types of prompts used for inference significantly influenced response length and quality. In addition, common prompts, which include various types of queries, generate diverse and inconsistent responses at irregular intervals. In contrast, domain-specific prompts consistently generate concise responses within a reasonable time. Overall, this study underscores the need for comprehensive evaluation frameworks to enhance the reliability of benchmarking procedures in multidomain AI research.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, and algorithms</p></details> |
| **[Affordances-Oriented Planning using Foundation Models for Continuous Vision-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05890v2)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based agents have demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance in vision-language navigation (VLN) task. However, existing LLM-based methods often focus only on solving high-level task planning by selecting nodes in predefined navigation graphs for movements, overlooking low-level control in navigation scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose AO-Planner, a novel Affordances-Oriented Planner for continuous VLN task. Our AO-Planner integrates various foundation models to achieve affordances-oriented low-level motion planning and high-level decision-making, both performed in a zero-shot setting. Specifically, we employ a Visual Affordances Prompting (VAP) approach, where the visible ground is segmented by SAM to provide navigational affordances, based on which the LLM selects potential candidate waypoints and plans low-level paths towards selected waypoints. We further propose a high-level PathAgent which marks planned paths into the image input and reasons the most probable path by comprehending all environmental information. Finally, we convert the selected path into 3D coordinates using camera intrinsic parameters and depth information, avoiding challenging 3D predictions for LLMs. Experiments on the challenging R2R-CE and RxR-CE datasets show that AO-Planner achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance (8.8% improvement on SPL). Our method can also serve as a data annotator to obtain pseudo-labels, distilling its waypoint prediction ability into a learning-based predictor. This new predictor does not require any waypoint data from the simulator and achieves 47% SR competing with supervised methods. We establish an effective connection between LLM and 3D world, presenting novel prospects for employing foundation models in low-level motion control.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, false negative samples, i.e., image-text pairs having the same semantics but incorrectly regarded as negatives, disrupt the visual-language pre-training process and affect the model's learning ability. This work aims to develop a retinal foundation model, called ViLReF, by pre-training on a paired dataset comprising 451,956 retinal images and corresponding diagnostic text reports. In our vision-language pre-training strategy, we leverage expert knowledge to facilitate the extraction of labels and propose a novel constraint, the Weighted Similarity Coupling Loss, to adjust the speed of pushing sample pairs further apart dynamically within the feature space. Furthermore, we employ a batch expansion module with dynamic memory queues, maintained by momentum encoders, to supply extra samples and compensate for the vacancies caused by eliminating false negatives. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple datasets for downstream classification and segmentation tasks. The experimental results demonstrate the powerful zero-shot and transfer learning capabilities of ViLReF, verifying the effectiveness of our pre-training strategy. Our ViLReF model is available at: https://github.com/T6Yang/ViLReF.</p></details> |  |

The narrative and unstructured nature of clinical notes is a major obstacle for healthcare intelligentization. We address a critical problem of structuring clinical notes into clinical data, according to international interoperability standards. We collect and annotate data for three subtasks, namely, international patient summary, clinical impression and medical encounter. We then supervised fine-tuned a state-of-the-art LLM using public and credentialed clinical data. The training is orchestrated in a way that the target model can first support basic clinical tasks such as abbreviation expansion and temporal information extraction, and then learn to perform more complex downstream clinical tasks. Moreover, we address several modeling challenges in the healthcare context, e.g., extra long context window. Our blind pairwise evaluation shows that SoftTiger outperforms other popular open-source models and GPT-3.5, comparable to Gemini-pro, with a mild gap from GPT-4. We believe that LLMs may become a step-stone towards healthcare digitalization and democratization. Therefore, we publicly release SoftTiger models at scales of 13 billion and 70 billion parameters, as well as datasets and code for our innovative scalable evaluation, hopefully, making a significant contribution to the healthcare industry.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2024 Spring Symposium on Clinical Foundation Models, Stanford University, Stanford, California</p></details> |

Traditional methods are labor-intensive and prone to human error. Digital pathology, which converts glass slides into high-resolution digital images for analysis by computer algorithms, revolutionizes the field by enhancing diagnostic accuracy, consistency, and efficiency through automated image analysis and large-scale data processing. Foundational transformer pretraining is crucial for developing robust, generalizable models as it enables learning from vast amounts of unannotated data. This paper introduces the Hibou family of foundational vision transformers for pathology, leveraging the DINOv2 framework to pretrain two model variants, Hibou-B and Hibou-L, on a proprietary dataset of over 1 million whole slide images (WSIs) representing diverse tissue types and staining techniques. Our pretrained models demonstrate superior performance on both patch-level and slide-level benchmarks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods. Notably, Hibou-L achieves the highest average accuracy across multiple benchmark datasets.

However, current approaches often struggle to effectively extract generalizable insights, frequently requiring extensive fine-tuning and limiting their versatility. Graph foundation models offer a transformative solution, with the potential to learn robust, generalizable representations from graph data. This enables more effective and adaptable applications across a wide spectrum of tasks and domains. In this work, we investigate a unified graph model, AnyGraph, designed to handle key challenges: i) Structure Heterogenity. Addressing distribution shift in graph structural information; ii) Feature Heterogenity. Handling diverse feature representation spaces across graph datasets; iii) Fast Adaptation. Efficiently adapting the model to new graph domains; iv) Scaling Law Emergence. Enabling the model to exhibit scaling law behavior, where its performance scales favorably with the amount of data and parameter sizes. To tackle these critical challenges, we build the AnyGraph upon a Graph Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. This approach empowers the model to effectively manage both the in-domain and cross-domain distribution shift concerning structure-level and feature-level heterogeneity. Furthermore, a lightweight graph expert routing mechanism is proposed to facilitate AnyGraph's fast adaptability to new data and domains. Our extensive experiments on diverse 38 graph datasets have demonstrated the strong zero-shot learning performance of AnyGraph across diverse graph domains with significant distribution shift. Furthermore, we have validated the model's fast adaptation ability and scaling law emergence, showcasing its versatility.</p></details> |  |

Current AI foundation models, although advanced by leveraging large and heterogeneous data, are often constrained by their size and data integration, limiting their effectiveness in addressing the full range of Earth system prediction challenges. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Oak Ridge Base Foundation Model for Earth System Predictability (ORBIT), an advanced vision transformer model that scales up to 113 billion parameters using a novel hybrid tensor-data orthogonal parallelism technique. As the largest model of its kind, ORBIT surpasses the current climate AI foundation model size by a thousandfold. Performance scaling tests conducted on the Frontier supercomputer have demonstrated that ORBIT achieves 684 petaFLOPS to 1.6 exaFLOPS sustained throughput, with scaling efficiency maintained at 41% to 85% across 49,152 AMD GPUs. These breakthroughs establish new advances in AI-driven climate modeling and demonstrate promise to significantly improve the Earth system predictability.</p></details> |  |

The challenge is the lack of labeled data for the training of foundation model. To handle this issue, a CLIP-style retinal image foundation model is developed in this paper. Our foundation model, RET-CLIP, is specifically trained on a dataset of 193,865 patients to extract general features of color fundus photographs (CFPs), employing a tripartite optimization strategy to focus on left eye, right eye, and patient level to reflect real-world clinical scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RET-CLIP outperforms existing benchmarks across eight diverse datasets spanning four critical diagnostic categories: diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, multiple disease diagnosis, and multi-label classification of multiple diseases, which demonstrate the performance and generality of our foundation model.

However, this approach introduces an urgent problem: current deep learning models are predominantly serial, meaning that as the number of network layers increases, so do the training and inference times. This is unacceptable if deep learning is to continue advancing. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep learning parallelization strategy based on the Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT). From this foundation, we designed a parallel network called Para-Former to test our theory. Unlike traditional serial models, the inference time of Para-Former does not increase with the number of layers, significantly accelerating the inference speed of multi-layer networks. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of this network.</p></details> |  |

In this landscape, cyber deception emerges as a critical component of our defense strategy against increasingly sophisticated attacks. This chapter aims to highlight the pivotal role of game-theoretic models and foundation models (FMs) in analyzing, designing, and implementing cyber deception tactics. Game models (GMs) serve as a foundational framework for modeling diverse adversarial interactions, allowing us to encapsulate both adversarial knowledge and domain-specific insights. Meanwhile, FMs serve as the building blocks for creating tailored machine learning models suited to given applications. By leveraging the synergy between GMs and FMs, we can advance proactive and automated cyber defense mechanisms by not only securing our networks against attacks but also enhancing their resilience against well-planned operations. This chapter discusses the games at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels of warfare, delves into the symbiotic relationship between these methodologies, and explores relevant applications where such a framework can make a substantial impact in cybersecurity. The chapter discusses the promising direction of the multi-agent neurosymbolic conjectural learning (MANSCOL), which allows the defender to predict adversarial behaviors, design adaptive defensive deception tactics, and synthesize knowledge for the operational level synthesis and adaptation. FMs serve as pivotal tools across various functions for MANSCOL, including reinforcement learning, knowledge assimilation, formation of conjectures, and contextual representation. This chapter concludes with a discussion of the challenges associated with FMs and their application in the domain of cybersecurity.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

But do their capabilities change depending on the input modality? In this work, we propose $\textbf{IsoBench}$, a benchmark dataset containing problems from four major areas: math, science, algorithms, and games. Each example is presented with multiple $\textbf{isomorphic representations}$ of inputs, such as visual, textual, and mathematical presentations. IsoBench provides fine-grained feedback to diagnose performance gaps caused by the form of the representation. Across various foundation models, we observe that on the same problem, models have a consistent preference towards textual representations. Most prominently, when evaluated on all IsoBench problems, Claude-3 Opus performs 28.7 points worse when provided with images instead of text; similarly, GPT-4 Turbo is 18.7 points worse and Gemini Pro is 14.9 points worse. Finally, we present two prompting techniques, $\textit{IsoCombination}$ and $\textit{IsoScratchPad}$, which improve model performance by considering combinations of, and translations between, different input representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>1st C...</summary><p>1st Conference on Language Modeling (COLM), 2024</p></details> |

To apply transformers across different data modalities, practitioners have to make specific clever data-modality-dependent constructions. In this paper, we propose Sampling Foundational Transformer (SFT) that can work on multiple data modalities (e.g., point cloud, graph, and sequence) and constraints (e.g., rotational-invariant). The existence of such model is important as contemporary foundational modeling requires operability on multiple data sources. For efficiency on large number of tokens, our model relies on our context aware sampling-without-replacement mechanism for both linear asymptotic computational complexity and real inference time gain. For efficiency, we rely on our newly discovered pseudoconvex formulation of transformer layer to increase model's convergence rate. As a model working on multiple data modalities, SFT has achieved competitive results on many benchmarks, while being faster in inference, compared to other very specialized models.</p></details> |  |

In the medical domain, however, the development of comprehensive foundation models is constrained by limited access to diverse modalities and stringent privacy regulations. To address these constraints, this study introduces a novel knowledge injection approach, FedKIM, designed to scale the medical foundation model within a federated learning framework. FedKIM leverages lightweight local models to extract healthcare knowledge from private data and integrates this knowledge into a centralized foundation model using a designed adaptive Multitask Multimodal Mixture Of Experts (M3OE) module. This method not only preserves privacy but also enhances the model's ability to handle complex medical tasks involving multiple modalities.

By leveraging a cross-silo federated learning approach, FEDMEKI circumvents the issues associated with centralized data collection, which is often prohibited under health regulations like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the USA. The platform is meticulously designed to handle multi-site, multi-modal, and multi-task medical data, which includes 7 medical modalities, including images, signals, texts, laboratory test results, vital signs, input variables, and output variables. The curated dataset to validate FEDMEKI covers 8 medical tasks, including 6 classification tasks (lung opacity detection, COVID-19 detection, electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormal detection, mortality prediction, sepsis prediction, and enlarged cardiomediastinum detection) and 2 generation tasks (medical visual question answering (MedVQA) and ECG noise clarification). This comprehensive dataset is partitioned across several clients to facilitate the decentralized training process under 16 benchmark approaches. FEDMEKI not only preserves data privacy but also enhances the capability of medical foundation models by allowing them to learn from a broader spectrum of medical knowledge without direct data exposure, thereby setting a new benchmark in the application of foundation models within the healthcare sector.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Neurips 2024 DB Track</p></details> |

Few-shot segmentation (FSS) methods show promise but often require retraining on the target domain and struggle to generalize across different modalities. Similarly, adapting foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for medical imaging has limitations, including the need for finetuning and domain-specific adaptation. To address these issues, we propose a novel method that adapts DINOv2 and Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) for retrieval-augmented few-shot medical image segmentation. Our approach uses DINOv2's feature as query to retrieve similar samples from limited annotated data, which are then encoded as memories and stored in memory bank. With the memory attention mechanism of SAM 2, the model leverages these memories as conditions to generate accurate segmentation of the target image. We evaluated our framework on three medical image segmentation tasks, demonstrating superior performance and generalizability across various modalities without the need for any retraining or finetuning. Overall, this method offers a practical and effective solution for few-shot medical image segmentation and holds significant potential as a valuable annotation tool in clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models often face limitations in generalization, struggling with zero-shot prediction on unseen regions and cities, as well as diminished long-term accuracy. This is primarily due to the inherent challenges in handling the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of traffic data, coupled with the significant distribution shift across time and space. In this work, we aim to unlock new possibilities for building versatile, resilient and adaptive spatio-temporal foundation models for traffic prediction. To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel foundation model, named OpenCity, that can effectively capture and normalize the underlying spatio-temporal patterns from diverse data characteristics, facilitating zero-shot generalization across diverse urban environments. OpenCity integrates the Transformer architecture with graph neural networks to model the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in traffic data. By pre-training OpenCity on large-scale, heterogeneous traffic datasets, we enable the model to learn rich, generalizable representations that can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of traffic forecasting scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that OpenCity exhibits exceptional zero-shot predictive performance. Moreover, OpenCity showcases promising scaling laws, suggesting the potential for developing a truly one-for-all traffic prediction solution that can adapt to new urban contexts with minimal overhead.

However, developing generalized artificial intelligence models for medical data often requires a large number of labeled images representing various disease signs, and most models are typically task-specific, focusing on major retinal diseases. In this study, we developed a Fundus-Specific Pretrained Model (Image+Fundus), a supervised artificial intelligence model trained to detect abnormalities in fundus images. A total of 57,803 images were used to develop this pretrained model, which achieved superior performance across various downstream tasks, indicating that our proposed model outperforms other general methods. Our Image+Fundus model offers a generalized approach to improve model performance while reducing the number of labeled datasets required. Additionally, it provides more disease-specific insights into fundus images, with visualizations generated by our model. These disease-specific foundation models are invaluable in enhancing the performance and efficiency of deep learning models in the field of fundus imaging.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

However, is it truly necessary to involve such vast amounts of data in pre-training, consuming extensive computational resources? This paper introduces data-effective learning, aiming to use data in the most impactful way to pre-train foundation models. This involves strategies that focus on data quality rather than quantity, ensuring the data used for training has high informational value. Data-effective learning plays a profound role in accelerating foundation model training, reducing computational costs, and saving data storage, which is very important as the volume of medical data in recent years has grown beyond many people's expectations. However, due to the lack of standards and comprehensive benchmarks, research on medical data-effective learning is poorly studied. To address this gap, our paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark specifically for evaluating data-effective learning in the medical field. This benchmark includes a dataset with millions of data samples from 31 medical centers (DataDEL), a baseline method for comparison (MedDEL), and a new evaluation metric (NormDEL) to objectively measure data-effective learning performance. Our extensive experimental results show the baseline MedDEL can achieve performance comparable to the original large dataset with only 5% of the data. Establishing such an open data-effective learning benchmark is crucial for the medical foundation model research community because it facilitates efficient data use, promotes collaborative breakthroughs, and fosters the development of cost-effective, scalable, and impactful healthcare solutions.</p></details> |  |

However, recent research questions this traditional notion, exploring whether an increase in pre-training data always leads to enhanced model performance. To address this issue, data-effective learning approaches have been introduced. However, current methods in this area lack a clear standard for sample selection. Our experiments reveal that by maximizing V-information, sample selection can be framed as an optimization problem, enabling effective improvement in model performance even with fewer samples. Under this guidance, we develop an optimal data-effective learning method (OptiDEL) to maximize V-information. The OptiDEL method generates hard samples to achieve or even exceed the performance of models trained on the full dataset while using substantially less data. We compare the OptiDEL method with state-of-the-art approaches finding that OptiDEL consistently outperforms existing approaches across different datasets, with foundation models trained on only 5% of the pre-training data surpassing the performance of those trained on the full dataset.</p></details> |  |

While depth and normal are geometrically related and highly complimentary, they present distinct challenges. SoTA monocular depth methods achieve zero-shot generalization by learning affine-invariant depths, which cannot recover real-world metrics. Meanwhile, SoTA normal estimation methods have limited zero-shot performance due to the lack of large-scale labeled data. To tackle these issues, we propose solutions for both metric depth estimation and surface normal estimation. For metric depth estimation, we show that the key to a zero-shot single-view model lies in resolving the metric ambiguity from various camera models and large-scale data training. We propose a canonical camera space transformation module, which explicitly addresses the ambiguity problem and can be effortlessly plugged into existing monocular models. For surface normal estimation, we propose a joint depth-normal optimization module to distill diverse data knowledge from metric depth, enabling normal estimators to learn beyond normal labels. Equipped with these modules, our depth-normal models can be stably trained with over 16 million of images from thousands of camera models with different-type annotations, resulting in zero-shot generalization to in-the-wild images with unseen camera settings. Our method enables the accurate recovery of metric 3D structures on randomly collected internet images, paving the way for plausible single-image metrology.

Yet, their potential in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) remains untapped due to the absence of comprehensive and globally representative hyperspectral datasets. To close this gap, we introduce SpectralEarth, a large-scale multi-temporal dataset designed to pretrain hyperspectral foundation models leveraging data from the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP). SpectralEarth comprises 538,974 image patches covering 415,153 unique locations from more than 11,636 globally distributed EnMAP scenes spanning two years of archive. Additionally, 17.5% of these locations include multiple timestamps, enabling multi-temporal HSI analysis. Utilizing state-of-the-art self-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms, we pretrain a series of foundation models on SpectralEarth. We integrate a spectral adapter into classical vision backbones to accommodate the unique characteristics of HSI. In tandem, we construct four downstream datasets for land-cover and crop-type mapping, providing benchmarks for model evaluation. Experimental results support the versatility of our models, showcasing their generalizability across different tasks and sensors. We also highlight computational efficiency during model fine-tuning. The dataset, models, and source code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[BAPLe: Backdoor Attacks on Medical Foundational Models using Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07440v2)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical foundation models are gaining prominence in the medical community for their ability to derive general representations from extensive collections of medical image-text pairs. Recent research indicates that these models are susceptible to backdoor attacks, which allow them to classify clean images accurately but fail when specific triggers are introduced. However, traditional backdoor attacks necessitate a considerable amount of additional data to maliciously pre-train a model. This requirement is often impractical in medical imaging applications due to the usual scarcity of data. Inspired by the latest developments in learnable prompts, this work introduces a method to embed a backdoor into the medical foundation model during the prompt learning phase. By incorporating learnable prompts within the text encoder and introducing imperceptible learnable noise trigger to the input images, we exploit the full capabilities of the medical foundation models (Med-FM). Our method, BAPLe, requires only a minimal subset of data to adjust the noise trigger and the text prompts for downstream tasks, enabling the creation of an effective backdoor attack. Through extensive experiments with four medical foundation models, each pre-trained on different modalities and evaluated across six downstream datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

Although sufficient data exists for some well-studied medical tasks, there remains a long tail of clinically relevant tasks with poor data availability. Recently, numerous foundation models have demonstrated high suitability for few-shot learning (FSL) and zero-shot learning (ZSL), potentially making them more accessible to practitioners. However, it remains unclear which foundation model performs best on FSL medical image analysis tasks and what the optimal methods are for learning from limited data. We conducted a comprehensive benchmark study of ZSL and FSL using 16 pretrained foundation models on 19 diverse medical imaging datasets. Our results indicate that BiomedCLIP, a model pretrained exclusively on medical data, performs best on average for very small training set sizes, while very large CLIP models pretrained on LAION-2B perform best with slightly more training samples. However, simply fine-tuning a ResNet-18 pretrained on ImageNet performs similarly with more than five training examples per class. Our findings also highlight the need for further research on foundation models specifically tailored for medical applications and the collection of more datasets to train these models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as an oral presentation in MICCAI 2024 2nd International Workshop on Foundation Models for General Medical AI</p></details> |

Our core design is a progressive training approach that unifies the masked video modeling, crossmodal contrastive learning, and next token prediction, scaling up the video encoder size to 6B parameters. At the data level, we prioritize spatiotemporal consistency by semantically segmenting videos and generating video-audio-speech captions. This improves the alignment between video and text.

Traditional TSF foundation models rely heavily on numerical data fitting. In contrast, the human brain is inherently skilled at processing visual information, prefer predicting future trends by observing visualized sequences. From a biomimetic perspective, utilizing models to directly process numerical sequences might not be the most effective route to achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This paper proposes ViTime, a novel Visual Intelligence-based foundation model for TSF. ViTime overcomes the limitations of numerical time series data fitting by utilizing visual data processing paradigms and employs a innovative data synthesis method during training, called Real Time Series (RealTS). Experiments on a diverse set of previously unseen forecasting datasets demonstrate that ViTime achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, even surpassing the best individually trained supervised models in some situations. These findings suggest that visual intelligence can significantly enhance time series analysis and forecasting, paving the way for more advanced and versatile models in the field.

These capabilities make FMs a valuable tool for a variety of tasks, including biomedical reasoning, hypothesis generation, and interpreting complex imaging data. In this review paper, we address the unique challenges associated with establishing an ethical and trustworthy biomedical AI ecosystem, with a particular focus on the development of FMs and their downstream applications. We explore strategies that can be implemented throughout the biomedical AI pipeline to effectively tackle these challenges, ensuring that these FMs are translated responsibly into clinical and translational settings. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of key stewardship and co-design principles that not only ensure robust regulation but also guarantee that the interests of all stakeholders, especially those involved in or affected by these clinical and translational applications are adequately represented. We aim to empower the biomedical AI community to harness these models responsibly and effectively. As we navigate this exciting frontier, our collective commitment to ethical stewardship, co-design, and responsible translation will be instrumental in ensuring that the evolution of FMs truly enhances patient care and medical decision making, ultimately leading to a more equitable and trustworthy biomedical AI ecosystem.</p></details> | 3 figures, 3 tables |
| **[A Novel Computational and Modeling Foundation for Automatic Coherence Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00598v2)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coherence is an essential property of well-written texts, that refers to the way textual units relate to one another. In the era of generative AI, coherence assessment is essential for many NLP tasks; summarization, generation, long-form question-answering, and more. However, in NLP {coherence} is an ill-defined notion, not having a formal definition or evaluation metrics, that would allow for large-scale automatic and systematic coherence assessment. To bridge this gap, in this work we employ the formal linguistic definition of \citet{Reinhart:1980} of what makes a discourse coherent, consisting of three conditions -- {\em cohesion, consistency} and {\em relevance} -- and formalize these conditions as respective computational tasks. We hypothesize that (i) a model trained on all of these tasks will learn the features required for coherence detection, and that (ii) a joint model for all tasks will exceed the performance of models trained on each task individually. On two benchmarks for coherence scoring rated by humans, one containing 500 automatically-generated short stories and another containing 4k real-world texts, our experiments confirm that jointly training on the proposed tasks leads to better performance on each task compared with task-specific models, and to better performance on assessing coherence overall, compared with strong baselines. We conclude that the formal and computational setup of coherence as proposed here provides a solid foundation for advanced methods of large-scale automatic assessment of coherence.</p></details> |  |

However, it is unclear if these models are robust to distribution shifts, and how their performance and generalization capabilities vary under changes in data distribution. In this project we strive to answer the question "Are vision-language foundational models robust to distribution shifts like human perception?" Specifically, we consider a diverse range of vision-language models and compare how the performance of these systems is affected by corruption based distribution shifts (such as \textit{motion blur, fog, snow, gaussian noise}) commonly found in practical real-world scenarios. We analyse the generalization capabilities qualitatively and quantitatively on zero-shot image classification task under aforementioned distribution shifts.

This study introduces a novel approach towards the creation of medical foundation models by integrating a large-scale multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset derived from 41,400 participants in its own. Our method involves a novel two-stage pretraining approach using vision transformers. The first stage is dedicated to encoding anatomical structures in generally healthy brains, identifying key features such as shapes and sizes of different brain regions. The second stage concentrates on spatial information, encompassing aspects like location and the relative positioning of brain structures. We rigorously evaluate our model, BrainFounder, using the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge and Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke v2.0 (ATLAS v2.0) datasets. BrainFounder demonstrates a significant performance gain, surpassing the achievements of the previous winning solutions using fully supervised learning. Our findings underscore the impact of scaling up both the complexity of the model and the volume of unlabeled training data derived from generally healthy brains, which enhances the accuracy and predictive capabilities of the model in complex neuroimaging tasks with MRI. The implications of this research provide transformative insights and practical applications in healthcare and make substantial steps towards the creation of foundation models for Medical AI.

These agents are postulated to excel across a myriad of tasks, potentially approaching general artificial intelligence. However, existing benchmarks fail to sufficiently challenge or showcase the full potential of LMMs in complex, real-world environments. To address this gap, we introduce VisualAgentBench (VAB), a comprehensive and pioneering benchmark specifically designed to train and evaluate LMMs as visual foundation agents across diverse scenarios, including Embodied, Graphical User Interface, and Visual Design, with tasks formulated to probe the depth of LMMs' understanding and interaction capabilities. Through rigorous testing across nine proprietary LMM APIs and eight open models, we demonstrate the considerable yet still developing agent capabilities of these models. Additionally, VAB constructs a trajectory training set constructed through hybrid methods including Program-based Solvers, LMM Agent Bootstrapping, and Human Demonstrations, promoting substantial performance improvements in LMMs through behavior cloning. Our work not only aims to benchmark existing models but also provides a solid foundation for future development into visual foundation agents.

| **[Adapting a Foundation Model for Space-based Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05924v1)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models, e.g., large language models, possess attributes of intelligence which offer promise to endow a robot with the contextual understanding necessary to navigate complex, unstructured tasks in the wild. In the future of space robotics, we see three core challenges which motivate the use of a foundation model adapted to space-based applications: 1) Scalability of ground-in-the-loop operations; 2) Generalizing prior knowledge to novel environments; and 3) Multi-modality in tasks and sensor data. Therefore, as a first-step towards building a foundation model for space-based applications, we automatically label the AI4Mars dataset to curate a language annotated dataset of visual-question-answer tuples. We fine-tune a pretrained LLaVA checkpoint on this dataset to endow a vision-language model with the ability to perform spatial reasoning and navigation on Mars' surface. In this work, we demonstrate that 1) existing vision-language models are deficient visual reasoners in space-based applications, and 2) fine-tuning a vision-language model on extraterrestrial data significantly improves the quality of responses even with a limited training dataset of only a few thousand samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Billion-scale Foundation Model for Remote Sensing Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05215v4)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the potential of foundation models in visual tasks has garnered significant attention, pretraining these models before downstream tasks has become a crucial step. The three key factors in pretraining foundation models are the pretraining method, the size of the pretraining dataset, and the number of model parameters. Recently, research in the remote sensing field has focused primarily on the pretraining method and the size of the dataset, with limited emphasis on the number of model parameters. This paper addresses this gap by examining the effect of increasing the number of model parameters on the performance of foundation models in downstream tasks such as rotated object detection and semantic segmentation. We pretrained foundation models with varying numbers of parameters, including 86M, 605.26M, 1.3B, and 2.4B, to determine whether performance in downstream tasks improved with an increase in parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first billion-scale foundation model in the remote sensing field. Furthermore, we propose an effective method for scaling up and fine-tuning a vision transformer in the remote sensing field. To evaluate general performance in downstream tasks, we employed the DOTA v2.0 and DIOR-R benchmark datasets for rotated object detection, and the Potsdam and LoveDA datasets for semantic segmentation. Experimental results demonstrated that, across all benchmark datasets and downstream tasks, the performance of the foundation models and data efficiency improved as the number of parameters increased. Moreover, our models achieve the state-of-the-art performance on several datasets including DIOR-R, Postdam, and LoveDA.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is the accepted version for IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing (IEEE J-STARS)</p></details> |

Generalist AI holds the potential to address these limitations due to its versatility in interpreting different data types and generating tailored outputs for diverse needs. However, existing biomedical generalist AI solutions are typically heavyweight and closed source to researchers, practitioners, and patients. Here, we propose BiomedGPT, the first open-source and lightweight vision-language foundation model, designed as a generalist capable of performing various biomedical tasks. BiomedGPT achieved state-of-the-art results in 16 out of 25 experiments while maintaining a computing-friendly model scale. We also conducted human evaluations to assess the capabilities of BiomedGPT in radiology visual question answering, report generation, and summarization. BiomedGPT exhibits robust prediction ability with a low error rate of 3.8% in question answering, satisfactory performance with an error rate of 8.3% in writing complex radiology reports, and competitive summarization ability with a nearly equivalent preference score to human experts. Our method demonstrates that effective training with diverse data can lead to more practical biomedical AI for improving diagnosis and workflow efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fix i...</summary><p>Fix incorrect citations and add journal reference for the published version.

Under default settings, HOI performance is nearly saturated, with many studies focusing on long-tail distribution and zero-shot/few-shot scenarios. Let us consider an intriguing problem:``What if there is only test dataset without training dataset, using multimodal visual foundation model in a training-free manner? '' This study uses two experimental settings: grounding truth and random arbitrary combinations. We get some interesting conclusion and find that the open vocabulary capabilities of the multimodal visual foundation model are not yet fully realized. Additionally, replacing the feature extraction with grounding DINO further confirms these findings.</p></details> |  |
| **[UrFound: Towards Universal Retinal Foundation Models via Knowledge-Guided Masked Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05618v1)** | 2024-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retinal foundation models aim to learn generalizable representations from diverse retinal images, facilitating label-efficient model adaptation across various ophthalmic tasks. Despite their success, current retinal foundation models are generally restricted to a single imaging modality, such as Color Fundus Photography (CFP) or Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), limiting their versatility. Moreover, these models may struggle to fully leverage expert annotations and overlook the valuable domain knowledge essential for domain-specific representation learning. To overcome these limitations, we introduce UrFound, a retinal foundation model designed to learn universal representations from both multimodal retinal images and domain knowledge. UrFound is equipped with a modality-agnostic image encoder and accepts either CFP or OCT images as inputs. To integrate domain knowledge into representation learning, we encode expert annotation in text supervision and propose a knowledge-guided masked modeling strategy for model pre-training. It involves reconstructing randomly masked patches of retinal images while predicting masked text tokens conditioned on the corresponding retinal image. This approach aligns multimodal images and textual expert annotations within a unified latent space, facilitating generalizable and domain-specific representation learning. Experimental results demonstrate that UrFound exhibits strong generalization ability and data efficiency when adapting to various tasks in retinal image analysis. By training on ~180k retinal images, UrFound significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art retinal foundation model trained on up to 1.6 million unlabelled images across 8 public retinal datasets. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/yukkai/UrFound.</p></details> |  |

However, evaluating MLLMs in low-level visual perception and understanding remains a yet-to-explore domain. To this end, we design benchmark settings to emulate human language responses related to low-level vision: the low-level visual perception (A1) via visual question answering related to low-level attributes (e.g. clarity, lighting); and the low-level visual description (A2), on evaluating MLLMs for low-level text descriptions. Furthermore, given that pairwise comparison can better avoid ambiguity of responses and has been adopted by many human experiments, we further extend the low-level perception-related question-answering and description evaluations of MLLMs from single images to image pairs. Specifically, for perception (A1), we carry out the LLVisionQA+ dataset, comprising 2,990 single images and 1,999 image pairs each accompanied by an open-ended question about its low-level features; for description (A2), we propose the LLDescribe+ dataset, evaluating MLLMs for low-level descriptions on 499 single images and 450 pairs. Additionally, we evaluate MLLMs on assessment (A3) ability, i.e. predicting score, by employing a softmax-based approach to enable all MLLMs to generate quantifiable quality ratings, tested against human opinions in 7 image quality assessment (IQA) datasets. With 24 MLLMs under evaluation, we demonstrate that several MLLMs have decent low-level visual competencies on single images, but only GPT-4V exhibits higher accuracy on pairwise comparisons than single image evaluations (like humans). We hope that our benchmark will motivate further research into uncovering and enhancing these nascent capabilities of MLLMs. Datasets will be available at https://github.com/Q-Future/Q-Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2309.14181</p></details> |

Traditional automatic segmentation methods often lack generalizability when applied to unseen datasets. Recently, the success of foundation models (FMs) has provided a more generalizable solution, potentially enabling the segmentation of any cell type. In this study, we perform a large-scale evaluation of three widely used state-of-the-art (SOTA) cell nuclei foundation models (Cellpose, StarDist, and CellViT). Specifically, we created a highly diverse evaluation dataset consisting of 2,542 kidney whole slide images (WSIs) collected from both human and rodent sources, encompassing various tissue types, sizes, and staining methods. To our knowledge, this is the largest-scale evaluation of its kind to date. Our quantitative analysis of the prediction distribution reveals a persistent performance gap in kidney pathology. Among the evaluated models, CellViT demonstrated superior performance in segmenting nuclei in kidney pathology. However, none of the foundation models are perfect; a performance gap remains in general nuclei segmentation for kidney pathology.</p></details> |  |

Conventional task-specific ECG analysis models require large numbers of expensive ECG annotations or associated labels to train. Transfer learning techniques have been shown to improve generalization and reduce reliance on labeled data. We present ECG-FM, an open foundation model for ECG analysis, and conduct a comprehensive study performed on a dataset of 1.66 million ECGs sourced from both publicly available and private institutional sources. ECG-FM adopts a transformer-based architecture and is pretrained on 2.5 million samples using ECG-specific augmentations and contrastive learning, as well as a continuous signal masking objective. Our transparent evaluation includes a diverse range of downstream tasks, where we predict ECG interpretation labels, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, and abnormal cardiac troponin. Affirming ECG-FM's effectiveness as a foundation model, we demonstrate how its command of contextual information results in strong performance, rich pretrained embeddings, and reliable interpretability. Due to a lack of open-weight practices, we highlight how ECG analysis is lagging behind other medical machine learning subfields in terms of foundation model adoption.

Recently, vision foundation models such as CLIP have gained significant attention, helping the vision community advance in finding robust, generalizable feature representations. With the majority of researchers within the wearable community relying on vision modalities to overcome the limited expressiveness of wearable data and accurately label their to-be-released benchmark datasets offline, we propose a novel, clustering-based annotation pipeline to significantly reduce the amount of data that needs to be annotated by a human annotator. We show that using our approach, the annotation of centroid clips suffices to achieve average labelling accuracies close to 90% across three publicly available HAR benchmark datasets. Using the weakly annotated datasets, we further demonstrate that we can match the accuracy scores of fully-supervised deep learning classifiers across all three benchmark datasets.

However, a key hurdle in achieving this goal lies in the robots' ability to manipulate objects in their unstructured surrounding environments according to different tasks. The learning-based approach is considered an effective way to address generalization. The impressive performance of foundation models in the fields of computer vision and natural language suggests the potential of embedding foundation models into manipulation tasks as a viable path toward achieving general manipulation capability. However, we believe achieving general manipulation capability requires an overarching framework akin to auto driving. This framework should encompass multiple functional modules, with different foundation models assuming distinct roles in facilitating general manipulation capability. This survey focuses on the contributions of foundation models to robot learning for manipulation. We propose a comprehensive framework and detail how foundation models can address challenges in each module of the framework. What's more, we examine current approaches, outline challenges, suggest future research directions, and identify potential risks associated with integrating foundation models into this domain.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by this progress, we explore the potential of foundation models for time-series forecasting in smart agriculture, a field often plagued by limited data availability. Specifically, this work presents a novel application of $\texttt{TimeGPT}$, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) time-series foundation model, to predict soil water potential ($\psi_\mathrm{soil}$), a key indicator of field water status that is typically used for irrigation advice. Traditionally, this task relies on a wide array of input variables. We explore $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$'s ability to forecast $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ in: ($i$) a zero-shot setting, ($ii$) a fine-tuned setting relying solely on historic $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ measurements, and ($iii$) a fine-tuned setting where we also add exogenous variables to the model. We compare $\texttt{TimeGPT}$'s performance to established SOTA baseline models for forecasting $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$. Our results demonstrate that $\texttt{TimeGPT}$ achieves competitive forecasting accuracy using only historical $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ data, highlighting its remarkable potential for agricultural applications. This research paves the way for foundation time-series models for sustainable development in agriculture by enabling forecasting tasks that were traditionally reliant on extensive data collection and domain expertise.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, accepted at KDD '24 - Fragile Earth Workshop https://openreview.net/forum?id=GZBGhi4JfE</p></details> |

Notably, it remains the only major step not fully integrated into widely used end-to-end neural models. This paper aims to address this theoretical gap by laying the foundations of tokenization from a formal perspective. By articulating and extending basic properties about the category of stochastic maps, we propose a unified framework for representing and analyzing tokenizer models. This framework allows us to establish general conditions for the use of tokenizers. In particular, we formally establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for a tokenizer model to preserve the consistency of statistical estimators. Additionally, we discuss statistical and computational concerns crucial for the design and implementation of tokenizer models. The framework and results advanced in this paper represent a step toward a robust theoretical foundation for neural language modeling.</p></details> |  |

However, capturing high-resolution ground truth canopy height using LiDAR is expensive and not available globally. An efficient alternative is to train a canopy height estimator to operate on single-view remotely sensed imagery. The primary obstacle to this approach is that these methods require significant training data to generalize well globally and across uncommon edge cases. Recent monocular depth estimation foundation models have show strong zero-shot performance even for complex scenes. In this paper we leverage the representations learned by these models to transfer to the remote sensing domain for measuring canopy height. Our findings suggest that our proposed Depth Any Canopy, the result of fine-tuning the Depth Anything v2 model for canopy height estimation, provides a performant and efficient solution, surpassing the current state-of-the-art with superior or comparable performance using only a fraction of the computational resources and parameters. Furthermore, our approach requires less than \$1.30 in compute and results in an estimated carbon footprint of 0.14 kgCO2.

| **[Anatomical Foundation Models for Brain MRIs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07079v1)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Learning (DL) in neuroimaging has become increasingly relevant for detecting neurological conditions and neurodegenerative disorders. One of the most predominant biomarkers in neuroimaging is represented by brain age, which has been shown to be a good indicator for different conditions, such as Alzheimer's Disease. Using brain age for pretraining DL models in transfer learning settings has also recently shown promising results, especially when dealing with data scarcity of different conditions. On the other hand, anatomical information of brain MRIs (e.g. cortical thickness) can provide important information for learning good representations that can be transferred to many downstream tasks. In this work, we propose AnatCL, an anatomical foundation model for brain MRIs that i.) leverages anatomical information with a weakly contrastive learning approach and ii.) achieves state-of-the-art performances in many different downstream tasks. To validate our approach we consider 12 different downstream tasks for diagnosis classification, and prediction of 10 different clinical assessment scores.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[AI Foundation Models in Remote Sensing: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03464v1)** | 2024-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have profoundly transformed the field of remote sensing, revolutionizing data collection, processing, and analysis. Traditionally reliant on manual interpretation and task-specific models, remote sensing has been significantly enhanced by the advent of foundation models--large-scale, pre-trained AI models capable of performing a wide array of tasks with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of foundation models in the remote sensing domain, covering models released between June 2021 and June 2024. We categorize these models based on their applications in computer vision and domain-specific tasks, offering insights into their architectures, pre-training datasets, and methodologies. Through detailed performance comparisons, we highlight emerging trends and the significant advancements achieved by these foundation models. Additionally, we discuss the technical challenges, practical implications, and future research directions, addressing the need for high-quality data, computational resources, and improved model generalization. Our research also finds that pre-training methods, particularly self-supervised learning techniques like contrastive learning and masked autoencoders, significantly enhance the performance and robustness of foundation models in remote sensing tasks such as scene classification, object detection, and other applications. This survey aims to serve as a resource for researchers and practitioners by providing a panorama of advances and promising pathways for continued development and application of foundation models in remote sensing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tool Learning with Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08354v3)** | 2024-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans possess an extraordinary ability to create and utilize tools, allowing them to overcome physical limitations and explore new frontiers. With the advent of foundation models, AI systems have the potential to be equally adept in tool use as humans. This paradigm, i.e., tool learning with foundation models, combines the strengths of specialized tools and foundation models to achieve enhanced accuracy, efficiency, and automation in problem-solving. Despite its immense potential, there is still a lack of a comprehensive understanding of key challenges, opportunities, and future endeavors in this field. To this end, we present a systematic investigation of tool learning in this paper. We first introduce the background of tool learning, including its cognitive origins, the paradigm shift of foundation models, and the complementary roles of tools and models. Then we recapitulate existing tool learning research into tool-augmented and tool-oriented learning. We formulate a general tool learning framework: starting from understanding the user instruction, models should learn to decompose a complex task into several subtasks, dynamically adjust their plan through reasoning, and effectively conquer each sub-task by selecting appropriate tools. We also discuss how to train models for improved tool-use capabilities and facilitate the generalization in tool learning. Considering the lack of a systematic tool learning evaluation in prior works, we experiment with 18 representative tools and show the potential of current foundation models in skillfully utilizing tools. Finally, we discuss several open problems that require further investigation for tool learning. In general, we hope this paper could inspire future research in integrating tools with foundation models.</p></details> |  |

The advent of Whole Slide Scanners and the development of deep learning technologies have significantly advanced the field, leading to extensive research and development in pathology AI (Artificial Intelligence). These advancements have contributed to reducing the workload of pathologists and supporting decision-making in treatment plans. Recently, large-scale AI models known as Foundation Models (FMs), which are more accurate and applicable to a wide range of tasks compared to traditional AI, have emerged, and expanded their application scope in the healthcare field. Numerous FMs have been developed in pathology, and there are reported cases of their application in various tasks, such as disease diagnosis, rare cancer diagnosis, patient survival prognosis prediction, biomarker expression prediction, and the scoring of immunohistochemical expression intensity. However, several challenges remain for the clinical application of FMs, which healthcare professionals, as users, must be aware of. Research is ongoing to address these challenges. In the future, it is expected that the development of Generalist Medical AI, which integrates pathology FMs with FMs from other medical domains, will progress, leading to the effective utilization of AI in real clinical settings to promote precision and personalized medicine.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |

Therefore, we introduce VisionUnite, a novel vision-language foundation model for ophthalmology enhanced with clinical knowledge. VisionUnite has been pretrained on an extensive dataset comprising 1.24 million image-text pairs, and further refined using our proposed MMFundus dataset, which includes 296,379 high-quality fundus image-text pairs and 889,137 simulated doctor-patient dialogue instances. Our experiments indicate that VisionUnite outperforms existing generative foundation models such as GPT-4V and Gemini Pro. It also demonstrates diagnostic capabilities comparable to junior ophthalmologists. VisionUnite performs well in various clinical scenarios including open-ended multi-disease diagnosis, clinical explanation, and patient interaction, making it a highly versatile tool for initial ophthalmic disease screening. VisionUnite can also serve as an educational aid for junior ophthalmologists, accelerating their acquisition of knowledge regarding both common and rare ophthalmic conditions. VisionUnite represents a significant advancement in ophthalmology, with broad implications for diagnostics, medical education, and understanding of disease mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Cox Models with Stochastic Gradient Descent: Theoretical Foundations and Practical Guidances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02839v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing Cox regression and its neural network variants poses substantial computational challenges in large-scale studies. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD), known for its scalability in model optimization, has recently been adapted to optimize Cox models. Unlike its conventional application, which typically targets a sum of independent individual loss, SGD for Cox models updates parameters based on the partial likelihood of a subset of data. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical foundation for optimizing Cox partial likelihood with SGD is largely underexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that the SGD estimator targets an objective function that is batch-size-dependent. We establish that the SGD estimator for the Cox neural network (Cox-NN) is consistent and achieves the optimal minimax convergence rate up to a polylogarithmic factor. For Cox regression, we further prove the $\sqrt{n}$-consistency and asymptotic normality of the SGD estimator, with variance depending on the batch size. Furthermore, we quantify the impact of batch size on Cox-NN training and its effect on the SGD estimator's asymptotic efficiency in Cox regression. These findings are validated by extensive numerical experiments and provide guidance for selecting batch sizes in SGD applications. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SGD in a real-world application where GD is unfeasible due to the large scale of data.</p></details> |  |

Foundation models pretrained with these methods serve as a good basis for downstream tasks. However, the gap between natural and histopathological images hinders the direct application of existing methods. In this work, we present PathoDuet, a series of pretrained models on histopathological images, and a new self-supervised learning framework in histopathology. The framework is featured by a newly-introduced pretext token and later task raisers to explicitly utilize certain relations between images, like multiple magnifications and multiple stains. Based on this, two pretext tasks, cross-scale positioning and cross-stain transferring, are designed to pretrain the model on Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) images and transfer the model to immunohistochemistry (IHC) images, respectively. To validate the efficacy of our models, we evaluate the performance over a wide variety of downstream tasks, including patch-level colorectal cancer subtyping and whole slide image (WSI)-level classification in H&E field, together with expression level prediction of IHC marker, tumor identification and slide-level qualitative analysis in IHC field. The experimental results show the superiority of our models over most tasks and the efficacy of proposed pretext tasks. The codes and models are available at https://github.com/openmedlab/PathoDuet.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Medical Image Analysis</p></details> |
| **[A Multimodal Knowledge-enhanced Whole-slide Pathology Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15362v2)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remarkable strides in computational pathology have been made in the task-agnostic foundation model that advances the performance of a wide array of downstream clinical tasks. Despite the promising performance, there are still several challenges. First, prior works have resorted to either vision-only or vision-captions data, disregarding invaluable pathology reports and gene expression profiles which respectively offer distinct knowledge for versatile clinical applications. Second, the current progress in pathology FMs predominantly concentrates on the patch level, where the restricted context of patch-level pretraining fails to capture whole-slide patterns. Here we curated the largest multimodal dataset consisting of H\&E diagnostic whole slide images and their associated pathology reports and RNA-Seq data, resulting in 26,169 slide-level modality pairs from 10,275 patients across 32 cancer types. To leverage these data for CPath, we propose a novel whole-slide pretraining paradigm which injects multimodal knowledge at the whole-slide context into the pathology FM, called Multimodal Self-TAught PRetraining (mSTAR). The proposed paradigm revolutionizes the workflow of pretraining for CPath, which enables the pathology FM to acquire the whole-slide context. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate multimodal knowledge at the slide level for enhancing pathology FMs, expanding the modelling context from unimodal to multimodal knowledge and from patch-level to slide-level. To systematically evaluate the capabilities of mSTAR, extensive experiments including slide-level unimodal and multimodal applications, are conducted across 7 diverse types of tasks on 43 subtasks, resulting in the largest spectrum of downstream tasks. The average performance in various slide-level applications consistently demonstrates significant performance enhancements for mSTAR compared to SOTA FMs.</p></details> | 45 pages, 9 figures |

Some common limitations in MOT are varying object appearances, occlusions, or crowded scenes. To address these challenges, machine learning methods have been extensively deployed, leveraging large datasets, sophisticated models, and substantial computational resources. Due to practical limitations, access to the above is not always an option. However, with the recent release of foundation models by prominent AI companies, pretrained models have been trained on vast datasets and resources using state-of-the-art methods. This work tries to leverage one such foundation model, called DINOv2, through using knowledge distillation. The proposed method uses a teacher-student architecture, where DINOv2 is the teacher and the FairMOT backbone HRNetv2 W18 is the student. The results imply that although the proposed method shows improvements in certain scenarios, it does not consistently outperform the original FairMOT model. These findings highlight the potential and limitations of applying foundation models in knowledge</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an MSc thesis by Niels Faber, supervised by the two other authors</p></details> |
| **[Towards AI-Safety-by-Design: A Taxonomy of Runtime Guardrails in Foundation Model based Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02205v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement and widespread deployment of foundation model (FM) based systems have revolutionized numerous applications across various domains. However, the fast-growing capabilities and autonomy have also raised significant concerns about responsible AI and AI safety. Recently, there have been increasing attention toward implementing guardrails to ensure the runtime behavior of FM-based systems is safe and responsible. Given the early stage of FMs and their applications (such as agents), the design of guardrails have not yet been systematically studied. It remains underexplored which software qualities should be considered when designing guardrails and how these qualities can be ensured from a software architecture perspective. Therefore, in this paper, we present a taxonomy for guardrails to classify and compare the characteristics and design options of guardrails. Our taxonomy is organized into three main categories: the motivation behind adopting runtime guardrails, the quality attributes to consider, and the design options available. This taxonomy provides structured and concrete guidance for making architectural design decisions when designing guardrails and highlights trade-offs arising from the design decisions.</p></details> | 15 Pages |
| **[Enhancing Whole Slide Pathology Foundation Models through Stain Normalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00380v2)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in digital pathology have led to the development of numerous foundational models that utilize self-supervised learning on patches extracted from gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs). While this approach leverages vast amounts of unlabeled data, we have discovered a significant issue: features extracted from these self-supervised models tend to cluster by individual WSIs, a phenomenon we term WSI-specific feature collapse. This problem can potentially limit the model's generalization ability and performance on various downstream tasks. To address this issue, we introduce Stain Normalized Pathology Foundational Model, a novel foundational model trained on patches that have undergone stain normalization. Stain normalization helps reduce color variability arising from different laboratories and scanners, enabling the model to learn more consistent features. Stain Normalized Pathology Foundational Model is trained using 285,153,903 patches extracted from a total of 34,795 WSIs, combining data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Our experiments demonstrate that Stain Normalized Pathology Foundational Model significantly mitigates the feature collapse problem, indicating that the model has learned more generalized features rather than overfitting to individual WSI characteristics. We compared Stain Normalized Pathology Foundational Model with state-of-the-art models across six downstream task datasets, and our results show that Stain Normalized Pathology Foundational Model achieves excellent performance relative to the number of WSIs used and the model's parameter count. This suggests that the application of stain normalization has substantially improved the model's efficiency and generalization capabilities.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Towards A Generalizable Pathology Foundation Model via Unified Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18449v2)** | 2024-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pretrained on large-scale datasets are revolutionizing the field of computational pathology (CPath). The generalization ability of foundation models is crucial for the success in various downstream clinical tasks. However, current foundation models have only been evaluated on a limited type and number of tasks, leaving their generalization ability and overall performance unclear. To address this gap, we established a most comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of off-the-shelf foundation models across six distinct clinical task types, encompassing a total of 39 specific tasks. Our findings reveal that existing foundation models excel at certain task types but struggle to effectively handle the full breadth of clinical tasks. To improve the generalization of pathology foundation models, we propose a unified knowledge distillation framework consisting of both expert and self knowledge distillation, where the former allows the model to learn from the knowledge of multiple expert models, while the latter leverages self-distillation to enable image representation learning via local-global alignment. Based on this framework, a Generalizable Pathology Foundation Model (GPFM) is pretrained on a large-scale dataset consisting of 190 million images from around 86,000 public H&E whole slides across 34 major tissue types. Evaluated on the established benchmark, GPFM achieves an impressive average rank of 1.36, with 29 tasks ranked 1st, while the the second-best model, UNI, attains an average rank of 2.96, with only 4 tasks ranked 1st. The superior generalization of GPFM demonstrates its exceptional modeling capabilities across a wide range of clinical tasks, positioning it as a new cornerstone for feature representation in CPath.</p></details> |  |
| **[Telecom Foundation Models: Applications, Challenges, and Future Trends](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03964v1)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Telecom networks are becoming increasingly complex, with diversified deployment scenarios, multi-standards, and multi-vendor support. The intricate nature of the telecom network ecosystem presents challenges to effectively manage, operate, and optimize networks. To address these hurdles, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been widely adopted to solve different tasks in telecom networks. However, these conventional AI models are often designed for specific tasks, rely on extensive and costly-to-collect labeled data that require specialized telecom expertise for development and maintenance. The AI models usually fail to generalize and support diverse deployment scenarios and applications. In contrast, Foundation Models (FMs) show effective generalization capabilities in various domains in language, vision, and decision-making tasks. FMs can be trained on multiple data modalities generated from the telecom ecosystem and leverage specialized domain knowledge. Moreover, FMs can be fine-tuned to solve numerous specialized tasks with minimal task-specific labeled data and, in some instances, are able to leverage context to solve previously unseen problems. At the dawn of 6G, this paper investigates the potential opportunities of using FMs to shape the future of telecom technologies and standards. In particular, the paper outlines a conceptual process for developing Telecom FMs (TFMs) and discusses emerging opportunities for orchestrating specialized TFMs for network configuration, operation, and maintenance. Finally, the paper discusses the limitations and challenges of developing and deploying TFMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Importance of Downstream Networks in Digital Pathology Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17804v3)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital pathology has significantly advanced disease detection and pathologist efficiency through the analysis of gigapixel whole-slide images (WSI). In this process, WSIs are first divided into patches, for which a feature extractor model is applied to obtain feature vectors, which are subsequently processed by an aggregation model to predict the respective WSI label. With the rapid evolution of representation learning, numerous new feature extractor models, often termed foundational models, have emerged. Traditional evaluation methods rely on a static downstream aggregation model setup, encompassing a fixed architecture and hyperparameters, a practice we identify as potentially biasing the results. Our study uncovers a sensitivity of feature extractor models towards aggregation model configurations, indicating that performance comparability can be skewed based on the chosen configurations. By accounting for this sensitivity, we find that the performance of many current feature extractor models is notably similar. We support this insight by evaluating seven feature extractor models across three different datasets with 162 different aggregation model configurations. This comprehensive approach provides a more nuanced understanding of the feature extractors' sensitivity to various aggregation model configurations, leading to a fairer and more accurate assessment of new foundation models in digital pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Gaze Object Prediction via Pixel-level Supervision from Vision Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01044v1)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaze object prediction (GOP) aims to predict the category and location of the object that a human is looking at. Previous methods utilized box-level supervision to identify the object that a person is looking at, but struggled with semantic ambiguity, ie, a single box may contain several items since objects are close together. The Vision foundation model (VFM) has improved in object segmentation using box prompts, which can reduce confusion by more precisely locating objects, offering advantages for fine-grained prediction of gaze objects. This paper presents a more challenging gaze object segmentation (GOS) task, which involves inferring the pixel-level mask corresponding to the object captured by human gaze behavior. In particular, we propose that the pixel-level supervision provided by VFM can be integrated into gaze object prediction to mitigate semantic ambiguity. This leads to our gaze object detection and segmentation framework that enables accurate pixel-level predictions. Different from previous methods that require additional head input or ignore head features, we propose to automatically obtain head features from scene features to ensure the model's inference efficiency and flexibility in the real world. Moreover, rather than directly fuse features to predict gaze heatmap as in existing methods, which may overlook spatial location and subtle details of the object, we develop a space-to-object gaze regression method to facilitate human-object gaze interaction. Specifically, it first constructs an initial human-object spatial connection, then refines this connection by interacting with semantically clear features in the segmentation branch, ultimately predicting a gaze heatmap for precise localization. Extensive experiments on GOO-Synth and GOO-Real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | Accepted by ECCV2024 |

There is a wide variety of knowledge patterns embedded in the graph data, such as node properties and clusters, which are crucial to learning generalized representations for GFMs. However, existing surveys of GFMs have several shortcomings: they lack comprehensiveness regarding the most recent progress, have unclear categorization of self-supervised methods, and take a limited architecture-based perspective that is restricted to only certain types of graph models. As the ultimate goal of GFMs is to learn generalized graph knowledge, we provide a comprehensive survey of self-supervised GFMs from a novel knowledge-based perspective. We propose a knowledge-based taxonomy, which categorizes self-supervised graph models by the specific graph knowledge utilized. Our taxonomy consists of microscopic (nodes, links, etc.), mesoscopic (context, clusters, etc.), and macroscopic knowledge (global structure, manifolds, etc.). It covers a total of 9 knowledge categories and more than 25 pretext tasks for pre-training GFMs, as well as various downstream task generalization strategies. Such a knowledge-based taxonomy allows us to re-examine graph models based on new architectures more clearly, such as graph language models, as well as provide more in-depth insights for constructing GFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 7 figures; work in progress</p></details> |

The more popular ones, such as Chat-GPT, are trained on large amounts of Internet data. However, it is becoming apparent that this data is likely to be exhausted soon, and technology companies are looking for new sources of data to train the next generation of foundation models. Reinforcement learning, RAG, prompt engineering and cognitive modelling are often used to fine-tune and augment the behaviour of foundation models. These techniques have been used to replicate people, such as Caryn Marjorie. These chatbots are not based on people's actual emotional and physiological responses to their environment, so they are, at best, a surface-level approximation to the characters they are imitating. To address these issues, we have developed a recording rig that captures what the wearer is seeing and hearing as well as their skin conductance (GSR), facial expression and brain state (14 channel EEG). AI algorithms are used to process this data into a rich picture of the environment and internal states of the subject. Foundation models trained on this data could replicate human behaviour much more accurately than the personality models that have been developed so far. This type of model has many potential applications, including recommendation, personal assistance, GAN systems, dating and recruitment. This paper gives some background to this work and describes the recording rig and preliminary tests of its functionality. It then suggests how a new type of foundation model could be created from the data captured by the rig and outlines some applications. Data gathering and model training are expensive, so we are currently working on the launch of a start-up that could raise funds for the next stage of the project.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2408.00030</p></details> |

The integration of the two has garnered significant attention from the AI research community. In this work, we attempt to provide an in-depth and comprehensive evaluation of the performance of MFM s on embodied task planning, aiming to shed light on their capabilities and limitations in this domain. To this end, based on the characteristics of embodied task planning, we first develop a systematic evaluation framework, which encapsulates four crucial capabilities of MFMs: object understanding, spatio-temporal perception, task understanding, and embodied reasoning. Following this, we propose a new benchmark, named MFE-ETP, characterized its complex and variable task scenarios, typical yet diverse task types, task instances of varying difficulties, and rich test case types ranging from multiple embodied question answering to embodied task reasoning. Finally, we offer a simple and easy-to-use automatic evaluation platform that enables the automated testing of multiple MFMs on the proposed benchmark. Using the benchmark and evaluation platform, we evaluated several state-of-the-art MFMs and found that they significantly lag behind human-level performance. The MFE-ETP is a high-quality, large-scale, and challenging benchmark relevant to real-world tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Histopathology Foundation Models for Ovarian Cancer Bevacizumab Treatment Response Prediction from Whole Slide Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20596v1)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bevacizumab is a widely studied targeted therapeutic drug used in conjunction with standard chemotherapy for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer. While its administration has shown to increase the progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced stage ovarian cancer, the lack of identifiable biomarkers for predicting patient response has been a major roadblock in its effective adoption towards personalized medicine. In this work, we leverage the latest histopathology foundation models trained on large-scale whole slide image (WSI) datasets to extract ovarian tumor tissue features for predicting bevacizumab response from WSIs. Our extensive experiments across a combination of different histopathology foundation models and multiple instance learning (MIL) strategies demonstrate capability of these large models in predicting bevacizumab response in ovarian cancer patients with the best models achieving an AUC score of 0.86 and an accuracy score of 72.5%. Furthermore, our survival models are able to stratify high- and low-risk cases with statistical significance (p < 0.05) even among the patients with the aggressive subtype of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma. This work highlights the utility of histopathology foundation models for the task of ovarian bevacizumab response prediction from WSIs. The high-attention regions of the WSIs highlighted by these models not only aid the model explainability but also serve as promising imaging biomarkers for treatment prognosis.</p></details> |  |
| **[The GPT Dilemma: Foundation Models and the Shadow of Dual-Use](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20442v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines the dual-use challenges of foundation models and the consequent risks they pose for international security. As artificial intelligence (AI) models are increasingly tested and deployed across both civilian and military sectors, distinguishing between these uses becomes more complex, potentially leading to misunderstandings and unintended escalations among states. The broad capabilities of foundation models lower the cost of repurposing civilian models for military uses, making it difficult to discern another state's intentions behind developing and deploying these models. As military capabilities are increasingly augmented by AI, this discernment is crucial in evaluating the extent to which a state poses a military threat. Consequently, the ability to distinguish between military and civilian applications of these models is key to averting potential military escalations. The paper analyzes this issue through four critical factors in the development cycle of foundation models: model inputs, capabilities, system use cases, and system deployment. This framework helps elucidate the points at which ambiguity between civilian and military applications may arise, leading to potential misperceptions. Using the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty as a case study, this paper proposes several strategies to mitigate the associated risks. These include establishing red lines for military competition, enhancing information-sharing protocols, employing foundation models to promote international transparency, and imposing constraints on specific weapon platforms. By managing dual-use risks effectively, these strategies aim to minimize potential escalations and address the trade-offs accompanying increasingly general AI models.</p></details> |  |

| **[Theia: Distilling Diverse Vision Foundation Models for Robot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20179v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-based robot policy learning, which maps visual inputs to actions, necessitates a holistic understanding of diverse visual tasks beyond single-task needs like classification or segmentation. Inspired by this, we introduce Theia, a vision foundation model for robot learning that distills multiple off-the-shelf vision foundation models trained on varied vision tasks. Theia's rich visual representations encode diverse visual knowledge, enhancing downstream robot learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Theia outperforms its teacher models and prior robot learning models using less training data and smaller model sizes. Additionally, we quantify the quality of pre-trained visual representations and hypothesize that higher entropy in feature norm distributions leads to improved robot learning performance.

| **[Boosting Graph Foundation Model from Structural Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19941v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph foundation models have recently attracted significant attention due to its strong generalizability. Although existing methods resort to language models to learn unified semantic representations across domains, they disregard the unique structural characteristics of graphs from different domains. To address the problem, in this paper, we boost graph foundation model from structural perspective and propose BooG. The model constructs virtual super nodes to unify structural characteristics of graph data from different domains. Specifically, the super nodes fuse the information of anchor nodes and class labels, where each anchor node captures the information of a node or a graph instance to be classified. Instead of using the raw graph structure, we connect super nodes to all nodes within their neighborhood by virtual edges. This new structure allows for effective information aggregation while unifying cross-domain structural characteristics. Additionally, we propose a novel pre-training objective based on contrastive learning, which learns more expressive representations for graph data and generalizes effectively to different domains and downstream tasks. Experimental results on various datasets and tasks demonstrate the superior performance of BooG. We provide our code and data here: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/BooG-EE42/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Foundation Models for Zero-Shot IoT Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19893v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models are increasingly deployed on edge Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, these models typically operate under supervised conditions and fail to recognize unseen classes different from training. To address this, zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to classify data of unseen classes with the help of semantic information. Foundation models (FMs) trained on web-scale data have shown impressive ZSL capability in natural language processing and visual understanding. However, leveraging FMs' generalized knowledge for zero-shot IoT sensing using signals such as mmWave, IMU, and Wi-Fi has not been fully investigated. In this work, we align the IoT data embeddings with the semantic embeddings generated by an FM's text encoder for zero-shot IoT sensing. To utilize the physics principles governing the generation of IoT sensor signals to derive more effective prompts for semantic embedding extraction, we propose to use cross-attention to combine a learnable soft prompt that is optimized automatically on training data and an auxiliary hard prompt that encodes domain knowledge of the IoT sensing task. To address the problem of IoT embeddings biasing to seen classes due to the lack of unseen class data during training, we propose using data augmentation to synthesize unseen class IoT data for fine-tuning the IoT feature extractor and embedding projector. We evaluate our approach on multiple IoT sensing tasks. Results show that our approach achieves superior open-set detection and generalized zero-shot learning performance compared with various baselines.

| **[Towards a Knowledge guided Multimodal Foundation Model for Spatio-Temporal Remote Sensing Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19660v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there is increased interest in foundation models for geoscience due to vast amount of earth observing satellite imagery. Existing remote sensing foundation models make use of the various sources of spectral imagery to create large models pretrained on masked reconstruction task. The embeddings from these foundation models are then used for various downstream remote sensing applications. In this paper we propose a foundational modeling framework for remote sensing geoscience applications, that goes beyond these traditional single modality masked autoencoder family of foundation models. This framework leverages the knowledge guided principles that the spectral imagery captures the impact of the physical drivers on the environmental system, and that the relationship between them is governed by the characteristics of the system. Specifically, our method, called MultiModal Variable Step Forecasting (MM-VSF), uses mutlimodal data (spectral imagery and weather) as its input and a variable step forecasting task as its pretraining objective. In our evaluation we show forecasting of satellite imagery using weather can be used as an effective pretraining task for foundation models. We further show the effectiveness of the embeddings from MM-VSF on the downstream task of pixel wise crop mapping, when compared with a model trained in the traditional setting of single modality input and masked reconstruction based pretraining.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Foundations for Unfairness in Anomaly Detection -- Case Studies in Facial Imaging Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19646v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep anomaly detection (AD) is perhaps the most controversial of data analytic tasks as it identifies entities that are then specifically targeted for further investigation or exclusion. Also controversial is the application of AI to facial imaging data. This work explores the intersection of these two areas to understand two core questions: "Who" these algorithms are being unfair to and equally important "Why". Recent work has shown that deep AD can be unfair to different groups despite being unsupervised with a recent study showing that for portraits of people: men of color are far more likely to be chosen to be outliers. We study the two main categories of AD algorithms: autoencoder-based and single-class-based which effectively try to compress all the instances with those that can not be easily compressed being deemed to be outliers. We experimentally verify sources of unfairness such as the under-representation of a group (e.g. people of color are relatively rare), spurious group features (e.g. men are often photographed with hats), and group labeling noise (e.g. race is subjective). We conjecture that lack of compressibility is the main foundation and the others cause it but experimental results show otherwise and we present a natural hierarchy amongst them.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures, AAAI/ACM AIES24</p></details> |
| **[Foundation Models for the Digital Twin Creation of Cyber-Physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18779v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are trained on a large amount of data to learn generic patterns. Consequently, these models can be used and fine-tuned for various purposes. Naturally, studying such models' use in the context of digital twins for cyber-physical systems (CPSs) is a relevant area of investigation. To this end, we provide perspectives on various aspects within the context of developing digital twins for CPSs, where foundation models can be used to increase the efficiency of creating digital twins, improve the effectiveness of the capabilities they provide, and used as specialized fine-tuned foundation models acting as digital twins themselves. We also discuss challenges in using foundation models in a more generic context. We use the case of an autonomous driving system as a representative CPS to give examples. Finally, we provide discussions and open research directions that we believe are valuable for the digital twin community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Representation of High-frequency Components for Medical Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14651v2)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have recently attracted significant attention for their impressive generalizability across diverse downstream tasks. However, these models are demonstrated to exhibit great limitations in representing high-frequency components and fine-grained details. In many medical imaging tasks, the precise representation of such information is crucial due to the inherently intricate anatomical structures, sub-visual features, and complex boundaries involved. Consequently, the limited representation of prevalent foundation models can result in significant performance degradation or even failure in these tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel pretraining strategy, named Frequency-advanced Representation Autoencoder (Frepa). Through high-frequency masking and low-frequency perturbation combined with adversarial learning, Frepa encourages the encoder to effectively represent and preserve high-frequency components in the image embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an innovative histogram-equalized image masking strategy, extending the Masked Autoencoder approach beyond ViT to other architectures such as Swin Transformer and convolutional networks. We develop Frepa across nine medical modalities and validate it on 32 downstream tasks for both 2D images and 3D volume data. Without fine-tuning, Frepa can outperform other self-supervised pretraining methods and, in some cases, even surpasses task-specific trained models. This improvement is particularly significant for tasks involving fine-grained details, such as achieving up to a +15% increase in DSC for retina vessel segmentation and a +7% increase in IoU for lung nodule detection. Further experiments quantitatively reveal that Frepa enables superior high-frequency representations and preservation in the embeddings, underscoring its potential for developing more generalized and universal medical image foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Opportunities of (Re)-Exploring Atmospheric Science by Foundation Models: A Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17842v1)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most state-of-the-art AI applications in atmospheric science are based on classic deep learning approaches. However, such approaches cannot automatically integrate multiple complicated procedures to construct an intelligent agent, since each functionality is enabled by a separate model learned from independent climate datasets. The emergence of foundation models, especially multimodal foundation models, with their ability to process heterogeneous input data and execute complex tasks, offers a substantial opportunity to overcome this challenge. In this report, we want to explore a central question - how the state-of-the-art foundation model, i.e., GPT-4o, performs various atmospheric scientific tasks. Toward this end, we conduct a case study by categorizing the tasks into four main classes, including climate data processing, physical diagnosis, forecast and prediction, and adaptation and mitigation. For each task, we comprehensively evaluate the GPT-4o's performance along with a concrete discussion. We hope that this report may shed new light on future AI applications and research in atmospheric science.</p></details> | 28 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Feature Re-Embedding: Towards Foundation Model-Level Performance in Computational Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17228v4)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) is the most widely used framework in computational pathology, encompassing sub-typing, diagnosis, prognosis, and more. However, the existing MIL paradigm typically requires an offline instance feature extractor, such as a pre-trained ResNet or a foundation model. This approach lacks the capability for feature fine-tuning within the specific downstream tasks, limiting its adaptability and performance. To address this issue, we propose a Re-embedded Regional Transformer (R$^2$T) for re-embedding the instance features online, which captures fine-grained local features and establishes connections across different regions. Unlike existing works that focus on pre-training powerful feature extractor or designing sophisticated instance aggregator, R$^2$T is tailored to re-embed instance features online. It serves as a portable module that can seamlessly integrate into mainstream MIL models. Extensive experimental results on common computational pathology tasks validate that: 1) feature re-embedding improves the performance of MIL models based on ResNet-50 features to the level of foundation model features, and further enhances the performance of foundation model features; 2) the R$^2$T can introduce more significant performance improvements to various MIL models; 3) R$^2$T-MIL, as an R$^2$T-enhanced AB-MIL, outperforms other latest methods by a large margin.The code is available at: https://github.com/DearCaat/RRT-MIL.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2024 |
| **[A Large Encoder-Decoder Family of Foundation Models For Chemical Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20267v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale pre-training methodologies for chemical language models represent a breakthrough in cheminformatics. These methods excel in tasks such as property prediction and molecule generation by learning contextualized representations of input tokens through self-supervised learning on large unlabeled corpora. Typically, this involves pre-training on unlabeled data followed by fine-tuning on specific tasks, reducing dependence on annotated datasets and broadening chemical language representation understanding. This paper introduces a large encoder-decoder chemical foundation models pre-trained on a curated dataset of 91 million SMILES samples sourced from PubChem, which is equivalent to 4 billion of molecular tokens. The proposed foundation model supports different complex tasks, including quantum property prediction, and offer flexibility with two main variants (289M and $8\times289M$). Our experiments across multiple benchmark datasets validate the capacity of the proposed model in providing state-of-the-art results for different tasks. We also provide a preliminary assessment of the compositionality of the embedding space as a prerequisite for the reasoning tasks. We demonstrate that the produced latent space is separable compared to the state-of-the-art with few-shot learning capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 3 figures, 14 tables</p></details> |
| **[On the Utility of Speech and Audio Foundation Models for Marmoset Call Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16417v2)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Marmoset monkeys encode vital information in their calls and serve as a surrogate model for neuro-biologists to understand the evolutionary origins of human vocal communication. Traditionally analyzed with signal processing-based features, recent approaches have utilized self-supervised models pre-trained on human speech for feature extraction, capitalizing on their ability to learn a signal's intrinsic structure independently of its acoustic domain. However, the utility of such foundation models remains unclear for marmoset call analysis in terms of multi-class classification, bandwidth, and pre-training domain. This study assesses feature representations derived from speech and general audio domains, across pre-training bandwidths of 4, 8, and 16 kHz for marmoset call-type and caller classification tasks. Results show that models with higher bandwidth improve performance, and pre-training on speech or general audio yields comparable results, improving over a spectral baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Interspeech 2024 satellite event (VIHAR 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Mapping the individual, social, and biospheric impacts of Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17129v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Responding to the rapid roll-out and large-scale commercialization of foundation models, large language models, and generative AI, an emerging body of work is shedding light on the myriad impacts these technologies are having across society. Such research is expansive, ranging from the production of discriminatory, fake and toxic outputs, and privacy and copyright violations, to the unjust extraction of labor and natural resources. The same has not been the case in some of the most prominent AI governance initiatives in the global north like the UK's AI Safety Summit and the G7's Hiroshima process, which have influenced much of the international dialogue around AI governance. Despite the wealth of cautionary tales and evidence of algorithmic harm, there has been an ongoing over-emphasis within the AI governance discourse on technical matters of safety and global catastrophic or existential risks. This narrowed focus has tended to draw attention away from very pressing social and ethical challenges posed by the current brute-force industrialization of AI applications. To address such a visibility gap between real-world consequences and speculative risks, this paper offers a critical framework to account for the social, political, and environmental dimensions of foundation models and generative AI. We identify 14 categories of risks and harms and map them according to their individual, social, and biospheric impacts. We argue that this novel typology offers an integrative perspective to address the most urgent negative impacts of foundation models and their downstream applications. We conclude with recommendations on how this typology could be used to inform technical and normative interventions to advance responsible AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM C...</summary><p>ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT '24).

| **[AesExpert: Towards Multi-modality Foundation Model for Image Aesthetics Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09624v3)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The highly abstract nature of image aesthetics perception (IAP) poses significant challenge for current multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The lack of human-annotated multi-modality aesthetic data further exacerbates this dilemma, resulting in MLLMs falling short of aesthetics perception capabilities. To address the above challenge, we first introduce a comprehensively annotated Aesthetic Multi-Modality Instruction Tuning (AesMMIT) dataset, which serves as the footstone for building multi-modality aesthetics foundation models. Specifically, to align MLLMs with human aesthetics perception, we construct a corpus-rich aesthetic critique database with 21,904 diverse-sourced images and 88K human natural language feedbacks, which are collected via progressive questions, ranging from coarse-grained aesthetic grades to fine-grained aesthetic descriptions. To ensure that MLLMs can handle diverse queries, we further prompt GPT to refine the aesthetic critiques and assemble the large-scale aesthetic instruction tuning dataset, i.e. AesMMIT, which consists of 409K multi-typed instructions to activate stronger aesthetic capabilities. Based on the AesMMIT database, we fine-tune the open-sourced general foundation models, achieving multi-modality Aesthetic Expert models, dubbed AesExpert. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed AesExpert models deliver significantly better aesthetic perception performances than the state-of-the-art MLLMs, including the most advanced GPT-4V and Gemini-Pro-Vision.

Through a unified framework, PartGLEE accomplishes detection, segmentation, and grounding of instances at any granularity in the open world scenario.

| **[Histopathology image embedding based on foundation models features aggregation for patient treatment response prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03954v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the response of a patient to a cancer treatment is of high interest. Nonetheless, this task is still challenging from a medical point of view due to the complexity of the interaction between the patient organism and the considered treatment. Recent works on foundation models pre-trained with self-supervised learning on large-scale unlabeled histopathology datasets have opened a new direction towards the development of new methods for cancer diagnosis related tasks. In this article, we propose a novel methodology for predicting Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma patients treatment response from Whole Slide Images. Our method exploits several foundation models as feature extractors to obtain a local representation of the image corresponding to a small region of the tissue, then, a global representation of the image is obtained by aggregating these local representations using attention-based Multiple Instance Learning. Our experimental study conducted on a dataset of 152 patients, shows the promising results of our methodology, notably by highlighting the advantage of using foundation models compared to conventional ImageNet pre-training. Moreover, the obtained results clearly demonstrates the potential of foundation models for characterizing histopathology images and generating more suited semantic representation for this task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI 2024 workshop MOVI</p></details> |
