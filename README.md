| **[Learning to Imitate Spatial Organization in Multi-robot Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11592v2)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding collective behavior and how it evolves is important to ensure that robot swarms can be trusted in a shared environment. One way to understand the behavior of the swarm is through collective behavior reconstruction using prior demonstrations. Existing approaches often require access to the swarm controller which may not be available. We reconstruct collective behaviors in distinct swarm scenarios involving shared environments without using swarm controller information. We achieve this by transforming prior demonstrations into features that describe multi-agent interactions before behavior reconstruction with multi-agent generative adversarial imitation learning (MA-GAIL). We show that our approach outperforms existing algorithms in spatial organization, and can be used to observe and reconstruct a swarm's behavior for further analysis and testing, which might be impractical or undesirable on the original robot swarm.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures.

Understanding these patterns is crucial in spatial analysis, but interpreting the statistic can be difficult. To simplify this process, we introduce three novel visualizations that enhance the interpretation of Local Moran's I results. These visualizations can be interactively linked to one another, and to established visualizations, to offer a more holistic exploration of the results. We provide a JavaScript library with implementations of these new visual elements, along with a web dashboard that demonstrates their integrated use.</p></details> |  |
| **[Group Multi-View Transformer for 3D Shape Analysis with Spatial Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16477v3)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the results of view-based 3D shape recognition methods have saturated, and models with excellent performance cannot be deployed on memory-limited devices due to their huge size of parameters. To address this problem, we introduce a compression method based on knowledge distillation for this field, which largely reduces the number of parameters while preserving model performance as much as possible. Specifically, to enhance the capabilities of smaller models, we design a high-performing large model called Group Multi-view Vision Transformer (GMViT). In GMViT, the view-level ViT first establishes relationships between view-level features. Additionally, to capture deeper features, we employ the grouping module to enhance view-level features into group-level features. Finally, the group-level ViT aggregates group-level features into complete, well-formed 3D shape descriptors. Notably, in both ViTs, we introduce spatial encoding of camera coordinates as innovative position embeddings. Furthermore, we propose two compressed versions based on GMViT, namely GMViT-simple and GMViT-mini. To enhance the training effectiveness of the small models, we introduce a knowledge distillation method throughout the GMViT process, where the key outputs of each GMViT component serve as distillation targets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. The large model GMViT achieves excellent 3D classification and retrieval results on the benchmark datasets ModelNet, ShapeNetCore55, and MCB. The smaller models, GMViT-simple and GMViT-mini, reduce the parameter size by 8 and 17.6 times, respectively, and improve shape recognition speed by 1.5 times on average, while preserving at least 90% of the classification and retrieval performance. The code is available at https://github.com/bigdata-graph/GMViT.</p></details> | 13pages, 8 figuers |
| **[REVISION: Rendering Tools Enable Spatial Fidelity in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02231v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Image (T2I) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been adopted in solutions for several computer vision and multimodal learning tasks. However, it has been found that such vision-language models lack the ability to correctly reason over spatial relationships. To tackle this shortcoming, we develop the REVISION framework which improves spatial fidelity in vision-language models. REVISION is a 3D rendering based pipeline that generates spatially accurate synthetic images, given a textual prompt. REVISION is an extendable framework, which currently supports 100+ 3D assets, 11 spatial relationships, all with diverse camera perspectives and backgrounds. Leveraging images from REVISION as additional guidance in a training-free manner consistently improves the spatial consistency of T2I models across all spatial relationships, achieving competitive performance on the VISOR and T2I-CompBench benchmarks. We also design RevQA, a question-answering benchmark to evaluate the spatial reasoning abilities of MLLMs, and find that state-of-the-art models are not robust to complex spatial reasoning under adversarial settings. Our results and findings indicate that utilizing rendering-based frameworks is an effective approach for developing spatially-aware generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024.

| **[Probabilistic Design of Multi-Dimensional Spatially-Coupled Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15166v4)** | 2024-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Because of their excellent asymptotic and finite-length performance, spatially-coupled (SC) codes are a class of low-density parity-check codes that is gaining increasing attention. Multi-dimensional (MD) SC codes are constructed by connecting copies of an SC code via relocations in order to mitigate various sources of non-uniformity and improve performance in many data storage and data transmission systems. As the number of degrees of freedom in the MD-SC code design increases, appropriately exploiting them becomes more difficult because of the complexity growth of the design process. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic framework for the MD-SC code design, which is based on the gradient-descent (GD) algorithm, to design better MD codes and address this challenge. In particular, we express the expected number of short cycles, which we seek to minimize, in the graph representation of the code in terms of entries of a probability-distribution matrix that characterizes the MD-SC code design. We then find a locally-optimal probability distribution, which serves as the starting point of a finite-length algorithmic optimizer that produces the final MD-SC code. We offer the theoretical analysis as well as the algorithms, and we present experimental results demonstrating that our MD codes, conveniently called GD-MD codes, have notably lower short cycle numbers compared with the available state-of-the-art. Moreover, our algorithms converge on solutions in few iterations, which confirms the complexity reduction as a result of limiting the search space via the locally-optimal GD-MD distributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages (double column), 5 figures, the short version has been accepted at the IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)</p></details> |
| **[Where Do We Go from Here? Multi-scale Allocentric Relational Inference from Natural Spatial Descriptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16364v2)** | 2024-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When communicating routes in natural language, the concept of acquired spatial knowledge is crucial for geographic information retrieval (GIR) and in spatial cognitive research. However, NLP navigation studies often overlook the impact of such acquired knowledge on textual descriptions. Current navigation studies concentrate on egocentric local descriptions (e.g., `it will be on your right') that require reasoning over the agent's local perception. These instructions are typically given as a sequence of steps, with each action-step explicitly mentioning and being followed by a landmark that the agent can use to verify they are on the right path (e.g., `turn right and then you will see...'). In contrast, descriptions based on knowledge acquired through a map provide a complete view of the environment and capture its overall structure. These instructions (e.g., `it is south of Central Park and a block north of a police station') are typically non-sequential, contain allocentric relations, with multiple spatial relations and implicit actions, without any explicit verification. This paper introduces the Rendezvous (RVS) task and dataset, which includes 10,404 examples of English geospatial instructions for reaching a target location using map-knowledge. Our analysis reveals that RVS exhibits a richer use of spatial allocentric relations, and requires resolving more spatial relations simultaneously compared to previous text-based navigation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SSUMamba: Spatial-Spectral Selective State Space Model for Hyperspectral Image Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01726v7)** | 2024-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising is a crucial preprocessing step for hyperspectral images (HSIs) due to noise arising from intra-imaging mechanisms and environmental factors. Long-range spatial-spectral correlation modeling is beneficial for HSI denoising but often comes with high computational complexity. Based on the state space model (SSM), Mamba is known for its remarkable long-range dependency modeling capabilities and computational efficiency. Building on this, we introduce a memory-efficient spatial-spectral UMamba (SSUMamba) for HSI denoising, with the spatial-spectral continuous scan (SSCS) Mamba being the core component. SSCS Mamba alternates the row, column, and band in six different orders to generate the sequence and uses the bidirectional SSM to exploit long-range spatial-spectral dependencies. In each order, the images are rearranged between adjacent scans to ensure spatial-spectral continuity. Additionally, 3D convolutions are embedded into the SSCS Mamba to enhance local spatial-spectral modeling. Experiments demonstrate that SSUMamba achieves superior denoising results with lower memory consumption per batch compared to transformer-based methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/lronkitty/SSUMamba.</p></details> |  |
| **[Principal component analysis balancing prediction and approximation accuracy for spatial data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01662v1)** | 2024-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dimension reduction is often the first step in statistical modeling or prediction of multivariate spatial data. However, most existing dimension reduction techniques do not account for the spatial correlation between observations and do not take the downstream modeling task into consideration when finding the lower-dimensional representation. We formalize the closeness of approximation to the original data and the utility of lower-dimensional scores for downstream modeling as two complementary, sometimes conflicting, metrics for dimension reduction. We illustrate how existing methodologies fall into this framework and propose a flexible dimension reduction algorithm that achieves the optimal trade-off. We derive a computationally simple form for our algorithm and illustrate its performance through simulation studies, as well as two applications in air pollution modeling and spatial transcriptomics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Design-Based Inference for Spatial Experiments under Unknown Interference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13599v5)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider design-based causal inference for spatial experiments in which treatments may have effects that bleed out and feed back in complex ways. Such spatial spillover effects violate the standard ``no interference'' assumption for standard causal inference methods. The complexity of spatial spillover effects also raises the risk of misspecification and bias in model-based analyses. We offer an approach for robust inference in such settings without having to specify a parametric outcome model. We define a spatial ``average marginalized effect'' (AME) that characterizes how, in expectation, units of observation that are a specified distance from an intervention location are affected by treatment at that location, averaging over effects emanating from other intervention nodes. We show that randomization is sufficient for non-parametric identification of the AME even if the nature of interference is unknown. Under mild restrictions on the extent of interference, we establish asymptotic distributions of estimators and provide methods for both sample-theoretic and randomization-based inference. We show conditions under which the AME recovers a structural effect. We illustrate our approach with a simulation study. Then we re-analyze a randomized field experiment and a quasi-experiment on forest conservation, showing how our approach offers robust inference on policy-relevant spillover effects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Spectral Morphological Mamba for Hyperspectral Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01372v1)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Transformers have garnered significant attention for Hyperspectral Image Classification (HSIC) due to their self-attention mechanism, which provides strong classification performance. However, these models face major challenges in computational efficiency, as their complexity increases quadratically with the sequence length. The Mamba architecture, leveraging a State Space Model, offers a more efficient alternative to Transformers. This paper introduces the Spatial-Spectral Morphological Mamba (MorpMamba) model. In the MorpMamba model, a token generation module first converts the Hyperspectral Image (HSI) patch into spatial-spectral tokens. These tokens are then processed by a morphology block, which computes structural and shape information using depthwise separable convolutional operations. The extracted information is enhanced in a feature enhancement module that adjusts the spatial and spectral tokens based on the center region of the HSI sample, allowing for effective information fusion within each block. Subsequently, the tokens are refined in a multi-head self-attention block to further improve the feature space. Finally, the combined information is fed into the state space block for classification and the creation of the ground truth map. Experiments on widely used Hyperspectral (HS) datasets demonstrate that the MorpMamba model outperforms (parametric efficiency) both CNN and Transformer models.</p></details> |  |
| **[WaveMamba: Spatial-Spectral Wavelet Mamba for Hyperspectral Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01231v1)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) has proven to be a powerful tool for capturing detailed spectral and spatial information across diverse applications. Despite the advancements in Deep Learning (DL) and Transformer architectures for HSI Classification (HSIC), challenges such as computational efficiency and the need for extensive labeled data persist. This paper introduces WaveMamba, a novel approach that integrates wavelet transformation with the Spatial-Spectral Mamba architecture to enhance HSIC. WaveMamba captures both local texture patterns and global contextual relationships in an end-to-end trainable model. The Wavelet-based enhanced features are then processed through the state-space architecture to model spatial-spectral relationships and temporal dependencies. The experimental results indicate that WaveMamba surpasses existing models, achieving an accuracy improvement of 4.5\% on the University of Houston dataset and a 2.0\% increase on the Pavia University dataset. These findings validate its effectiveness in addressing the complex data interactions inherent in HSIs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-head Spatial-Spectral Mamba for Hyperspectral Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01224v1)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial-Spectral Mamba (SSM) improves computational efficiency and captures long-range dependencies, addressing Transformer limitations. However, traditional Mamba models overlook rich spectral information in HSIs and struggle with high dimensionality and sequential data. To address these issues, we propose the SSM with multi-head self-attention and token enhancement (MHSSMamba). This model integrates spectral and spatial information by enhancing spectral tokens and using multi-head attention to capture complex relationships between spectral bands and spatial locations. It also manages long-range dependencies and the sequential nature of HSI data, preserving contextual information across spectral bands. MHSSMamba achieved remarkable classification accuracies of 97.62\% on Pavia University, 96.92\% on the University of Houston, 96.85\% on Salinas, and 99.49\% on Wuhan-longKou datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[MambaST: A Plug-and-Play Cross-Spectral Spatial-Temporal Fuser for Efficient Pedestrian Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01037v1)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes MambaST, a plug-and-play cross-spectral spatial-temporal fusion pipeline for efficient pedestrian detection. Several challenges exist for pedestrian detection in autonomous driving applications. First, it is difficult to perform accurate detection using RGB cameras under dark or low-light conditions. Cross-spectral systems must be developed to integrate complementary information from multiple sensor modalities, such as thermal and visible cameras, to improve the robustness of the detections. Second, pedestrian detection models are latency-sensitive. Efficient and easy-to-scale detection models with fewer parameters are highly desirable for real-time applications such as autonomous driving. Third, pedestrian video data provides spatial-temporal correlations of pedestrian movement. It is beneficial to incorporate temporal as well as spatial information to enhance pedestrian detection. This work leverages recent advances in the state space model (Mamba) and proposes a novel Multi-head Hierarchical Patching and Aggregation (MHHPA) structure to extract both fine-grained and coarse-grained information from both RGB and thermal imagery. Experimental results show that the proposed MHHPA is an effective and efficient alternative to a Transformer model for cross-spectral pedestrian detection. Our proposed model also achieves superior performance on small-scale pedestrian detection.

| **[Hybrid Spatial-spectral Neural Network for Hyperspectral Image Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08782v2)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is an essential procedure for HSI applications. Unfortunately, the existing Transformer-based methods mainly focus on non-local modeling, neglecting the importance of locality in image denoising. Moreover, deep learning methods employ complex spectral learning mechanisms, thus introducing large computation costs. To address these problems, we propose a hybrid spatial-spectral denoising network (HSSD), in which we design a novel hybrid dual-path network inspired by CNN and Transformer characteristics, leading to capturing both local and non-local spatial details while suppressing noise efficiently. Furthermore, to reduce computational complexity, we adopt a simple but effective decoupling strategy that disentangles the learning of space and spectral channels, where multilayer perception with few parameters is utilized to learn the global correlations among spectra. The synthetic and real experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on spatial and spectral reconstruction. The code and details are available on https://github.com/HLImg/HSSD.</p></details> | <details><summary>There...</summary><p>There are some errors in professional theory</p></details> |
| **[Distance-Preserving Generative Modeling of Spatial Transcriptomics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00911v1)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial transcriptomics data is invaluable for understanding the spatial organization of gene expression in tissues. There have been consistent efforts in studying how to effectively utilize the associated spatial information for refining gene expression modeling. We introduce a class of distance-preserving generative models for spatial transcriptomics, which utilizes the provided spatial information to regularize the learned representation space of gene expressions to have a similar pair-wise distance structure. This helps the latent space to capture meaningful encodings of genes in spatial proximity. We carry out theoretical analysis over a tractable loss function for this purpose and formalize the overall learning objective as a regularized evidence lower bound. Our framework grants compatibility with any variational-inference-based generative models for gene expression modeling. Empirically, we validate our proposed method on the mouse brain tissues Visium dataset and observe improved performance with variational autoencoders and scVI used as backbone models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empowering Snapshot Compressive Imaging: Spatial-Spectral State Space Model with Across-Scanning and Local Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00629v1)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) relies on decoding algorithms such as CNN or Transformer to reconstruct the hyperspectral image (HSI) from its compressed measurement. Although existing CNN and Transformer-based methods have proven effective, CNNs are limited by their inadequate modeling of long-range dependencies, while Transformer ones face high computational costs due to quadratic complexity. Recent Mamba models have demonstrated superior performance over CNN and Transformer-based architectures in some visual tasks, but these models have not fully utilized the local similarities in both spatial and spectral dimensions. Moreover, the long-sequence modeling capability of SSM may offer an advantage in processing the numerous spectral bands for HSI reconstruction, which has not yet been explored. In this paper, we introduce a State Space Model with Across-Scanning and Local Enhancement, named ASLE-SSM, that employs a Spatial-Spectral SSM for global-local balanced context encoding and cross-channel interaction promoting. Specifically, we introduce local scanning in the spatial dimension to balance the global and local receptive fields, and then propose our across-scanning method based on spatial-spectral local cubes to leverage local similarities between adjacent spectral bands and pixels to guide the reconstruction process. These two scanning mechanisms extract the HSI's local features while balancing the global perspective without any additional costs. Experimental results illustrate ASLE-SSM's superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods, with an inference speed 2.4 times faster than Transformer-based MST and saving 0.12 (M) of parameters, achieving the lowest computational cost and parameter count.</p></details> | 12 pages,6 figures |

However, current models rely on likelihood-based loss functions to properly model the precipitation distribution, leading to spatially inconsistent projections when sampling. This work explores a novel approach by fusing the strengths of likelihood-based and adversarial losses used in generative models. As a result, we propose a likelihood-based generative approach for precipitation downscaling, leveraging the benefits of both methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2024 Machine Learning for Earth System Modeling workshop</p></details> |
| **[Spatial Weather, Socio-Economic and Political Risks in Probabilistic Load Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00507v1)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate forecasts of the impact of spatial weather and pan-European socio-economic and political risks on hourly electricity demand for the mid-term horizon are crucial for strategic decision-making amidst the inherent uncertainty. Most importantly, these forecasts are essential for the operational management of power plants, ensuring supply security and grid stability, and in guiding energy trading and investment decisions. The primary challenge for this forecasting task lies in disentangling the multifaceted drivers of load, which include national deterministic (daily, weekly, annual, and holiday patterns) and national stochastic weather and autoregressive effects. Additionally, transnational stochastic socio-economic and political effects add further complexity, in particular, due to their non-stationarity. To address this challenge, we present an interpretable probabilistic mid-term forecasting model for the hourly load that captures, besides all deterministic effects, the various uncertainties in load. This model recognizes transnational dependencies across 24 European countries, with multivariate modeled socio-economic and political states and cross-country dependent forecasting. Built from interpretable Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), the model enables an analysis of the transmission of each incorporated effect to the hour-specific load. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of countries reliant on electric heating under extreme weather scenarios. This emphasizes the need for high-resolution forecasting of weather effects on pan-European electricity consumption especially in anticipation of widespread electric heating adoption.</p></details> |  |
| **[What makes for good morphology representations for spatial omics?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20660v2)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial omics has transformed our understanding of tissue architecture by preserving spatial context of gene expression patterns. Simultaneously, advances in imaging AI have enabled extraction of morphological features describing the tissue. The intersection of spatial omics and imaging AI presents opportunities for a more holistic understanding. In this review we introduce a framework for categorizing spatial omics-morphology combination methods, focusing on how morphological features can be translated or integrated into spatial omics analyses. By translation we mean finding morphological features that spatially correlate with gene expression patterns with the purpose of predicting gene expression. Such features can be used to generate super-resolution gene expression maps or infer genetic information from clinical H&E-stained samples. By integration we mean finding morphological features that spatially complement gene expression patterns with the purpose of enriching information. Such features can be used to define spatial domains, especially where gene expression has preceded morphological changes and where morphology remains after gene expression. We discuss learning strategies and directions for further development of the field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectral-Spatial Mamba for Hyperspectral Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18401v3)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, deep learning models have achieved excellent performance in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. Among the many deep models, Transformer has gradually attracted interest for its excellence in modeling the long-range dependencies of spatial-spectral features in HSI. However, Transformer has the problem of quadratic computational complexity due to the self-attention mechanism, which is heavier than other models and thus has limited adoption in HSI processing. Fortunately, the recently emerging state space model-based Mamba shows great computational efficiency while achieving the modeling power of Transformers. Therefore, in this paper, we make a preliminary attempt to apply the Mamba to HSI classification, leading to the proposed spectral-spatial Mamba (SS-Mamba). Specifically, the proposed SS-Mamba mainly consists of spectral-spatial token generation module and several stacked spectral-spatial Mamba blocks. Firstly, the token generation module converts any given HSI cube to spatial and spectral tokens as sequences. And then these tokens are sent to stacked spectral-spatial mamba blocks (SS-MB). Each SS-MB block consists of two basic mamba blocks and a spectral-spatial feature enhancement module. The spatial and spectral tokens are processed separately by the two basic mamba blocks, respectively. Besides, the feature enhancement module modulates spatial and spectral tokens using HSI sample's center region information. In this way, the spectral and spatial tokens cooperate with each other and achieve information fusion within each block. The experimental results conducted on widely used HSI datasets reveal that the proposed model achieves competitive results compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The Mamba-based method opens a new window for HSI classification.</p></details> | 23 pages |

| **[Statistical Inferences and Predictions for Areal Data and Spatial Data Fusion with Hausdorff--Gaussian Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07900v2)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate modeling of spatial dependence is pivotal in analyzing spatial data, influencing parameter estimation and out-of-sample predictions. The spatial structure and geometry of the data significantly impact valid statistical inference. Existing models for areal data often rely on adjacency matrices, struggling to differentiate between polygons of varying sizes and shapes. Conversely, data fusion models, while effective, rely on computationally intensive numerical integrals, presenting challenges for moderately large datasets. In response to these issues, we propose the Hausdorff-Gaussian process (HGP), a versatile model class utilizing the Hausdorff distance to capture spatial dependence in both point and areal data. We introduce a valid correlation function within the HGP framework, accommodating diverse modeling techniques, including geostatistical and areal models. Integration into generalized linear mixed-effects models enhances its applicability, particularly in addressing change of support and data fusion challenges. We validate our approach through a comprehensive simulation study and application to two real-world scenarios: one involving areal data and another demonstrating its effectiveness in data fusion. The results suggest that the HGP is competitive with specialized models regarding goodness-of-fit and prediction performances. In summary, the HGP offers a flexible and robust solution for modeling spatial data of various types and shapes, with potential applications spanning fields such as public health and climate science.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using spatial extreme-value theory with machine learning to model and understand spatially compounding weather extremes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12195v3)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When extreme weather events affect large areas, their regional to sub-continental spatial scale is important for their impacts. We propose a novel machine learning (ML) framework that integrates spatial extreme-value theory to model weather extremes and to quantify probabilities associated with the occurrence, intensity, and spatial extent of these events. Our approach employs new loss functions adapted to extreme values, enabling our model to prioritize the tail rather than the bulk of the data distribution. Applied to a case study of Western European summertime heat extremes, we use daily 500-hPa geopotential height fields and local soil moisture as predictors to capture the complex interplay between local and remote physical processes. Our generative model reveals the importance of individual circulation features in determining different facets of heat extremes, thereby enriching our process understanding from a data-driven perspective. The occurrence, intensity, and spatial extent of heat extremes are sensitive to the relative position of upper-level ridges and troughs that are part of a large-scale wave pattern. Our approach is able to extrapolate beyond the range of the data to make risk-related probabilistic statements. It applies more generally to other weather extremes and offers an attractive alternative to traditional physical and ML-based techniques that focus less on the extremal aspects of weather data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Transformer Network YOLO Model for Agricultural Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21652v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection plays a crucial role in the field of computer vision by autonomously identifying and locating objects of interest. The You Only Look Once (YOLO) model is an effective single-shot detector. However, YOLO faces challenges in cluttered or partially occluded scenes and can struggle with small, low-contrast objects. We propose a new method that integrates spatial transformer networks (STNs) into YOLO to improve performance. The proposed STN-YOLO aims to enhance the model's effectiveness by focusing on important areas of the image and improving the spatial invariance of the model before the detection process. Our proposed method improved object detection performance both qualitatively and quantitatively. We explore the impact of different localization networks within the STN module as well as the robustness of the model across different spatial transformations. We apply the STN-YOLO on benchmark datasets for Agricultural object detection as well as a new dataset from a state-of-the-art plant phenotyping greenhouse facility.

| **[Grid-Based Decompositions for Spatial Data under Local Differential Privacy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21624v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Local differential privacy (LDP) has recently emerged as a popular privacy standard. With the growing popularity of LDP, several recent works have applied LDP to spatial data, and grid-based decompositions have been a common building block in the collection and analysis of spatial data under DP and LDP. In this paper, we study three grid-based decomposition methods for spatial data under LDP: Uniform Grid (UG), PrivAG, and AAG. UG is a static approach that consists of equal-sized cells. To enable data-dependent decomposition, PrivAG was proposed by Yang et al. as the most recent adaptive grid method. To advance the state-of-the-art in adaptive grids, in this paper we propose the Advanced Adaptive Grid (AAG) method. For each grid cell, following the intuition that the cell's intra-cell density distribution will be affected by its neighbors, AAG performs uneven cell divisions depending on the neighboring cells' densities. We experimentally compare UG, PrivAG, and AAG using three real-world location datasets, varying privacy budgets, and query sizes. Results show that AAG provides higher utility than PrivAG, demonstrating the superiority of our proposed approach. Furthermore, UG's performance is heavily dependent on the choice of grid size. When the grid size is chosen optimally in UG, AAG still beats UG for small queries, but UG beats AAG for large (coarse-grained) queries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Skeleton-Based Action Recognition with Spatial-Structural Graph Convolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21525v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a field of study that focuses on identifying and classifying human activities. Skeleton-based Human Activity Recognition has received much attention in recent years, where Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based method is widely used and has achieved remarkable results. However, the representation of skeleton data and the issue of over-smoothing in GCN still need to be studied. 1). Compared to central nodes, edge nodes can only aggregate limited neighbor information, and different edge nodes of the human body are always structurally related. However, the information from edge nodes is crucial for fine-grained activity recognition. 2). The Graph Convolutional Network suffers from a significant over-smoothing issue, causing nodes to become increasingly similar as the number of network layers increases. Based on these two ideas, we propose a two-stream graph convolution method called Spatial-Structural GCN (SpSt-GCN). Spatial GCN performs information aggregation based on the topological structure of the human body, and structural GCN performs differentiation based on the similarity of edge node sequences. The spatial connection is fixed, and the human skeleton naturally maintains this topology regardless of the actions performed by humans. However, the structural connection is dynamic and depends on the type of movement the human body is performing. Based on this idea, we also propose an entirely data-driven structural connection, which greatly increases flexibility. We evaluate our method on two large-scale datasets, i.e., NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120. The proposed method achieves good results while being efficient.</p></details> |  |

To address this pressing need, we introduce GeoText-1652, a new natural language-guided geo-localization benchmark. This dataset is systematically constructed through an interactive human-computer process leveraging Large Language Model (LLM) driven annotation techniques in conjunction with pre-trained vision models. GeoText-1652 extends the established University-1652 image dataset with spatial-aware text annotations, thereby establishing one-to-one correspondences between image, text, and bounding box elements. We further introduce a new optimization objective to leverage fine-grained spatial associations, called blending spatial matching, for region-level spatial relation matching. Extensive experiments reveal that our approach maintains a competitive recall rate comparing other prevailing cross-modality methods. This underscores the promising potential of our approach in elevating drone control and navigation through the seamless integration of natural language commands in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024</p></details> |

Egocentric spatial images and videos are emerging as a compelling form of stereoscopic XR content. Different from traditional 2D images, egocentric spatial images present challenges for perceptual quality assessment due to their special shooting, processing methods, and stereoscopic characteristics. However, the corresponding image quality assessment (IQA) research for egocentric spatial images is still lacking. In this paper, we establish the Egocentric Spatial Images Quality Assessment Database (ESIQAD), the first IQA database dedicated for egocentric spatial images as far as we know. Our ESIQAD includes 500 egocentric spatial images, containing 400 images captured with the Apple Vision Pro and 100 images generated via an iPhone's "Spatial Camera" app. The corresponding mean opinion scores (MOSs) are collected under three viewing modes, including 2D display, 3D-window display, and 3D-immersive display. Furthermore, based on our database, we conduct a benchmark experiment and evaluate the performance of 22 state-of-the-art IQA models under three different viewing modes. We hope this research can facilitate future IQA research on egocentric spatial images. The database is available at https://github.com/IntMeGroup/ESIQA.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |
| **[STUPD: A Synthetic Dataset for Spatial and Temporal Relation Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06680v2)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding relations between objects is crucial for understanding the semantics of a visual scene. It is also an essential step in order to bridge visual and language models. However, current state-of-the-art computer vision models still lack the ability to perform spatial reasoning well. Existing datasets mostly cover a relatively small number of spatial relations, all of which are static relations that do not intrinsically involve motion. In this paper, we propose the Spatial and Temporal Understanding of Prepositions Dataset (STUPD) -- a large-scale video dataset for understanding static and dynamic spatial relationships derived from prepositions of the English language. The dataset contains 150K visual depictions (videos and images), consisting of 30 distinct spatial prepositional senses, in the form of object interaction simulations generated synthetically using Unity3D. In addition to spatial relations, we also propose 50K visual depictions across 10 temporal relations, consisting of videos depicting event/time-point interactions. To our knowledge, no dataset exists that represents temporal relations through visual settings. In this dataset, we also provide 3D information about object interactions such as frame-wise coordinates, and descriptions of the objects used. The goal of this synthetic dataset is to help models perform better in visual relationship detection in real-world settings. We demonstrate an increase in the performance of various models over 2 real-world datasets (ImageNet-VidVRD and Spatial Senses) when pretrained on the STUPD dataset, in comparison to other pretraining datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, it is significantly limited by high costs and sparse spatial resolution. An alternative, more cost-effective strategy is to use deep learning methods to predict high-density gene expression profiles from histological images. However, existing methods struggle to capture rich image features effectively or rely on low-dimensional positional coordinates, making it difficult to accurately predict high-resolution gene expression profiles. To address these limitations, we developed HisToSGE, a method that employs a Pathology Image Large Model (PILM) to extract rich image features from histological images and utilizes a feature learning module to robustly generate high-resolution gene expression profiles. We evaluated HisToSGE on four ST datasets, comparing its performance with five state-of-the-art baseline methods. The results demonstrate that HisToSGE excels in generating high-resolution gene expression profiles and performing downstream tasks such as spatial domain identification. All code and public datasets used in this paper are available at https://github.com/wenwenmin/HisToSGE and https://zenodo.org/records/12792163.</p></details> |  |

Despite this, the application of SNNs in graph representation learning, particularly for non-Euclidean data, remains underexplored, and the influence of spiking dynamics on graph learning is not yet fully understood. This work seeks to address these gaps by examining the unique properties and benefits of spiking dynamics in enhancing graph representation learning. We propose a spike-based graph neural network model that incorporates spiking dynamics, enhanced by a novel spatial-temporal feature normalization (STFN) technique, to improve training efficiency and model stability. Our detailed analysis explores the impact of rate coding and temporal coding on SNN performance, offering new insights into their advantages for deep graph networks and addressing challenges such as the oversmoothing problem. Experimental results demonstrate that our SNN models can achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art graph neural networks (GNNs) while considerably reducing computational costs, highlighting the potential of SNNs for efficient neuromorphic computing applications in complex graph-based scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two-stage Estimators for Spatial Confounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09358v2)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Public health data are often spatially dependent, but standard spatial regression methods can suffer from bias and invalid inference when the independent variable is associated with spatially-correlated residuals. This could occur if, for example, there is an unmeasured environmental contaminant associated with the independent and outcome variables in a spatial regression analysis. Geoadditive structural equation modeling (gSEM), in which an estimated spatial trend is removed from both the explanatory and response variables before estimating the parameters of interest, has previously been proposed as a solution, but there has been little investigation of gSEM's properties with point-referenced data. We link gSEM to results on double machine learning and semiparametric regression based on two-stage procedures. We propose using these semiparametric estimators for spatial regression using Gaussian processes with Mat\`ern covariance to estimate the spatial trends, and term this class of estimators Double Spatial Regression (DSR). We derive regularity conditions for root-$n$ asymptotic normality and consistency and closed-form variance estimation, and show that in simulations where standard spatial regression estimators are highly biased and have poor coverage, DSR can mitigate bias more effectively than competitors and obtain nominal coverage.</p></details> |  |

This capability is crucial for mobile robots to have reliable navigation, build accurate maps, and have precise behaviors around human collaborators. This paper focuses on the development of robust short-term relocalization capabilities for mobile robots using a monocular camera system. A novel multimodal keyframe descriptor is introduced, that contains semantic information of objects detected in the environment and the spatial information of the camera. Using this descriptor, a new Keyframe-based Place Recognition (KPR) method is proposed that is formulated as a multi-stage keyframe filtering algorithm, leading to a new relocalization pipeline for MKVSLAM systems. The proposed approach is evaluated over several indoor GPS denied datasets and demonstrates accurate pose recovery, in comparison to a bag-of-words approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, Keywords: VSLAM, Localization, Semantics.

| **[Skeleton-based Group Activity Recognition via Spatial-Temporal Panoramic Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19497v1)** | 2024-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group Activity Recognition aims to understand collective activities from videos. Existing solutions primarily rely on the RGB modality, which encounters challenges such as background variations, occlusions, motion blurs, and significant computational overhead. Meanwhile, current keypoint-based methods offer a lightweight and informative representation of human motions but necessitate accurate individual annotations and specialized interaction reasoning modules. To address these limitations, we design a panoramic graph that incorporates multi-person skeletons and objects to encapsulate group activity, offering an effective alternative to RGB video. This panoramic graph enables Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to unify intra-person, inter-person, and person-object interactive modeling through spatial-temporal graph convolutions. In practice, we develop a novel pipeline that extracts skeleton coordinates using pose estimation and tracking algorithms and employ Multi-person Panoramic GCN (MP-GCN) to predict group activities. Extensive experiments on Volleyball and NBA datasets demonstrate that the MP-GCN achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and efficiency. Notably, our method outperforms RGB-based approaches by using only estimated 2D keypoints as input. Code is available at https://github.com/mgiant/MP-GCN</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy-Protected Spatial Autoregressive Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16773v2)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial autoregressive (SAR) models are important tools for studying network effects. However, with an increasing emphasis on data privacy, data providers often implement privacy protection measures that make classical SAR models inapplicable. In this study, we introduce a privacy-protected SAR model with noise-added response and covariates to meet privacy-protection requirements. However, in this scenario, the traditional quasi-maximum likelihood estimator becomes infeasible because the likelihood function cannot be directly formulated. To address this issue, we first consider an explicit expression for the likelihood function with only noise-added responses. Then, we develop techniques to correct the biases for derivatives introduced by noise. Correspondingly, a Newton-Raphson-type algorithm is proposed to obtain the estimator, leading to a corrected likelihood estimator. To further enhance computational efficiency, we introduce a corrected least squares estimator based on the idea of bias correction. These two estimation methods ensure both data security and the attainment of statistically valid estimators. Theoretical analysis of both estimators is carefully conducted, statistical inference methods and model extensions are discussed. The finite sample performances of different methods are demonstrated through extensive simulations and the analysis of a real dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing Spatial Disparities: A Bayesian Linear Regression Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19171v1)** | 2024-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Epidemiological investigations of regionally aggregated spatial data often involve detecting spatial health disparities between neighboring regions on a map of disease mortality or incidence rates. Analyzing such data introduces spatial dependence among the health outcomes and seeks to report statistically significant spatial disparities by delineating boundaries that separate neighboring regions with widely disparate health outcomes. However, current statistical methods are often inadequate for appropriately defining what constitutes a spatial disparity and for constructing rankings of posterior probabilities that are robust under changes to such a definition. More specifically, non-parametric Bayesian approaches endow spatial effects with discrete probability distributions using Dirichlet processes, or generalizations thereof, and rely upon computationally intensive methods for inferring on weakly identified parameters. In this manuscript, we introduce a Bayesian linear regression framework to detect spatial health disparities. This enables us to exploit Bayesian conjugate posterior distributions in a more accessible manner and accelerate computation significantly over existing Bayesian non-parametric approaches. Simulation experiments conducted over a county map of the entire United States demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and we apply our method to a data set from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) on age-standardized US county-level estimates of mortality rates across tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer.</p></details> | 54 pages, 8 figures |

Unlike existing techniques that take multiple manual steps to derive standardized skeleton representations as model input, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Mesh Transformer (STMT) to directly model the mesh sequences. The model uses a hierarchical transformer with intra-frame off-set attention and inter-frame self-attention. The attention mechanism allows the model to freely attend between any two vertex patches to learn non-local relationships in the spatial-temporal domain. Masked vertex modeling and future frame prediction are used as two self-supervised tasks to fully activate the bi-directional and auto-regressive attention in our hierarchical transformer. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to skeleton-based and point-cloud-based models on common MoCap benchmarks.

| **[Spatial Temporal Approach for High-Resolution Gridded Wind Forecasting across Southwest Western Australia](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20283v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate wind speed and direction forecasting is paramount across many sectors, spanning agriculture, renewable energy generation, and bushfire management. However, conventional forecasting models encounter significant challenges in precisely predicting wind conditions at high spatial resolutions for individual locations or small geographical areas (< 20 km2) and capturing medium to long-range temporal trends and comprehensive spatio-temporal patterns. This study focuses on a spatial temporal approach for high-resolution gridded wind forecasting at the height of 3 and 10 metres across large areas of the Southwest of Western Australia to overcome these challenges. The model utilises the data that covers a broad geographic area and harnesses a diverse array of meteorological factors, including terrain characteristics, air pressure, 10-metre wind forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, and limited observation data from sparsely distributed weather stations (such as 3-metre wind profiles, humidity, and temperature), the model demonstrates promising advancements in wind forecasting accuracy and reliability across the entire region of interest. This paper shows the potential of our machine learning model for wind forecasts across various prediction horizons and spatial coverage. It can help facilitate more informed decision-making and enhance resilience across critical sectors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reliable Spatial-Temporal Voxels For Multi-Modal Test-Time Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06461v3)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal test-time adaptation (MM-TTA) is proposed to adapt models to an unlabeled target domain by leveraging the complementary multi-modal inputs in an online manner. Previous MM-TTA methods for 3D segmentation rely on predictions of cross-modal information in each input frame, while they ignore the fact that predictions of geometric neighborhoods within consecutive frames are highly correlated, leading to unstable predictions across time. To fulfill this gap, we propose ReLiable Spatial-temporal Voxels (Latte), an MM-TTA method that leverages reliable cross-modal spatial-temporal correspondences for multi-modal 3D segmentation. Motivated by the fact that reliable predictions should be consistent with their spatial-temporal correspondences, Latte aggregates consecutive frames in a slide window manner and constructs Spatial-Temopral (ST) voxels to capture temporally local prediction consistency for each modality. After filtering out ST voxels with high ST entropy, Latte conducts cross-modal learning for each point and pixel by attending to those with reliable and consistent predictions among both spatial and temporal neighborhoods. Experimental results show that Latte achieves state-of-the-art performance on three different MM-TTA benchmarks compared to previous MM-TTA or TTA methods.

Effectively extracting meaningful representations for user-generated check-in sequences is pivotal for facilitating various downstream services. However, the user-generated check-in data are simultaneously influenced by the surrounding objective circumstances and the user's subjective intention. Specifically, the temporal uncertainty and spatial diversity exhibited in check-in data make it difficult to capture the macroscopic spatial-temporal patterns of users and to understand the semantics of user mobility activities. Furthermore, the distinct characteristics of the temporal and spatial information in check-in sequences call for an effective fusion method to incorporate these two types of information. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Cross-view Contrastive Representation (STCCR) framework for check-in sequence representation learning. Specifically, STCCR addresses the above challenges by employing self-supervision from "spatial topic" and "temporal intention" views, facilitating effective fusion of spatial and temporal information at the semantic level. Besides, STCCR leverages contrastive clustering to uncover users' shared spatial topics from diverse mobility activities, while employing angular momentum contrast to mitigate the impact of temporal uncertainty and noise. We extensively evaluate STCCR on three real-world datasets and demonstrate its superior performance across three downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted as a regular paper at IEEE TKDE</p></details> |

Current MIL models predominantly rely on instance-level features derived from pretrained models such as ResNet. These models segment each WSI into independent patches and extract features from these local patches, leading to a significant loss of global spatial context and restricting the model's focus to merely local features. To address this issue, we propose a novel MIL framework, named SAM-MIL, that emphasizes spatial contextual awareness and explicitly incorporates spatial context by extracting comprehensive, image-level information. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents a pioneering visual segmentation foundational model that can capture segmentation features without the need for additional fine-tuning, rendering it an outstanding tool for extracting spatial context directly from raw WSIs. Our approach includes the design of group feature extraction based on spatial context and a SAM-Guided Group Masking strategy to mitigate class imbalance issues. We implement a dynamic mask ratio for different segmentation categories and supplement these with representative group features of categories. Moreover, SAM-MIL divides instances to generate additional pseudo-bags, thereby augmenting the training set, and introduces consistency of spatial context across pseudo-bags to further enhance the model's performance. Experimental results on the CAMELYON-16 and TCGA Lung Cancer datasets demonstrate that our proposed SAM-MIL model outperforms existing mainstream methods in WSIs classification.

In this method, extreme values are down-weighted because of their lower likelihood values, which yields robust estimates. In this work, we study the properties of the ML$q$E for spatial data with replicates. We investigate the asymptotic properties of the ML$q$E for Gaussian random fields with a Mat\'ern covariance function, and carry out simulation studies to investigate the numerical performance of the ML$q$E. We show that it can provide more robust and stable estimation results when some of the replicates in the spatial data contain outliers. In addition, we develop a mechanism to find the optimal choice of the hyper-parameter $q$ for the ML$q$E. The robustness of our approach is further verified on a United States precipitation dataset. Compared with other robust methods for spatial data, our proposal is more intuitive and easier to understand, yet it performs well when dealing with datasets containing outliers.</p></details> |  |

It captures photons at each pixel independently, creating binary spike streams rich in temporal information but challenging for image reconstruction. Current algorithms, both traditional and deep learning-based, still need to be improved in the utilization of the rich temporal detail and the restoration of the details of the reconstructed image. To overcome this, we introduce Swin Spikeformer (SwinSF), a novel model for dynamic scene reconstruction from spike streams. SwinSF is composed of Spike Feature Extraction, Spatial-Temporal Feature Extraction, and Final Reconstruction Module. It combines shifted window self-attention and proposed temporal spike attention, ensuring a comprehensive feature extraction that encapsulates both spatial and temporal dynamics, leading to a more robust and accurate reconstruction of spike streams. Furthermore, we build a new synthesized dataset for spike image reconstruction which matches the resolution of the latest spike camera, ensuring its relevance and applicability to the latest developments in spike camera imaging. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network SwinSF sets a new benchmark, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a series of datasets, including both real-world and synthesized data across various resolutions. Our codes and proposed dataset will be available soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[SRFNet: Monocular Depth Estimation with Fine-grained Structure via Spatial Reliability-oriented Fusion of Frames and Events](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12842v2)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular depth estimation is a crucial task to measure distance relative to a camera, which is important for applications, such as robot navigation and self-driving. Traditional frame-based methods suffer from performance drops due to the limited dynamic range and motion blur. Therefore, recent works leverage novel event cameras to complement or guide the frame modality via frame-event feature fusion. However, event streams exhibit spatial sparsity, leaving some areas unperceived, especially in regions with marginal light changes. Therefore, direct fusion methods, e.g., RAMNet, often ignore the contribution of the most confident regions of each modality. This leads to structural ambiguity in the modality fusion process, thus degrading the depth estimation performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatial Reliability-oriented Fusion Network (SRFNet), that can estimate depth with fine-grained structure at both daytime and nighttime. Our method consists of two key technical components. Firstly, we propose an attention-based interactive fusion (AIF) module that applies spatial priors of events and frames as the initial masks and learns the consensus regions to guide the inter-modal feature fusion. The fused feature are then fed back to enhance the frame and event feature learning. Meanwhile, it utilizes an output head to generate a fused mask, which is iteratively updated for learning consensual spatial priors. Secondly, we propose the Reliability-oriented Depth Refinement (RDR) module to estimate dense depth with the fine-grained structure based on the fused features and masks. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on the synthetic and real-world datasets, which shows that, even without pretraining, our method outperforms the prior methods, e.g., RAMNet, especially in night scenes.

The proposed EFA is a novel global context modeling mechanism that focuses on functioning the global non-linearity, not the specific roles of the query, key and value. For the decoder, we explore the optimized structure for considering the globality, which can improve the semantic segmentation performance. In addition, we propose a novel Inference Spatial Reduction (ISR) method for the computational efficiency. Different from the previous spatial reduction attention methods, our ISR method further reduces the key-value resolution at the inference phase, which can mitigate the computation-performance trade-off gap for the efficient semantic segmentation. Our EDAFormer shows the state-of-the-art performance with the efficient computation compared to the existing transformer-based semantic segmentation models in three public benchmarks, including ADE20K, Cityscapes and COCO-Stuff.

| **[Exploring Covid-19 Spatiotemporal Dynamics: Non-Euclidean Spatially Aware Functional Registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17132v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When it came to Covid-19, timing was everything. This paper considers the spatiotemporal dynamics of the Covid-19 pandemic via a developed methodology of non-Euclidean spatially aware functional registration. In particular, the daily SARS-CoV-2 incidence in each of 380 local authorities in the UK from March to June 2020 is analysed to understand the phase variation of the waves when considered as curves. This is achieved by adapting a traditional registration method (that of local variation analysis) to account for the clear spatial dependencies in the data. This adapted methodology is shown via simulation studies to perform substantially better for the estimation of the registration functions than the non-spatial alternative. Moreover, it is found that the driving time between locations represents the spatial dependency in the Covid-19 data better than geographical distance. However, since driving time is non-Euclidean, the traditional spatial frameworks break down; to solve this, a methodology inspired by multidimensional scaling is developed to approximate the driving times by a Euclidean distance which enables the established theory to be applied. Finally, the resulting estimates of the registration/warping processes are analysed by taking functionals to understand the qualitatively observable earliness/lateness and sharpness/flatness of the Covid-19 waves quantitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 13 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Graph Transformer with Correlated Spatial-Temporal Positional Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16959v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning effective representations for Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs (CTDGs) has garnered significant research interest, largely due to its powerful capabilities in modeling complex interactions between nodes. A fundamental and crucial requirement for representation learning in CTDGs is the appropriate estimation and preservation of proximity. However, due to the sparse and evolving characteristics of CTDGs, the spatial-temporal properties inherent in high-order proximity remain largely unexplored. Despite its importance, this property presents significant challenges due to the computationally intensive nature of personalized interaction intensity estimation and the dynamic attributes of CTDGs. To this end, we propose a novel Correlated Spatial-Temporal Positional encoding that incorporates a parameter-free personalized interaction intensity estimation under the weak assumption of the Poisson Point Process. Building on this, we introduce the Dynamic Graph Transformer with \Correlated Spatial-Temporal Positional Encoding (CorDGT), which efficiently retains the evolving spatial-temporal high-order proximity for effective node representation learning in CTDGs. Extensive experiments on seven small and two large-scale datasets demonstrate the superior performance and scalability of the proposed CorDGT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing the Information Theoretical Roots of Spatial Dependence Measures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18459v2)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intuitively, there is a relation between measures of spatial dependence and information theoretical measures of entropy. For instance, we can provide an intuition of why spatial data is special by stating that, on average, spatial data samples contain less than expected information. Similarly, spatial data, e.g., remotely sensed imagery, that is easy to compress is also likely to show significant spatial autocorrelation. Formulating our (highly specific) core concepts of spatial information theory in the widely used language of information theory opens new perspectives on their differences and similarities and also fosters cross-disciplinary collaboration, e.g., with the broader AI/ML communities. Interestingly, however, this intuitive relation is challenging to formalize and generalize, leading prior work to rely mostly on experimental results, e.g., for describing landscape patterns. In this work, we will explore the information theoretical roots of spatial autocorrelation, more specifically Moran's I, through the lens of self-information (also known as surprisal) and provide both formal proofs and experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>COSIT...</summary><p>COSIT-2024 Conference Proceedings</p></details> |

Previous studies mainly explore large-scale hotspots by visual analysis or simple indexes, where hotspots usually cover the entire central business district, train stations, or dense residential areas, reaching a radius of hundreds or even thousands of meters. However, the spatial arrangement patterns of small-scale hotspots, reflecting the specific popular pick-up and drop-off locations, have not received much attention. This study quantitatively examines the spatial arrangement of fine-grained local hotspots in Wuhan and Beijing, China, using taxi trajectory data. Hotspots are adaptatively identified with sizes of 90m*90m in Wuhan and 105m*105m in Beijing according to identification method. Findings show popular hotspots are typically surrounded by less popular ones, though regions with many popular hotspots inhibit the presence of less popular ones. We term these configurations as hierarchical accompany and inhibiting patterns. Finally, inspired by both patterns, a KNN-based model is developed to describe these relationships, successfully reproducing the spatial distribution of less popular hotspots based on the most popular ones. These insights enhance understanding of local urban structures and support urban planning.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce the novel task of Open-domain Urban Itinerary Planning (OUIP), which generates personalized urban itineraries from user requests in natural language. We then present ITINERA, an OUIP system that integrates spatial optimization with large language models to provide customized urban itineraries based on user needs. This involves decomposing user requests, selecting candidate points of interest (POIs), ordering the POIs based on cluster-aware spatial optimization, and generating the itinerary. Experiments on real-world datasets and the performance of the deployed system demonstrate our system's capacity to deliver personalized and spatially coherent itineraries compared to current solutions.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, Coordinated Spatial Reuse (C-SR) can potentially contribute to optimizing spectrum resource utilization. This mechanism is expected to enable a higher number of simultaneous transmissions, thereby boosting spectral efficiency in dense environments and increasing the overall network performance. In this paper, we focus on the performance analysis of C-SR in Wi-Fi 8 networks. In particular, we consider an implementation of C-SR where channel access and inter-Access Point (AP) communication are performed over-the-air using the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF). For such a purpose, we leverage the well-known Bianchi's throughput model and extend it to support multi-AP transmissions via C-SR. Numerical results in a WLAN network that consists of four APs show C-SR throughput gains ranging from 54% to 280% depending on the inter-AP distance and the position of the stations in the area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mobius: A High Efficient Spatial-Temporal Parallel Training Paradigm for Text-to-Video Generation Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06617v4)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the success of the text-to-image (T2I) generation task, many researchers are devoting themselves to the text-to-video (T2V) generation task. Most of the T2V frameworks usually inherit from the T2I model and add extra-temporal layers of training to generate dynamic videos, which can be viewed as a fine-tuning task. However, the traditional 3D-Unet is a serial mode and the temporal layers follow the spatial layers, which will result in high GPU memory and training time consumption according to its serial feature flow. We believe that this serial mode will bring more training costs with the large diffusion model and massive datasets, which are not environmentally friendly and not suitable for the development of the T2V. Therefore, we propose a highly efficient spatial-temporal parallel training paradigm for T2V tasks, named Mobius. In our 3D-Unet, the temporal layers and spatial layers are parallel, which optimizes the feature flow and backpropagation. The Mobius will save 24% GPU memory and 12% training time, which can greatly improve the T2V fine-tuning task and provide a novel insight for the AIGC community. We will release our codes in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Transformer Captures Spatial-Temporal Dependencies: A Theory for Gaussian Process Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16134v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformer, the backbone of Sora for video generation, successfully scales the capacity of diffusion models, pioneering new avenues for high-fidelity sequential data generation. Unlike static data such as images, sequential data consists of consecutive data frames indexed by time, exhibiting rich spatial and temporal dependencies. These dependencies represent the underlying dynamic model and are critical to validate the generated data. In this paper, we make the first theoretical step towards bridging diffusion transformers for capturing spatial-temporal dependencies. Specifically, we establish score approximation and distribution estimation guarantees of diffusion transformers for learning Gaussian process data with covariance functions of various decay patterns. We highlight how the spatial-temporal dependencies are captured and affect learning efficiency. Our study proposes a novel transformer approximation theory, where the transformer acts to unroll an algorithm. We support our theoretical results by numerical experiments, providing strong evidence that spatial-temporal dependencies are captured within attention layers, aligning with our approximation theory.</p></details> | 52 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Bayes-Optimal Estimation in Generalized Linear Models via Spatial Coupling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08404v2)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of signal estimation in a generalized linear model (GLM). GLMs include many canonical problems in statistical estimation, such as linear regression, phase retrieval, and 1-bit compressed sensing. Recent work has precisely characterized the asymptotic minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) for GLMs with i.i.d. Gaussian sensing matrices. However, in many models there is a significant gap between the MMSE and the performance of the best known feasible estimators. In this work, we address this issue by considering GLMs defined via spatially coupled sensing matrices. We propose an efficient approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for estimation and prove that with a simple choice of spatially coupled design, the MSE of a carefully tuned AMP estimator approaches the asymptotic MMSE in the high-dimensional limit. To prove the result, we first rigorously characterize the asymptotic performance of AMP for a GLM with a generic spatially coupled design. This characterization is in terms of a deterministic recursion (`state evolution') that depends on the parameters defining the spatial coupling. Then, using a simple spatially coupled design and a judicious choice of functions for the AMP algorithm, we analyze the fixed points of the resulting state evolution and show that it achieves the asymptotic MMSE. Numerical results for phase retrieval and rectified linear regression show that spatially coupled designs can yield substantially lower MSE than i.i.d. Gaussian designs at finite dimensions when used with AMP algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 4 figures.

Video Streaming Analysis (VSA), one of the most interesting tasks of TinyML, consists in scanning a sequence of frames in a streaming manner, with the goal of identifying interesting patterns. Given the strict constraints of these tiny devices, all the current solutions rely on performing a frame-by-frame analysis, hence not exploiting the temporal component in the stream of data. In this paper, we present StreamTinyNet, the first TinyML architecture to perform multiple-frame VSA, enabling a variety of use cases that requires spatial-temporal analysis that were previously impossible to be carried out at a TinyML level. Experimental results on public-available datasets show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution. Finally, StreamTinyNet has been ported and tested on the Arduino Nicla Vision, showing the feasibility of what proposed.</p></details> | <details><summary>this ...</summary><p>this paper has been accepted and presented at the WCCI24 conference</p></details> |

The central aim of multi-agent optimization is for a network of agents to collaboratively solve a system-level optimization problem with local objective functions and node-to-node communication by distributed algorithms. The scalability of such algorithms crucially depends on the complexity of the communication messages, and a number of communication compressors for distributed optimization have recently been proposed in the literature. First of all, we introduce a general spatio-temporal compressor characterized by the stability of the resulting dynamical system along the vector field of the compressor. We show that several important distributed optimization compressors such as the greedy sparsifier, the uniform quantizer, and the scalarizer all fall into the category of this spatio-temporal compressor. Next, we propose two distributed prime-dual flows with the spatio-temporal compressors being applied to local node states and local error states, respectively, and prove (exponential) convergence of the node trajectories to the global optimizer for (strongly) convex cost functions. Finally, a few numerical examples are present to illustrate our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |

Most existing studies show satisfying performance under regular scenarios, but most neglected safety-critical scenarios. In this study, a spatio-temporal dual-encoder network named STDA for safety-critical scenarios was developed. Considering the exceptional capabilities of human drivers in terms of situational awareness and comprehending risks, driver attention was incorporated into STDA to facilitate swift identification of the critical regions, which is expected to improve both performance and interpretability. STDA contains four parts: the driver attention prediction module, which predicts driver attention; the fusion module designed to fuse the features between driver attention and raw images; the temporary encoder module used to enhance the capability to interpret dynamic scenes; and the behavior prediction module to predict the behavior. The experiment data are used to train and validate the model. The results show that STDA improves the G-mean from 0.659 to 0.719 when incorporating driver attention and adopting a temporal encoder module. In addition, extensive experimentation has been conducted to validate that the proposed module exhibits robust generalization capabilities and can be seamlessly integrated into other mainstream models.</p></details> |  |

This study, part of the European LAMASUS (Land Management for Sustainability) project, aims to support the EU's climate neutrality target by developing a governance model through collaboration between policymakers, land users, and researchers. We present a methodological synthesis for treating land use data using a Bayesian approach within spatial and spatio-temporal modeling frameworks. The study tackles the challenges of analyzing land use changes, particularly the presence of zero values and computational issues with large datasets. It introduces joint model structures to address zeros and employs sequential inference and consensus methods for Big Data problems. Spatial downscaling models approximate smaller scales from aggregated data, circumventing high-resolution data complications. We explore Beta regression and Compositional Data Analysis (CoDa) for land use data, review relevant spatial and spatio-temporal models, and present strategies for handling zeros. The paper demonstrates the implementation of key models, downscaling techniques, and solutions to Big Data challenges with examples from simulated data and the LAMASUS project, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding and managing land use changes.</p></details> | 29 pages, 6 figures |

However, their predictive distribution is not generally known. Under this modeling assumption, we define a novel spatio-temporal embedding and a theory-guided machine learning approach that employs a generalized Bayesian algorithm to make ensemble forecasts. We use Lipschitz predictors and determine fixed-time and any-time PAC Bayesian bounds in the batch learning setting. Performing causal forecast is a highlight of our methodology as its potential application to data with spatial and temporal short and long-range dependence. We then test the performance of our learning methodology by using linear predictors and data sets simulated from a spatio-temporal Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</p></details> |  |
| **[SARN: Structurally-Aware Recurrent Network for Spatio-Temporal Disaggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07292v4)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open data is frequently released spatially aggregated, usually to comply with privacy policies. But coarse, heterogeneous aggregations complicate learning and integration for downstream AI/ML systems. In this work, we consider models to disaggregate spatio-temporal data from a low-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., census tract) to a high-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., city block). We propose an overarching model named the Structurally-Aware Recurrent Network (SARN), which integrates structurally-aware spatial attention (SASA) layers into the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model. The spatial attention layers capture spatial interactions among regions, while the gated recurrent module captures the temporal dependencies. Each SASA layer calculates both global and structural attention -- global attention facilitates comprehensive interactions between different geographic levels, while structural attention leverages the containment relationship between different geographic levels (e.g., a city block being wholly contained within a census tract) to ensure coherent and consistent results. For scenarios with limited historical training data, we explore transfer learning and show that a model pre-trained on one city variable can be fine-tuned for another city variable using only a few hundred samples. Evaluating these techniques on two mobility datasets, we find that on both datasets, SARN significantly outperforms other neural models (5% and 1%) and typical heuristic methods (40% and 14%), enabling us to generate realistic, high-quality fine-grained data for downstream applications.</p></details> |  |

Different from conventional approaches that statically estimate fetal brain motions from pairs of images, our method dynamically tracks the rigid movement patterns of the fetal head across temporal and spatial dimensions. Specifically, we first develop an equivariant neural network that efficiently learns rigid motion sequences through low-dimensional spatial representations of images. Subsequently, we learn spatio-temporal representations by incorporating time encoding and self-attention neural network layers. This approach allows for the capture of long-term dependencies of fetal brain motion and addresses alignment errors due to contrast changes and severe motion artifacts. Our model also provides a geometric deformation estimation that properly addresses image distortions among all time frames. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to learn spatial-temporal representations via deep neural networks for fetal motion tracking without data augmentation. We validated our model using real fetal echo-planar images with simulated and real motions. Our method carries significant potential value in accurately measuring, tracking, and correcting fetal motion in fetal MRI sequences.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions (MICCAI) Workshop on Perinatal Imaging, Placental and Preterm Image analysis (PIPPI) 2024</p></details> |
| **[STANet: A Novel Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network for Depression Classification with Small and Unbalanced FMRI Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21323v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate diagnosis of depression is crucial for timely implementation of optimal treatments, preventing complications and reducing the risk of suicide. Traditional methods rely on self-report questionnaires and clinical assessment, lacking objective biomarkers. Combining fMRI with artificial intelligence can enhance depression diagnosis by integrating neuroimaging indicators. However, the specificity of fMRI acquisition for depression often results in unbalanced and small datasets, challenging the sensitivity and accuracy of classification models. In this study, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network (STANet) for diagnosing depression by integrating CNN and RNN to capture both temporal and spatial features of brain activity. STANet comprises the following steps:(1) Aggregate spatio-temporal information via ICA. (2) Utilize multi-scale deep convolution to capture detailed features. (3) Balance data using the SMOTE to generate new samples for minority classes. (4) Employ the AFGRU classifier, which combines Fourier transformation with GRU, to capture long-term dependencies, with an adaptive weight assignment mechanism to enhance model generalization. The experimental results demonstrate that STANet achieves superior depression diagnostic performance with 82.38% accuracy and a 90.72% AUC. The STFA module enhances classification by capturing deeper features at multiple scales. The AFGRU classifier, with adaptive weights and stacked GRU, attains higher accuracy and AUC. SMOTE outperforms other oversampling methods. Additionally, spatio-temporal aggregated features achieve better performance compared to using only temporal or spatial features. STANet outperforms traditional or deep learning classifiers, and functional connectivity-based classifiers, as demonstrated by ten-fold cross-validation.</p></details> |  |

These programs are being increasingly asked to provide forest parameter estimates for spatial and temporal extents smaller than their current design and accompanying design-based methods can deliver with desired levels of uncertainty. Many NFI designs and estimation methods focus on status and are not well equipped to provide acceptable estimates for trend and change parameters, especially over small spatial domains and/or short time periods. Fine-scale space-time indexed estimates are critical to a variety of environmental, ecological, and economic monitoring efforts. Estimates for forest carbon status, trend, and change are of particular importance to international initiatives to track carbon dynamics. Model-based small area estimation (SAE) methods for NFI and similar ecological monitoring data typically pursue inference on status within small spatial domains, with few demonstrated methods that account for spatio-temporal dependence needed for trend and change estimation. We propose a spatio-temporal Bayesian model framework that delivers statistically valid estimates with full uncertainty quantification for status, trend, and change. The framework accommodates a variety of space and time dependency structures, and we detail model configurations for different settings. Through analysis of simulated datasets, we compare the relative performance of candidate models and a traditional direct estimator. We then apply candidate models to a large-scale NFI dataset to demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework for providing unique quantification of forest carbon dynamics in the contiguous United States. We also provide computationally efficient algorithms, software, and data to reproduce our results and for benchmarking.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpotFormer: Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Transformer for Facial Expression Spotting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20799v1)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial expression spotting, identifying periods where facial expressions occur in a video, is a significant yet challenging task in facial expression analysis. The issues of irrelevant facial movements and the challenge of detecting subtle motions in micro-expressions remain unresolved, hindering accurate expression spotting. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for facial expression spotting. First, we propose a Sliding Window-based Multi-Resolution Optical flow (SW-MRO) feature, which calculates multi-resolution optical flow of the input image sequence within compact sliding windows. The window length is tailored to perceive complete micro-expressions and distinguish between general macro- and micro-expressions. SW-MRO can effectively reveal subtle motions while avoiding severe head movement problems. Second, we propose SpotFormer, a multi-scale spatio-temporal Transformer that simultaneously encodes spatio-temporal relationships of the SW-MRO features for accurate frame-level probability estimation. In SpotFormer, our proposed Facial Local Graph Pooling (FLGP) and convolutional layers are applied for multi-scale spatio-temporal feature extraction. We show the validity of the architecture of SpotFormer by comparing it with several model variants. Third, we introduce supervised contrastive learning into SpotFormer to enhance the discriminability between different types of expressions. Extensive experiments on SAMM-LV and CAS(ME)^2 show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models, particularly in micro-expression spotting.</p></details> |  |

Recently, machine learning has emerged as an appealing alternative to improve accuracy and reduce computational time. However, due to limited observational technology and high costs, the scarcity of real-world data restricts the potential of machine learning models. To overcome these limitations, we propose an ocean SWH estimation framework, namely Orca. Specifically, Orca enhances the limited spatio-temporal reasoning abilities of classic LLMs with a novel spatiotemporal aware encoding module. By segmenting the limited buoy observational data temporally, encoding the buoys' locations spatially, and designing prompt templates, Orca capitalizes on the robust generalization ability of LLMs to estimate significant wave height effectively with limited data. Experimental results on the Gulf of Mexico demonstrate that Orca achieves state-of-the-art performance in SWH estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Deepsets for Off-policy Evaluation under Spatial or Spatio-temporal Interferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17910v1)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is widely applied in sectors such as pharmaceuticals and e-commerce to evaluate the efficacy of novel products or policies from offline datasets. This paper introduces a causal deepset framework that relaxes several key structural assumptions, primarily the mean-field assumption, prevalent in existing OPE methodologies that handle spatio-temporal interference. These traditional assumptions frequently prove inadequate in real-world settings, thereby restricting the capability of current OPE methods to effectively address complex interference effects. In response, we advocate for the implementation of the permutation invariance (PI) assumption. This innovative approach enables the data-driven, adaptive learning of the mean-field function, offering a more flexible estimation method beyond conventional averaging. Furthermore, we present novel algorithms that incorporate the PI assumption into OPE and thoroughly examine their theoretical foundations. Our numerical analyses demonstrate that this novel approach yields significantly more precise estimations than existing baseline algorithms, thereby substantially improving the practical applicability and effectiveness of OPE methodologies. A Python implementation of our proposed method is available at https://github.com/BIG-S2/Causal-Deepsets.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOAP: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Relation and Motion Information Capturing for Few-Shot Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16344v2)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High frame-rate (HFR) videos of action recognition improve fine-grained expression while reducing the spatio-temporal relation and motion information density. Thus, large amounts of video samples are continuously required for traditional data-driven training. However, samples are not always sufficient in real-world scenarios, promoting few-shot action recognition (FSAR) research. We observe that most recent FSAR works build spatio-temporal relation of video samples via temporal alignment after spatial feature extraction, cutting apart spatial and temporal features within samples. They also capture motion information via narrow perspectives between adjacent frames without considering density, leading to insufficient motion information capturing. Therefore, we propose a novel plug-and-play architecture for FSAR called Spatio-tempOral frAme tuPle enhancer (SOAP) in this paper. The model we designed with such architecture refers to SOAP-Net. Temporal connections between different feature channels and spatio-temporal relation of features are considered instead of simple feature extraction. Comprehensive motion information is also captured, using frame tuples with multiple frames containing more motion information than adjacent frames. Combining frame tuples of diverse frame counts further provides a broader perspective. SOAP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance across well-known benchmarks such as SthSthV2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51. Extensive empirical evaluations underscore the competitiveness, pluggability, generalization, and robustness of SOAP.

Existing methods either utilize multi-modal information in video-text pairs or apply global and local alignment techniques to promote alignment precision. However, these methods often fail to fully explore the spatio-temporal relationships among vision tokens within video and across different video-text pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer module to uniformly learn spatial and temporal contexts for video-language alignment pre-training (dubbed STGT). Specifically, our STGT combines spatio-temporal graph structure information with attention in transformer block, effectively utilizing the spatio-temporal contexts. In this way, we can model the relationships between vision tokens, promoting video-text alignment precision for benefiting downstream tasks. In addition, we propose a self-similarity alignment loss to explore the inherent self-similarity in the video and text. With the initial optimization achieved by contrastive learning, it can further promote the alignment accuracy between video and text. Experimental results on challenging downstream tasks, including video-text retrieval and video question answering, verify the superior performance of our method.</p></details> | under review |

Current state-of-the-art methods either require multiple independent stages of processing that employ motion cues or, in the case of end-to-end trainable networks, lack in segmentation accuracy, in part due to the difficulty of learning segmentation maps from videos with transient object presence. This limits the application of WSVOS for semantic annotation of surgical videos where multiple surgical tools frequently move in and out of the field of view, a problem that is more difficult than typically encountered in WSVOS. This paper introduces Video Spatio-Temporal Disentanglement Networks (VDST-Net), a framework to disentangle spatiotemporal information using semi-decoupled knowledge distillation to predict high-quality class activation maps (CAMs). A teacher network designed to resolve temporal conflicts when specifics about object location and timing in the video are not provided works with a student network that integrates information over time by leveraging temporal dependencies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on a public reference dataset and on a more challenging surgical video dataset where objects are, on average, present in less than 60\% of annotated frames. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and generates superior segmentation masks under video-level weak supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

The knowledge tree enables the visualization of hierarchical interrelation within the STKG, while the knowledge net elucidates semantic relationships among knowledge entities. Additionally, the knowledge map displays spatial and temporal distributions via spatial maps and time axes, respectively. Our visualization technology addresses the limitations inherent in single-view approaches and the deficiency of interaction in spatio-temporal perspectives evident in existing visualization methods.

| **[Towards Effective Fusion and Forecasting of Multimodal Spatio-temporal Data for Smart Mobility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16123v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of location based services, multimodal spatio-temporal (ST) data including trajectories, transportation modes, traffic flow and social check-ins are being collected for deep learning based methods. These deep learning based methods learn ST correlations to support the downstream tasks in the fields such as smart mobility, smart city and other intelligent transportation systems. Despite their effectiveness, ST data fusion and forecasting methods face practical challenges in real-world scenarios. First, forecasting performance for ST data-insufficient area is inferior, making it necessary to transfer meta knowledge from heterogeneous area to enhance the sparse representations. Second, it is nontrivial to accurately forecast in multi-transportation-mode scenarios due to the fine-grained ST features of similar transportation modes, making it necessary to distinguish and measure the ST correlations to alleviate the influence caused by entangled ST features. At last, partial data modalities (e.g., transportation mode) are lost due to privacy or technical issues in certain scenarios, making it necessary to effectively fuse the multimodal sparse ST features and enrich the ST representations. To tackle these challenges, our research work aim to develop effective fusion and forecasting methods for multimodal ST data in smart mobility scenario. In this paper, we will introduce our recent works that investigates the challenges in terms of various real-world applications and establish the open challenges in this field for future work.</p></details> | 4 pages |

Although Bayesian methods are common in spatio-temporal modeling, standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques are usually slow for large datasets such as house price data. To tackle this problem, we propose a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal modeling approach. This method involves partitioning the data into multiple subsets and applying an appropriate Gaussian process model to each subset in parallel. The results from each subset are then combined using the Wasserstein barycenter technique to obtain the global parameters for the original problem. The proposed methodology allows for multiple observations per spatial and time unit, thereby offering added benefits for practitioners. As a real-life application, we analyze house price data of more than 0.6 million transactions from 983 middle layer super output areas in London over a period of eight years. The methodology provides insightful findings about the effects of various amenities, trend patterns, and the relationship between prices and carbon emissions. Furthermore, as demonstrated through a cross-validation study, it shows good predictive accuracy while balancing computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary material is available from the authors upon request</p></details> |
| **[The SPDE approach for spatio-temporal datasets with advection and diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14015v4)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the task of predicting spatio-temporal fields in environmental science using statistical methods, introducing statistical models inspired by the physics of the underlying phenomena that are numerically efficient is of growing interest. Large space-time datasets call for new numerical methods to efficiently process them. The Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) approach has proven to be effective for the estimation and the prediction in a spatial context. We present here the advection-diffusion SPDE with first order derivative in time which defines a large class of nonseparable spatio-temporal models. A Gaussian Markov random field approximation of the solution to the SPDE is built by discretizing the temporal derivative with a finite difference method (implicit Euler) and by solving the spatial SPDE with a finite element method (continuous Galerkin) at each time step. The ''Streamline Diffusion'' stabilization technique is introduced when the advection term dominates the diffusion. Computationally efficient methods are proposed to estimate the parameters of the SPDE and to predict the spatio-temporal field by kriging, as well as to perform conditional simulations. The approach is applied to a solar radiation dataset. Its advantages and limitations are discussed.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Approach with Self-Corrective Causal Inference for Flight Delay Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15185v1)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate flight delay prediction is crucial for the secure and effective operation of the air traffic system. Recent advances in modeling inter-airport relationships present a promising approach for investigating flight delay prediction from the multi-airport scenario. However, the previous prediction works only accounted for the simplistic relationships such as traffic flow or geographical distance, overlooking the intricate interactions among airports and thus proving inadequate. In this paper, we leverage causal inference to precisely model inter-airport relationships and propose a self-corrective spatio-temporal graph neural network (named CausalNet) for flight delay prediction. Specifically, Granger causality inference coupled with a self-correction module is designed to construct causality graphs among airports and dynamically modify them based on the current airport's delays. Additionally, the features of the causality graphs are adaptively extracted and utilized to address the heterogeneity of airports. Extensive experiments are conducted on the real data of top-74 busiest airports in China. The results show that CausalNet is superior to baselines. Ablation studies emphasize the power of the proposed self-correction causality graph and the graph feature extraction module. All of these prove the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Source and Test-Time Domain Adaptation on Multivariate Signals using Spatio-Temporal Monge Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14303v1)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning applications on signals such as computer vision or biomedical data often face significant challenges due to the variability that exists across hardware devices or session recordings. This variability poses a Domain Adaptation (DA) problem, as training and testing data distributions often differ. In this work, we propose Spatio-Temporal Monge Alignment (STMA) to mitigate these variabilities. This Optimal Transport (OT) based method adapts the cross-power spectrum density (cross-PSD) of multivariate signals by mapping them to the Wasserstein barycenter of source domains (multi-source DA). Predictions for new domains can be done with a filtering without the need for retraining a model with source data (test-time DA). We also study and discuss two special cases of the method, Temporal Monge Alignment (TMA) and Spatial Monge Alignment (SMA). Non-asymptotic concentration bounds are derived for the mappings estimation, which reveals a bias-plus-variance error structure with a variance decay rate of $\mathcal{O}(n_\ell^{-1/2})$ with $n_\ell$ the signal length. This theoretical guarantee demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed computational schema. Numerical experiments on multivariate biosignals and image data show that STMA leads to significant and consistent performance gains between datasets acquired with very different settings. Notably, STMA is a pre-processing step complementary to state-of-the-art deep learning methods.</p></details> |  |

Owing to the outstanding performance in dealing with structure learning potentials, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are often used to capture such complex spatio-temporal features in multivariate time series. However, these data-driven models often fail to capture the essential spatio-temporal relationships when significant signal corruption occurs. Additionally, calculating the high-order neighbor nodes in these models is of high computational complexity. To address these problems, we propose a novel higher-order spatio-temporal physics-incorporated GNN (HSPGNN). Firstly, the dynamic Laplacian matrix can be obtained by the spatial attention mechanism. Then, the generic inhomogeneous partial differential equation (PDE) of physical dynamic systems is used to construct the dynamic higher-order spatio-temporal GNN to obtain the missing time series values. Moreover, we estimate the missing impact by Normalizing Flows (NF) to evaluate the importance of each node in the graph for better explainability. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HSPGNN and the superior performance when combining various order neighbor nodes. Also, graph-like optical flow, dynamic graphs, and missing impact can be obtained naturally by HSPGNN, which provides better dynamic analysis and explanation than traditional data-driven models.

Traditional methods rely on hand-crafted features and machine learning techniques, which often struggle to model the complex dynamics of human motion. Recent deep learning-based methods have achieved success by learning spatio-temporal representations of motion, but these models often overlook the reliability of motion data. Additionally, the temporal and spatial dependencies of skeleton nodes are distinct. The temporal relationship captures motion information over time, while the spatial relationship describes body structure and the relationships between different nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal branching network using incremental information for HMP, which decouples the learning of temporal-domain and spatial-domain features, extracts more motion information, and achieves complementary cross-domain knowledge learning through knowledge distillation. Our approach effectively reduces noise interference and provides more expressive information for characterizing motion by separately extracting temporal and spatial features. We evaluate our approach on standard HMP benchmarks and outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>The i...</summary><p>The incremental information of our paper includes the displacement information from the last frame of the historical sequence, derived from the motion information of the first frame in the future sequence and the motion information of the last frame of the historical sequence.

Changes in the size, shape and movement of the chambers can be important markers for cardiac disease and modeling this in relation to clinical demography or disease is therefore of interest. Existing methods for spatio-temporal modeling of the human heart require shape correspondence over time or suffer from large memory requirements, making it difficult to use for complex anatomies. We introduce a novel conditional generative model, where the shape and movement is modeled implicitly in the form of a spatio-temporal neural distance field and conditioned on clinical demography. The model is based on an auto-decoder architecture and aims to disentangle the individual variations from that related to the clinical demography. It is tested on the left atrium (including the left atrial appendage), where it outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for anatomical sequence completion and generates synthetic sequences that realistically mimics the shape and motion of the real left atrium. In practice, this means we can infer functional measurements from a static image, generate synthetic populations with specified demography or disease and investigate how non-imaging clinical data effect the shape and motion of cardiac anatomies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for MICCAI2024</p></details> |

However, estimating incidence or mortality rates associated with rare cancers presents important difficulties and poses new statistical methodological challenges. In this paper, we expand the collection of multivariate spatio-temporal models by introducing adaptable shared spatio-temporal components to enable a comprehensive analysis of both incidence and cancer mortality in rare cancer cases. These models allow the modulation of spatio-temporal effects between incidence and mortality, allowing for changes in their relationship over time. The new models have been implemented in INLA using r-generic constructions. We conduct a simulation study to evaluate the performance of the new spatio-temporal models. Our results show that multivariate spatio-temporal models incorporating a flexible shared spatio-temporal term outperform conventional multivariate spatio-temporal models that include specific spatio-temporal effects for each health outcome. We use these models to analyze incidence and mortality data for pancreatic cancer and leukaemia among males across 142 administrative health care districts of Great Britain over a span of nine biennial periods (2002-2019).</p></details> | 40 pages, 12 figures |

To address this limitation, this paper presents the spatio-temporal GraphFormer framework for 3D human pose estimation in video, which integrates body structure graph-based representations with spatio-temporal information. Specifically, we develop a spatio-temporal criss-cross graph (STG) attention mechanism. This approach is designed to learn the long-range dependencies in data across both time and space, integrating graph information directly into the respective attention layers. Furthermore, we introduce the dual-path modulated hop-wise regular GCN (MHR-GCN) module, which utilizes modulation to optimize parameter usage and employs spatio-temporal hop-wise skip connections to acquire higher-order information. Additionally, this module processes temporal and spatial dimensions independently to learn their respective features while avoiding mutual influence. Finally, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D human pose estimation on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets.</p></details> |  |

The restoration and enhancement have proven to be highly beneficial. However, there are only a limited number of enhancement methods explicitly designed for videos acquired in low-light conditions. We propose a Spatio-Temporal Aligned SUNet (STA-SUNet) model using a Swin Transformer as a backbone to capture low light video features and exploit their spatio-temporal correlations. The STA-SUNet model is trained on a novel, fully registered dataset (BVI), which comprises dynamic scenes captured under varying light conditions. It is further analysed comparatively against various other models over three test datasets. The model demonstrates superior adaptivity across all datasets, obtaining the highest PSNR and SSIM values. It is particularly effective in extreme low-light conditions, yielding fairly good visualisation results.</p></details> |  |

In this regard, covariance properties with respect to geometric image transformations in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy are essential for expressing robust image operations, and for formulating invariant visual operations at higher levels. This paper defines and proves a set of joint covariance properties for spatio-temporal receptive fields in terms of spatio-temporal derivative operators applied to spatio-temporally smoothed image data under compositions of spatial scaling transformations, spatial affine transformations, Galilean transformations and temporal scaling transformations. Specifically, the derived relations show how the parameters of the receptive fields need to be transformed, in order to match the output from spatio-temporal receptive fields under composed spatio-temporal image transformations. For this purpose, we also fundamentally extend the notion of scale-normalized derivatives to affine-normalized derivatives, that are computed based on spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels, and analyze the covariance properties of the resulting affine-normalized derivatives for the affine group as well as for important subgroups thereof. We conclude with a geometric analysis, showing how the derived joint covariance properties make it possible to relate or match spatio-temporal receptive field responses, when observing, possibly moving, local surface patches from different views, under locally linearized perspective or projective transformations, as well as when observing different instances of spatio-temporal events, that may occur either faster or slower between different views of similar spatio-temporal events.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 13 figures.

Designing spatio-temporal forecasting models separately in a task-wise and city-wise manner to forecast demand and supply-demand gap in a ride-hailing system poses a burden for the expanding transportation network companies. Therefore, a multi-task learning architecture is proposed in this study by developing gated ensemble of spatio-temporal mixture of experts network (GESME-Net) with convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and recurrent neural network (RNN) for simultaneously forecasting these spatio-temporal tasks in a city as well as across different cities. Furthermore, a task adaptation layer is integrated with the architecture for learning joint representation in multi-task learning and revealing the contribution of the input features utilized in prediction. The proposed architecture is tested with data from Didi Chuxing for: (i) simultaneously forecasting demand and supply-demand gap in Beijing, and (ii) simultaneously forecasting demand across Chengdu and Xian. In both scenarios, models from our proposed architecture outperformed the single-task and multi-task deep learning benchmarks and ensemble-based machine learning algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2012.08868</p></details> |

If an AV can predict its surrounding vehicles' future trajectories, it can make safe and efficient manoeuvre decisions. In this paper, we present such a Deep Spatio-Temporal Context-Aware decision Network (DST-CAN) model for predictive manoeuvre planning of AVs. A memory neuron network is used to predict future trajectories of its surrounding vehicles. The driving environment's spatio-temporal information (past, present, and predicted future trajectories) are embedded into a context-aware grid. The proposed DST-CAN model employs these context-aware grids as inputs to a convolutional neural network to understand the spatial relationships between the vehicles and determine a safe and efficient manoeuvre decision. The DST-CAN model also uses information of human driving behavior on a highway. Performance evaluation of DST-CAN has been carried out using two publicly available NGSIM US-101 and I-80 datasets. Also, rule-based ground truth decisions have been compared with those generated by DST-CAN. The results clearly show that DST-CAN can make much better decisions with 3-sec of predicted trajectories of neighboring vehicles compared to currently existing methods that do not use this prediction.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

Traditional methods based on generative adversarial networks(GAN) or joint learning frameworks can achieve good prediction accuracy under low observation ratios, but they usually have high computational costs. In view of this, this paper proposes a spatio-temporal encoding and decoding-based method for future human activity skeleton synthesis. Firstly, algorithms such as time control, discrete cosine transform, and low-pass filtering are used to cut or pad the skeleton sequences. Secondly, the encoder and decoder are responsible for extracting intermediate semantic encoding from observed skeleton sequences and inferring future sequences from the intermediate semantic encoding, respectively. Finally, joint displacement error, velocity error, and acceleration error, three higher-order kinematic features, are used as key components of the loss function to optimize model parameters. Experimental results show that the proposed future skeleton synthesis algorithm performs better than some existing algorithms. It generates skeleton sequences with smaller errors and fewer model parameters, effectively providing future information for early activity prediction.</p></details> |  |

We train this model on the Raw Heidelberg Digits keyword spotting benchmark using Backpropagation Through Time with surrogate gradients. Analysing the spatio-temporal structure of synaptic interactions in the network we observe that after training excitation and inhibition are grouped together both in space and time. To further enhance the efficiency and biological realism of our model, we implemented a dynamic pruning strategy that combines DEEP R for connection removal and RigL for connection reintroduction, ensuring that the network maintains optimal connectivity throughout training. Additionally, we incorporated Dale's Principle, enforcing each neuron to be exclusively excitatory or inhibitory -- aligning our model closer to biological neural networks. We observed that, after training, the spatio-temporal patterns of excitation and inhibition appeared in the more biologically plausible model as well. Our research demonstrates the potential of integrating learnable delays, dynamic pruning, and biological constraints to develop efficient SNN models for temporal data processing. Furthermore, our results enhance the understanding of spatio-temporal dynamics in SNNs -- suggesting that the spatio-temporal features which emerge from training are robust to both pruning and rewiring processes -- providing a solid foundation for future work in neuromorphic computing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, submitted to Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience</p></details> |

To address these problems, this study proposes a spatio-temporal model that incorporates skewness while maintaining mean and variance, by applying the flexible subclass of the closed skew-normal distribution. An efficient sampling method is introduced, leveraging the autoregressive representation of the model. Additionally, the model's symmetry concerning spatial order is demonstrated, and Mardia's skewness and kurtosis are derived, showing independence from the mean and variance. Simulation studies compare the estimation performance of the proposed model with that of the Gaussian model. The result confirms its superiority in high skewness and low observation noise scenarios. The identification of Cobb-Douglas production functions across US states is examined as an application to real data, revealing that the proposed model excels in both goodness-of-fit and predictive performance.</p></details> |  |

Most of the existing models achieve either spectral or spatial compression, and do not jointly consider the spatio-spectral redundancies present in HSIs. To address this problem, in this paper we focus our attention on the High Fidelity Compression (HiFiC) model (which is proven to be highly effective for spatial compression problems) and adapt it to perform spatio-spectral compression of HSIs. In detail, we introduce two new models: i) HiFiC using Squeeze and Excitation (SE) blocks (denoted as HiFiC$_{SE}$); and ii) HiFiC with 3D convolutions (denoted as HiFiC$_{3D}$) in the framework of compression of HSIs. We analyze the effectiveness of HiFiC$_{SE}$ and HiFiC$_{3D}$ in compressing the spatio-spectral redundancies with channel attention and inter-dependency analysis. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed models in performing spatio-spectral compression, while reconstructing images at reduced bitrates with higher reconstruction quality. The code of the proposed models is publicly available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/HSI-SSC .</p></details> |  |

Multicasting has garnered consistent attention as a means to fulfill the increasing demand for more efficient data transmission methods. Nevertheless, leveraging multicast wireless networks for spatio-temporally asynchronous data requests poses challenges. In this context, this paper introduces a new multicast mechanism called \emph{set-up based merged multicast (SMMC)} to minimize the delivery time of the requested file in wireless networks by considering the uncertainties inherent in wireless channels. The proposed mechanism comprises two phases. The first phase involves gathering asynchronous requests for a file from users experiencing diverse channel conditions. During this phase, packets of the requested file are transmitted individually in unicast mode within a specified set-up time. Following this, the second phase initiates multicast transmission, which sequentially handles the remaining packets of the file in multicast mode. In the proposed mechanism, we optimize the set-up time and transmission rates of both unicast and multicast modes to minimize the expected file delivery time by jointly taking into account the statistical characteristics of wireless channels, users' locations, and file popularity. Additionally, we also delve into a \emph{fine-tuned SMMC} by utilizing posterior information on the multicast group size and further improve the performance. Our performance evaluations reveal that the proposed SMMC outperforms conventional unicast methods, especially with high-demand data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion Models for EEG Super-Resolution in Epilepsy Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03089v2)** | 2024-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, particularly high-density EEG (HD EEG) devices, is widely used in fields such as neuroscience. HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, meeting the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STADMs) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which then serve as conditional inputs to guide the reverse denoising process of diffusion models. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STADMs demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks of epilepsy patients, indicating their potential to significantly improve the spatial resolution of LR EEG.</p></details> |  |

In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from the stochastic processes associated with the particle labels. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over a large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the limiting dynamics of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</p></details> |  |

Many research works, including Potential Outcome Model and Structural Causal Model, have been proposed to realize it. However, their modelings, theoretical foundations and application approaches are usually different. Moreover, there is a lack of graphical approach to infer spatio-temporal counterfactuals, that considers spatial and temporal interactions between multiple units. Thus, in this work, our aim is to investigate a survey to compare and discuss different counterfactual models, theories and approaches, and further build a unified graphical causal frameworks to infer the spatio-temporal counterfactuals.</p></details> |  |

Despite remarkable breakthroughs in pretrained natural language models that enable one model to handle diverse tasks, a universal solution for spatio-temporal prediction remains challenging Existing prediction approaches are typically tailored for specific spatio-temporal scenarios, requiring task-specific model designs and extensive domain-specific training data. In this study, we introduce UniST, a universal model designed for general urban spatio-temporal prediction across a wide range of scenarios. Inspired by large language models, UniST achieves success through: (i) utilizing diverse spatio-temporal data from different scenarios, (ii) effective pre-training to capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics, (iii) knowledge-guided prompts to enhance generalization capabilities. These designs together unlock the potential of building a universal model for various scenarios Extensive experiments on more than 20 spatio-temporal scenarios demonstrate UniST's efficacy in advancing state-of-the-art performance, especially in few-shot and zero-shot prediction.

In this work, we target enhancing VLMs with a fine-grained structural spatio-temporal alignment learning method (namely Finsta). First of all, we represent the input texts and videos with fine-grained scene graph (SG) structures, both of which are further unified into a holistic SG (HSG) for bridging two modalities. Then, an SG-based framework is built, where the textual SG (TSG) is encoded with a graph Transformer, while the video dynamic SG (DSG) and the HSG are modeled with a novel recurrent graph Transformer for spatial and temporal feature propagation. A spatial-temporal Gaussian differential graph Transformer is further devised to strengthen the sense of the changes in objects across spatial and temporal dimensions. Next, based on the fine-grained structural features of TSG and DSG, we perform object-centered spatial alignment and predicate-centered temporal alignment respectively, enhancing the video-language grounding in both the spatiality and temporality. We design our method as a plug&play system, which can be integrated into existing well-trained VLMs for further representation augmentation, without training from scratch or relying on SG annotations in downstream applications. On 6 representative VL modeling tasks over 12 datasets in both standard and long-form video scenarios, Finsta consistently improves the existing 13 strong-performing VLMs persistently, and refreshes the current state-of-the-art end task performance significantly in both the fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TPAMI 2024</p></details> |

However, current works for evaluating the spatio-temporal understanding capability of LLMs are somewhat limited and biased. These works either fail to incorporate the latest language models or only focus on assessing the memorized spatio-temporal knowledge. To address this gap, this paper dissects LLMs' capability of spatio-temporal data into four distinct dimensions: knowledge comprehension, spatio-temporal reasoning, accurate computation, and downstream applications. We curate several natural language question-answer tasks for each category and build the benchmark dataset, namely STBench, containing 13 distinct tasks and over 60,000 QA pairs. Moreover, we have assessed the capabilities of 13 LLMs, such as GPT-4o, Gemma and Mistral. Experimental results reveal that existing LLMs show remarkable performance on knowledge comprehension and spatio-temporal reasoning tasks, with potential for further enhancement on other tasks through in-context learning, chain-of-though prompting, and fine-tuning. The code and datasets of STBench are released on https://github.com/LwbXc/STBench.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in foundational models, particularly those employing self-attention mechanisms, have significantly enhanced our ability to comprehend the semantics of diverse data types. One such area that could highly benefit from multi-modality is in understanding geospatial data, which inherently has multiple modalities. However, current Natural Language Processing (NLP) mechanisms struggle to effectively address geospatial queries. Existing pre-trained LLMs are inadequately equipped to meet the unique demands of geospatial data, lacking the ability to retrieve precise spatio-temporal data in real-time, thus leading to significantly reduced accuracy in answering complex geospatial queries. To address these limitations, we introduce Geode--a pioneering system designed to tackle zero-shot geospatial question-answering tasks with high precision using spatio-temporal data retrieval. Our approach represents a significant improvement in addressing the limitations of current LLM models, demonstrating remarkable improvement in geospatial question-answering abilities compared to existing state-of-the-art pre-trained models.</p></details> |  |

While a few researchers focus on learning ice layer patterns from echogram images captured by airborne snow radar sensors via different convolutional neural networks, the noise in the echogram images proves to be a major obstacle. Instead, we focus on geometric deep learning based on graph neural networks to learn the spatio-temporal patterns from thickness information of shallow ice layers and make predictions for deep layers. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed hybrid graph neural network that combines the GraphSAGE framework for graph feature learning with the long short-term memory (LSTM) structure for learning temporal changes, and introduce measurements of physical ice properties from Model Atmospheric Regional (MAR) weather model as physical node features. We found that our proposed network can consistently outperform the current non-inductive or non-physical model in predicting deep ice layer thickness.</p></details> |  |

OFOS platforms offer dynamic allocation incentives to users and merchants through diverse marketing campaigns to encourage payments while maintaining the platforms' budget efficiency. Despite significant progress, the marketing domain continues to face two primary challenges: (i) how to allocate a limited budget with greater efficiency, demanding precision in predicting users' monotonic response (i.e. sensitivity) to incentives, and (ii) ensuring spatio-temporal adaptability and robustness in diverse marketing campaigns across different times and locations. To address these issues, we propose a Constrained Monotonic Adaptive Network (CoMAN) method for spatio-temporal perception within marketing pricing. Specifically, we capture spatio-temporal preferences within attribute features through two foundational spatio-temporal perception modules. To further enhance catching the user sensitivity differentials to incentives across varied times and locations, we design modules for learning spatio-temporal convexity and concavity as well as for expressing sensitivity functions. CoMAN can achieve a more efficient allocation of incentive investments during pricing, thus increasing the conversion rate and orders while maintaining budget efficiency. Extensive offline and online experimental results within our diverse marketing campaigns demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach while outperforming the monotonic state-of-the-art method.</p></details> | 7 pages |

Matrix factorization is employed to decompose spatio-temporal data into spatial and temporal components. To improve clarity in the temporal patterns, we introduce a nonnegativity constraint on the time domain along with regularization in the frequency domain. Specifically, regularization in the frequency domain involves selecting features in the frequency space, making an interpretation in the frequency domain more convenient. We propose two methods in the frequency domain: soft and hard regularizations, and provide convergence guarantees to first-order stationary points of the corresponding constrained optimization problem. While our primary motivation stems from geophysical data analysis based on GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) data, our methodology has the potential for wider application. Consequently, when applying our methodology to GRACE data, we find that the results with the proposed methodology are comparable to previous research in the field of geophysical sciences but offer clearer interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, Final version</p></details> |

Despite their advantages, a significant gap persists between real-world scenarios, where detection speed is critical, and existing proposals, which operate on large graphs representing several hours of traffic. This gap results in unrealistic operational conditions and impractical detection delays. Moreover, existing models do not generalize well across different networks, hampering their deployment in production environments. To address these issues, we introduce PPTGNN, a practical spatio-temporal GNN for intrusion detection. PPTGNN enables near real-time predictions, while better capturing the spatio-temporal dynamics of network attacks. PPTGNN employs self-supervised pre-training for improved performance and reduced dependency on labeled data. We evaluate PPTGNN on three public datasets and show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, such as E-ResGAT and E-GraphSAGE, with an average accuracy improvement of 10.38%. Finally, we show that a pre-trained PPTGNN can easily be fine-tuned to unseen networks with minimal labeled examples. This highlights the potential of PPTGNN as a general, large-scale pre-trained model that can effectively operate in diverse network environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper currently under review.

While limiting the variety of training data can make training easier, it can also lead to a lack of knowledge and information for the model, resulting in a decrease in performance. To address this challenge, we presented an innovative paradigm that incorporates three separate forms of curriculum learning specifically targeting from spatial, temporal, and quantile perspectives. Furthermore, our framework incorporates a stacking fusion module to combine diverse information from three types of curriculum learning, resulting in a strong and thorough learning process. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this framework with extensive empirical evaluations, highlighting its better performance in addressing complex ST challenges. We provided thorough ablation studies to investigate the effectiveness of our curriculum and to explain how it contributes to the improvement of learning efficiency on ST data.</p></details> |  |

Premature predictions may yield a higher rate of false alarms, whereas delaying predictions to gather more information can render them too late to be useful. In applications such as wildfires, crimes, and traffic jams, timely forecasting are vital for safeguarding human life and property. Consequently, finding a balance between accuracy and timeliness is crucial. In this paper, we propose an early spatio-temporal forecasting model based on Multi-Objective reinforcement learning that can either implement an optimal policy given a preference or infer the preference based on a small number of samples. The model addresses two primary challenges: 1) enhancing the accuracy of early forecasting and 2) providing the optimal policy for determining the most suitable prediction time for each area. Our method demonstrates superior performance on three large-scale real-world datasets, surpassing existing methods in early spatio-temporal forecasting tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted paper in KDD 2024</p></details> |

This paper proposes a Multi-level Multi-view Augmented Spatio-temporal Transformer (LVSTformer) for traffic prediction. The model aims to capture spatial dependencies from three different levels: local geographic, global semantic, and pivotal nodes, along with long- and short-term temporal dependencies. Specifically, we design three spatial augmented views to delve into the spatial information from the perspectives of local, global, and pivotal nodes. By combining three spatial augmented views with three parallel spatial self-attention mechanisms, the model can comprehensively captures spatial dependencies at different levels. We design a gated temporal self-attention mechanism to effectively capture long- and short-term temporal dependencies. Furthermore, a spatio-temporal context broadcasting module is introduced between two spatio-temporal layers to ensure a well-distributed allocation of attention scores, alleviating overfitting and information loss, and enhancing the generalization ability and robustness of the model. A comprehensive set of experiments is conducted on six well-known traffic benchmarks, the experimental results demonstrate that LVSTformer achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to competing baselines, with the maximum improvement reaching up to 4.32%.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we focus on NCA models used for texture synthesis, where the update rule is inspired by partial differential equations (PDEs) describing reaction-diffusion systems. To train the NCA model, the spatio-temporal domain is discretized, and Euler integration is used to numerically simulate the PDE. However, whether a trained NCA truly learns the continuous dynamic described by the corresponding PDE or merely overfits the discretization used in training remains an open question. We study NCA models at the limit where space-time discretization approaches continuity. We find that existing NCA models tend to overfit the training discretization, especially in the proximity of the initial condition, also called "seed". To address this, we propose a solution that utilizes uniform noise as the initial condition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in preserving the consistency of NCA dynamics across a wide range of spatio-temporal granularities. Our improved NCA model enables two new test-time interactions by allowing continuous control over the speed of pattern formation and the scale of the synthesized patterns. We demonstrate this new NCA feature in our interactive online demo. Our work reveals that NCA models can learn continuous dynamics and opens new venues for NCA research from a dynamical system's perspective.</p></details> | 9 pages, 12 figures |

Specifically, in the context of estimation, we seek the most likely evolution realizing measured spatio-temporal marginals of killed particles. In the context of control, we seek a suitable control action directing the killed process toward spatio-temporal probabilistic constraints. To this end, we derive a new Schr\"odinger system of coupled, in space and time, partial differential equations to construct the solution of the proposed problem. Further, we show that a Fortet-Sinkhorn type of algorithm is available to attain the associated bridge. A key feature of our framework is that the obtained bridge retains the Markovian structure in the prior process, and thereby, the corresponding controller takes the form of state feedback.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |

Mainstream approaches employ bidirectional feature propagation, spatio-temporal transformers, or a combination of both to extract information from the video sequence. However, limitations in memory and computational resources constraints the temporal window length of the spatio-temporal transformer, preventing the extraction of longer temporal contextual information from the video sequence. Additionally, bidirectional feature propagation is highly sensitive to inaccurate optical flow in blurry frames, leading to error accumulation during the propagation process. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{BSSTNet}, \textbf{B}lur-aware \textbf{S}patio-temporal \textbf{S}parse \textbf{T}ransformer Network. It introduces the blur map, which converts the originally dense attention into a sparse form, enabling a more extensive utilization of information throughout the entire video sequence. Specifically, BSSTNet (1) uses a longer temporal window in the transformer, leveraging information from more distant frames to restore the blurry pixels in the current frame. (2) introduces bidirectional feature propagation guided by blur maps, which reduces error accumulation caused by the blur frame. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed BSSTNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the GoPro and DVD datasets.</p></details> | CVPR 2024 |

Spatio-temporal data, on the other hand, is vital for analyzing phenomena in both space and time, providing a dynamic perspective on complex system interactions. Recently, diffusion models have seen widespread application in time series and spatio-temporal data mining. Not only do they enhance the generative and inferential capabilities for sequential and temporal data, but they also extend to other downstream tasks. In this survey, we comprehensively and thoroughly review the use of diffusion models in time series and spatio-temporal data, categorizing them by model category, task type, data modality, and practical application domain. In detail, we categorize diffusion models into unconditioned and conditioned types and discuss time series and spatio-temporal data separately. Unconditioned models, which operate unsupervised, are subdivided into probability-based and score-based models, serving predictive and generative tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, and imputation. Conditioned models, on the other hand, utilize extra information to enhance performance and are similarly divided for both predictive and generative tasks. Our survey extensively covers their application in various fields, including healthcare, recommendation, climate, energy, audio, and transportation, providing a foundational understanding of how these models analyze and generate data.

However, significant individual variation in the organisation of the human cerebral cortex makes it difficult to identify population-level trends in these signals. Recently, Surface Vision Transformers (SiTs) have emerged as a promising approach for modelling cortical signals, yet they face some limitations in low-data scenarios due to the lack of inductive biases in their architecture. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the surface Masked AutoEncoder (sMAE) and video surface Masked AutoEncoder (vsMAE) - for multivariate and spatio-temporal pre-training of cortical signals over regular icosahedral grids. These models are trained to reconstruct cortical feature maps from masked versions of the input by learning strong latent representations of cortical structure and function. Such representations translate into better modelling of individual phenotypes and enhanced performance in downstream tasks. The proposed approach was evaluated on cortical phenotype regression using data from the young adult Human Connectome Project (HCP) and developing HCP (dHCP). Results show that (v)sMAE pre-trained models improve phenotyping prediction performance on multiple tasks by $\ge 26\%$, and offer faster convergence relative to models trained from scratch. Finally, we show that pre-training vision transformers on large datasets, such as the UK Biobank (UKB), supports transfer learning to low-data regimes. Our code and pre-trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/metrics-lab/surface-masked-autoencoders .</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publications for MIDL 2024; 20 figures; 7 figures</p></details> |

Considering the spatio-temporal nature of EEG data, one of our frameworks is based on a CNN-BiLSTM model. The other involves a CNN-Transformer architecture which inherently involves the more versatile attention based learning paradigm. In both cases, a special 1D-CNN feature extraction module is used to generate the initial embeddings with 1D convolutions in the time and the EEG channel domains. Considering the EEG signals are noisy, non stationary and the discriminative features are even less clear (than in semantically structured data such as text or image), we also follow a window-based classification followed by majority voting during inference, to yield labels at a signal level. To illustrate how brain patterns correlate with different image classes, we visualize t-SNE plots of the BiLSTM embeddings alongside brain activation maps for the top 10 classes. These visualizations provide insightful revelations into the distinct neural signatures associated with each visual category, showcasing the BiLSTM's capability to capture and represent the discriminative brain activity linked to visual stimuli. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on the updated EEG-Imagenet dataset with positive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been submitted at ICPR 2024.

However, tackling the video camouflage object detection (VCOD) task presents a unique challenge. Camouflaged objects typically blend into the background, making them difficult to distinguish in still images. Additionally, ensuring temporal consistency in this context is a challenging problem. As a result, SAM encounters limitations and falls short when applied to the VCOD task. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new method called the SAM Propagation Module (SAM-PM). Our propagation module enforces temporal consistency within SAM by employing spatio-temporal cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, we exclusively train the propagation module while keeping the SAM network weights frozen, allowing us to integrate task-specific insights with the vast knowledge accumulated by the large model. Our method effectively incorporates temporal consistency and domain-specific expertise into the segmentation network with an addition of less than 1% of SAM's parameters. Extensive experimentation reveals a substantial performance improvement in the VCOD benchmark when compared to the most recent state-of-the-art techniques. Code and pre-trained weights are open-sourced at https://github.com/SpiderNitt/SAM-PM</p></details> |  |

The prediction of the remaining useful life (RUL) of batteries is crucial for ensuring reliable and efficient operation, as well as reducing maintenance costs. However, determining the life cycle of batteries in real-world scenarios is challenging, and existing methods have limitations in predicting the number of cycles iteratively. In addition, existing works often oversimplify the datasets, neglecting important features of the batteries such as temperature, internal resistance, and material type. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a two-stage RUL prediction scheme for Lithium-ion batteries using a spatio-temporal multimodal attention network (ST-MAN). The proposed ST-MAN is to capture the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in the battery data, including the features that are often neglected in existing works. Despite operating without prior knowledge of end-of-life (EOL) events, our method consistently achieves lower error rates, boasting mean absolute error (MAE) and mean square error (MSE) of 0.0275 and 0.0014, respectively, compared to existing convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM)-based methods. The proposed method has the potential to improve the reliability and efficiency of battery operations and is applicable in various industries.</p></details> |  |

We propose novel approaches to improve mesh-agnostic spatio-temporal prediction of transient flow fields using graph U-Nets, enabling accurate prediction on diverse mesh configurations. Key enhancements to the graph U-Net architecture, including the Gaussian mixture model convolutional operator and noise injection approaches, provide increased flexibility in modeling node dynamics: the former reduces prediction error by 95\% compared to conventional convolutional operators, while the latter improves long-term prediction robustness, resulting in an error reduction of 86\%. We also investigate transductive and inductive-learning perspectives of graph U-Nets with proposed improvements. In the transductive setting, they effectively predict quantities for unseen nodes within the trained graph. In the inductive setting, they successfully perform in mesh scenarios with different vortex-shedding periods, showing 98\% improvement in predicting the future flow fields compared to a model trained without the inductive settings. It is found that graph U-Nets without pooling operations, i.e. without reducing and restoring the node dimensionality of the graph data, perform better in inductive settings due to their ability to learn from the detailed structure of each graph. Meanwhile, we also discover that the choice of normalization technique significantly impacts graph U-Net performance.</p></details> |  |

While spatio-temporal graph neural networks have made excellent progress on this problem, their non-Euclidean and discrete data structure modeling of reality limits its potential. In this work, we make the first attempt to combine two different spatio-temporal perspectives, fields and graphs, by proposing a new model, Spatio-Temporal Field Neural Network, and its corresponding new framework, Pyramidal Inference.

Although these methods have shown some potential in creating immersive experiences, two drawbacks limit their ubiquity: (i) a significant reduction in reconstruction quality when the computing budget is limited, and (ii) a lack of semantic understanding of the underlying scenes. To address these issues, we introduce Gear-NeRF, which leverages semantic information from powerful image segmentation models. Our approach presents a principled way for learning a spatio-temporal (4D) semantic embedding, based on which we introduce the concept of gears to allow for stratified modeling of dynamic regions of the scene based on the extent of their motion. Such differentiation allows us to adjust the spatio-temporal sampling resolution for each region in proportion to its motion scale, achieving more photo-realistic dynamic novel view synthesis. At the same time, almost for free, our approach enables free-viewpoint tracking of objects of interest - a functionality not yet achieved by existing NeRF-based methods. Empirical studies validate the effectiveness of our method, where we achieve state-of-the-art rendering and tracking performance on multiple challenging datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to IEEE/CVF CVPR 2024 (Spotlight).

Computations are done through a Gaussian Markov random field approximation of the solution of the SPDE, which is constructed through a finite volume method. The new flexible non-separable model is compared to a flexible separable model both for reconstruction and forecasting and evaluated in terms of root mean square errors and continuous rank probability scores. A simulation study demonstrates that the non-separable model performs better when the data is simulated with non-separable effects such as diffusion and advection. Further, we estimate surrogate models for emulating the output of a ocean model in Trondheimsfjorden, Norway, and simulate observations of autonoumous underwater vehicles. The results show that the flexible non-separable model outperforms the flexible separable model for real-time prediction of unobserved locations.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, they have gained considerable research interest. However, existing SNNs predominantly rely on the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model and are primarily suited for simple, static tasks. They lack the ability to effectively model long-term temporal dependencies and facilitate spatial information interaction, which is crucial for tackling complex, dynamic spatio-temporal prediction tasks. To tackle these challenges, this paper draws inspiration from the concept of autaptic synapses in biology and proposes a novel Spatio-Temporal Circuit (STC) model. The STC model integrates two learnable adaptive pathways, enhancing the spiking neurons' temporal memory and spatial coordination. We conduct a theoretical analysis of the dynamic parameters in the STC model, highlighting their contribution in establishing long-term memory and mitigating the issue of gradient vanishing. Through extensive experiments on multiple spatio-temporal prediction datasets, we demonstrate that our model outperforms other adaptive models. Furthermore, our model is compatible with existing spiking neuron models, thereby augmenting their dynamic representations. In essence, our work enriches the specificity and topological complexity of SNNs.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML2024 |

The existing video adversarial attack methods mainly take a gradient-based approach and generate adversarial videos with noticeable perturbations. In this paper, we propose a novel Sparse Adversarial Video Attack via Spatio-Temporal Invertible Neural Networks (SVASTIN) to generate adversarial videos through spatio-temporal feature space information exchanging. It consists of a Guided Target Video Learning (GTVL) module to balance the perturbation budget and optimization speed and a Spatio-Temporal Invertible Neural Network (STIN) module to perform spatio-temporal feature space information exchanging between a source video and the target feature tensor learned by GTVL module. Extensive experiments on UCF-101 and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our proposed SVASTIN can generate adversarial examples with higher imperceptibility than the state-of-the-art methods with the higher fooling rate.

For example, in landscape genetics, the aim is to infer spatial mechanisms that govern gene flow in populations. Existing statistical approaches in landscape genetics do not account for temporal dependence in the data and may be computationally prohibitive. We infer mechanisms with a Bayesian hierarchical dyadic model that scales well with large data sets and that accounts for spatial and temporal dependence. We construct a fully-connected network comprising spatio-temporal data for the dyadic model and use normalized composite likelihoods to account for the dependence structure in space and time. We develop a dyadic model to account for physical mechanisms commonly found in physical-statistical models and apply our methods to ancient human DNA data to infer the mechanisms that affected human movement in Bronze Age Europe.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 7 figures, 3 appendices, code on GitHub</p></details> |

Many recent studies have concentrated on meticulously reconciling various advantages, leading to designed models that are neither simple nor practical. To address this issue, this paper presents a systematic study on existing shortcomings faced by off-the-shelf models, including lack of local fidelity, poor prediction performance over long time-steps,low scalability, and inefficiency. To systematically address the aforementioned problems, we propose an EarthFarseer, a concise framework that combines parallel local convolutions and global Fourier-based transformer architectures, enabling dynamically capture the local-global spatial interactions and dependencies. EarthFarseer also incorporates a multi-scale fully convolutional and Fourier architectures to efficiently and effectively capture the temporal evolution. Our proposal demonstrates strong adaptability across various tasks and datasets, with fast convergence and better local fidelity in long time-steps predictions. Extensive experiments and visualizations over eight human society physical and natural physical datasets demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance of EarthFarseer.

Consequently, methods for predicting and preventing traffic accidents have been researched for many years. With advancements in the field of artificial intelligence, various studies have applied Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to traffic accident prediction. Modern traffic conditions change rapidly by the minute, and these changes vary significantly across different roads. In other words, the risk of traffic accidents changes minute by minute in various patterns for each road. Therefore, it is desirable to predict traffic accident risk at the Minute-Level and Road-Level. However, because roads have close and complex relationships with adjacent roads, research on predicting traffic accidents at the Minute-Level and Road-Level is challenging. Thus, it is essential to build a model that can reflect the spatial and temporal characteristics of roads for traffic accident prediction. Consequently, recent attempts have been made to use Graph Convolutional Networks to capture the spatial characteristics of roads and Recurrent Neural Networks to capture their temporal characteristics for predicting traffic accident risk. This paper proposes the Sequential based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (SST-GCN), which combines GCN and LSTM, to predict traffic accidents at the Minute-Level and Road-Level using a road dataset constructed in Seoul, the capital of South Korea. Experiments have demonstrated that SST-GCN outperforms other state-of-the-art models in Minute-Level predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19121v2)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial Message Passing Graph Neural Networks (MPGNNs) are widely used for learning on graph-structured data. However, key limitations of l-step MPGNNs are that their "receptive field" is typically limited to the l-hop neighborhood of a node and that information exchange between distant nodes is limited by over-squashing. Motivated by these limitations, we propose Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Networks (S$^2$GNNs) -- a new modeling paradigm for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that synergistically combines spatially and spectrally parametrized graph filters. Parameterizing filters partially in the frequency domain enables global yet efficient information propagation. We show that S$^2$GNNs vanquish over-squashing and yield strictly tighter approximation-theoretic error bounds than MPGNNs. Further, rethinking graph convolutions at a fundamental level unlocks new design spaces. For example, S$^2$GNNs allow for free positional encodings that make them strictly more expressive than the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test. Moreover, to obtain general-purpose S$^2$GNNs, we propose spectrally parametrized filters for directed graphs. S$^2$GNNs outperform spatial MPGNNs, graph transformers, and graph rewirings, e.g., on the peptide long-range benchmark tasks, and are competitive with state-of-the-art sequence modeling. On a 40 GB GPU, S$^2$GNNs scale to millions of nodes.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 27 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) sequences, recognized as the golden standard for diagnosing CVDs, can clearly visualize the dynamic flow and reveal pathological conditions within the cerebrovasculature. Therefore, precise segmentation of cerebral arteries (CAs) and classification between their main trunks and branches are crucial for physicians to accurately quantify diseases. However, achieving accurate CA segmentation in DSA sequences remains a challenging task due to small vessels with low contrast, and ambiguity between vessels and residual skull structures. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets limits exploration in the field. In this paper, we introduce a DSA Sequence-based Cerebral Artery segmentation dataset (DSCA), the first publicly accessible dataset designed specifically for pixel-level semantic segmentation of CAs. Additionally, we propose DSANet, a spatio-temporal network for CA segmentation in DSA sequences. Unlike existing DSA segmentation methods that focus only on a single frame, the proposed DSANet introduces a separate temporal encoding branch to capture dynamic vessel details across multiple frames. To enhance small vessel segmentation and improve vessel connectivity, we design a novel TemporalFormer module to capture global context and correlations among sequential frames. Furthermore, we develop a Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) module to effectively integrate spatial and temporal features from the encoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSANet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in CA segmentation, achieving a Dice of 0.9033.</p></details> |  |

The increase of wearables such as GPS sensors has provided analysts with large fine-grained datasets detailing player performance. Traditional analysis of this data focuses on individual athletes with measures of internal and external loading such as distance covered in speed zones or rate of perceived exertion. However these metrics do not provide enough information to understand team dynamics within field sports. The spatio-temporal nature of match play necessitates an investment in date-engineering to adequately transform the data into a suitable format to extract features such as areas of activity. In this paper we present an approach to construct Time-Window Spatial Activity Graphs (TWGs) for field sports. Using GPS data obtained from Gaelic Football matches we demonstrate how our approach can be utilised to extract spatio-temporal features from GPS sensor data</p></details> |  |

The primary challenge in achieving precise load forecasting for EVCS lies in accounting for the nonlinear of charging behaviors, the spatial interactions among different stations, and the intricate temporal variations in usage patterns. To address these challenges, we propose a Multiscale Spatio-Temporal Enhanced Model (MSTEM) for effective load forecasting at EVCS. MSTEM incorporates a multiscale graph neural network to discern hierarchical nonlinear temporal dependencies across various time scales. Besides, it also integrates a recurrent learning component and a residual fusion mechanism, enhancing its capability to accurately capture spatial and temporal variations in charging patterns. The effectiveness of the proposed MSTEM has been validated through comparative analysis with six baseline models using three evaluation metrics. The case studies utilize real-world datasets for both fast and slow charging loads at EVCS in Perth, UK. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MSTEM in short-term continuous load forecasting for EVCS.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, AEEES 2024</p></details> |

This work addresses this task from a multimodal supervision perspective, proposing a framework for spatio-temporal action grounding trained on loose video and subtitle supervision only, without human annotation. To this end, we combine local representation learning, which focuses on leveraging fine-grained spatial information, with a global representation encoding that captures higher-level representations and incorporates both in a joint approach. To evaluate this challenging task in a real-life setting, a new benchmark dataset is proposed providing dense spatio-temporal grounding annotations in long, untrimmed, multi-action instructional videos for over 5K events.

However, this is a nontrivial problem and poses two critical challenges: sparse spatio-temporal correlation between audio-video pairs and multimodal correlation overwriting that forgets audio-video relations. To tackle this problem, we propose a new continual audio-video pre-training method with two novel ideas: (1) Localized Patch Importance Scoring: we introduce a multimodal encoder to determine the importance score for each patch, emphasizing semantically intertwined audio-video patches. (2) Replay-guided Correlation Assessment: to reduce the corruption of previously learned audiovisual knowledge due to drift, we propose to assess the correlation of the current patches on the past steps to identify the patches exhibiting high correlations with the past steps. Based on the results from the two ideas, we perform probabilistic patch selection for effective continual audio-video pre-training. Experimental validation on multiple benchmarks shows that our method achieves a 3.69%p of relative performance gain in zero-shot retrieval tasks compared to strong continual learning baselines, while reducing memory consumption by ~45%.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |

Despite the significant strides made by graph-based networks in spatio-temporal forecasting, there remain two pivotal factors closely related to forecasting performance that need further consideration: time delays in propagation dynamics and multi-scale high-dimensional interactions. In this work, we present a Series-Aligned Multi-Scale Graph Learning (SAMSGL) framework, aiming to enhance forecasting performance. In order to handle time delays in spatial interactions, we propose a series-aligned graph convolution layer to facilitate the aggregation of non-delayed graph signals, thereby mitigating the influence of time delays for the improvement in accuracy. To understand global and local spatio-temporal interactions, we develop a spatio-temporal architecture via multi-scale graph learning, which encompasses two essential components: multi-scale graph structure learning and graph-fully connected (Graph-FC) blocks. The multi-scale graph structure learning includes a global graph structure to learn both delayed and non-delayed node embeddings, as well as a local one to learn node variations influenced by neighboring factors. The Graph-FC blocks synergistically fuse spatial and temporal information to boost prediction accuracy. To evaluate the performance of SAMSGL, we conduct experiments on meteorological and traffic forecasting datasets, which demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority.</p></details> | Accepted by Chaos |

In order to summarise information encompassed in such data, we combine two well known statistical modelling methods. To account for the spatial dimension, we use the intrinsic modification of the conditional autoregression, and incorporate it with the hidden Markov model, allowing the spatial patterns to vary over time. We apply our method into parish register data considering deaths caused by measles in Finland in 1750-1850, and gain novel insight of previously undiscovered infection dynamics. Five distinctive, reoccurring states describing spatially and temporally differing infection burden and potential routes of spread are identified. We also find that there is a change in the occurrences of the most typical spatial patterns circa 1812, possibly due to changes in communication routes after major administrative transformations in Finland.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a two-stage spatio-temporal graph neural network (STGNN) framework. The first stage uses a pre-trained STGNN to process telecom data, while the second stage integrates directional and geographic insights for accurate prediction.

This issue is particularly challenging in spatio-temporal analyses, where it has been less explored so far. To study the effects of air pollution on mortality in Italy, we argue that a model that simultaneously accounts for spatio-temporal confounding and for the non-linear form of the effect of interest is needed. To this end, we propose a Bayesian dynamic generalized linear model, which allows for a non-linear association and for a decomposition of the exposure effect into two components. This decomposition accommodates associations with the outcome at fine and coarse temporal and spatial scales of variation. These features, when combined, allow reducing the spatio-temporal confounding bias and recovering the true shape of the association, as demonstrated through simulation studies. The results from the real-data application indicate that the exposure effect seems to have different magnitudes in different seasons, with peaks in the summer. We hypothesize that this could be due to possible interactions between the exposure variable with air temperature and unmeasured confounders.</p></details> | 40 pages, 11 figures |

These include simultaneous confidence intervals and tests of hypotheses, whose asymptotics is borne by a non-trivial functional central limit theorem tailored to martingale differences.

Recently, transformer based models have shown remarkable potential in weather forecasting achieving state-of-the-art results. However, transformers are discrete models which limit their ability to learn the continuous spatio-temporal features of the dynamical weather system. We address this issue with STC-ViT, a Spatio-Temporal Continuous Vision Transformer for weather forecasting. STC-ViT incorporates the continuous time Neural ODE layers with multi-head attention mechanism to learn the continuous weather evolution over time. The attention mechanism is encoded as a differentiable function in the transformer architecture to model the complex weather dynamics. We evaluate STC-ViT against a operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model and several deep learning based weather forecasting models. STC-ViT performs competitively with current data-driven methods in global forecasting while only being trained at lower resolution data and with less compute power.</p></details> |  |

However, prevailing methodologies, often focusing on synchronous BOLD signals from functional MRI (fMRI), may not capture directional influences among brain regions and rarely tackle temporal functional dynamics. In this study, we first construct the brain-effective network via the dynamic causal model. Subsequently, we introduce an interpretable graph learning framework termed Spatio-Temporal Embedding ODE (STE-ODE). This framework incorporates specifically designed directed node embedding layers, aiming at capturing the dynamic interplay between structural and effective networks via an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model, which characterizes spatial-temporal brain dynamics. Our framework is validated on several clinical phenotype prediction tasks using two independent publicly available datasets (HCP and OASIS). The experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantages of our model compared to several state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing equivariant Graph Neural Network (GNN) based methods have encapsulated the symmetry of physics, \emph{e.g.}, translations, rotations, etc, leading to better generalization ability. Nevertheless, their frame-to-frame formulation of the task overlooks the non-Markov property mainly incurred by unobserved dynamics in the environment. In this paper, we reformulate dynamics simulation as a spatio-temporal prediction task, by employing the trajectory in the past period to recover the Non-Markovian interactions. We propose Equivariant Spatio-Temporal Attentive Graph Networks (ESTAG), an equivariant version of spatio-temporal GNNs, to fulfill our purpose. At its core, we design a novel Equivariant Discrete Fourier Transform (EDFT) to extract periodic patterns from the history frames, and then construct an Equivariant Spatial Module (ESM) to accomplish spatial message passing, and an Equivariant Temporal Module (ETM) with the forward attention and equivariant pooling mechanisms to aggregate temporal message.

However, their performance is constrained by the reliance on extensive data for training on specific tasks, which limits their adaptability to new urban domains with varied demands. Although transfer learning has been proposed to address this problem by leveraging knowledge across domains, cross-task generalization remains underexplored in spatio-temporal graph transfer learning methods due to the absence of a unified framework. To bridge this gap, we propose Spatio-Temporal Graph Prompting (STGP), a prompt-enhanced transfer learning framework capable of adapting to diverse tasks in data-scarce domains. Specifically, we first unify different tasks into a single template and introduce a task-agnostic network architecture that aligns with this template. This approach enables the capture of spatio-temporal dependencies shared across tasks. Furthermore, we employ learnable prompts to achieve domain and task transfer in a two-stage prompting pipeline, enabling the prompts to effectively capture domain knowledge and task-specific properties at each stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STGP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in three downstream tasks forecasting, kriging, and extrapolation by a notable margin.</p></details> |  |

Although deep learning approaches have achieved considerable success in predicting RUL, challenges such as low prediction accuracy and interpretability pose significant challenges, hindering their practical implementation. In this work, we introduce a Spatio-temporal Attention-based Hidden Physics-informed Neural Network (STA-HPINN) for RUL prediction, which can utilize the associated physics of the system degradation. The spatio-temporal attention mechanism can extract important features from the input data. With the self-attention mechanism on both the sensor dimension and time step dimension, the proposed model can effectively extract degradation information. The hidden physics-informed neural network is utilized to capture the physics mechanisms that govern the evolution of RUL. With the constraint of physics, the model can achieve higher accuracy and reasonable predictions. The approach is validated on a benchmark dataset, demonstrating exceptional performance when compared to cutting-edge methods, especially in the case of complex conditions.</p></details> |  |

The co-dynamics can be mediated by immunosuppression or -modulation, shared environmental or climatic drivers, or competition for susceptible hosts. Research and statistical methods in epidemiology often concentrate on large pooled datasets, or high quality data from cities, leaving rural areas underrepresented in literature. Data considering rural populations are typically sparse and scarce, especially in the case of historical data sources, which may introduce considerable methodological challenges. In order to overcome many obstacles due to such data, we present a general Bayesian spatio-temporal model for disease co-dynamics. Applying the proposed model on historical (1820-1850) Finnish parish register data, we study the spread of infectious diseases in pre-healthcare Finland. We observe that measles, pertussis, and smallpox exhibit positively correlated dynamics, which could be attributed to immunosuppressive effects or, for example, the general weakening of the population due to recurring infections or poor nutritional conditions.</p></details> |  |

Specifically we consider low-rank completion of the block-Hankel matrix representation of a time-series. Simulation experiments are used to compare the method with five recognised imputation techniques with varying levels of computational effort. The Hankel Imputation (HI) method is seen to perform competitively at interpolating missing time-series data, and shows particular potential for reproducing sharp peaks in the data.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

Among the various data types available in SMS settings, time-series data plays a pivotal role. Hence, TSC emerges is crucial in this domain. The objective of this study is to fill this gap by providing a rigorous experimental evaluation of the SoTA ML and DL algorithms for TSC tasks in manufacturing and industrial settings. We first explored and compiled a comprehensive list of more than 92 SoTA algorithms from both TSC and manufacturing literature. Following, we selected the 36 most representative algorithms from this list. To evaluate their performance across various manufacturing classification tasks, we curated a set of 22 manufacturing datasets, representative of different characteristics that cover diverse manufacturing problems. Subsequently, we implemented and evaluated the algorithms on the manufacturing benchmark datasets, and analyzed the results for each dataset. Based on the results, ResNet, DrCIF, InceptionTime, and ARSENAL are the top-performing algorithms, boasting an average accuracy of over 96.6% across all 22 manufacturing TSC datasets. These findings underscore the robustness, efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness of convolutional kernels in capturing temporal features in time-series data, as three out of the top four performing algorithms leverage these kernels for feature extraction. Additionally, LSTM, BiLSTM, and TS-LSTM algorithms deserve recognition for their effectiveness in capturing features within time-series data using RNN-based structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing journal</p></details> |

We study policy gradient (PG) learning and first demonstrate convergence in a model-based setting by establishing a suitable gradient domination condition.Next, our main contribution is a comprehensive error analysis, where we prove the global linear convergence and sample complexity of the PG algorithm with two-point gradient estimates in a model-free setting with unknown parameters. In this setting, the parameterized optimal policies are learned from samples of the states and population distribution.Finally, we provide numerical evidence supporting the convergence of our implemented algorithms.</p></details> | 67 pages |

Compared with vision-aided and LiDAR-aided INS, radar-aided INS could achieve better performance in adverse weather conditions since the radar utilizes low-frequency measuring signals with less attenuation effect in atmospheric gases and rain. For such a radar-aided INS, accurate spatiotemporal transformation is a fundamental prerequisite to achieving optimal information fusion. In this work, we present RIs-Calib: a spatiotemporal calibrator for multiple 3D radars and IMUs based on continuous-time estimation, which enables accurate spatiotemporal calibration and does not require any additional artificial infrastructure or prior knowledge. Our approach starts with a rigorous and robust procedure for state initialization, followed by batch optimizations, where all parameters can be refined to global optimal states steadily. We validate and evaluate RIs-Calib on both simulated and real-world experiments, and the results demonstrate that RIs-Calib is capable of accurate and consistent calibration. We open-source our implementations at (https://github.com/Unsigned-Long/RIs-Calib) to benefit the research community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Principal Components Analysis of Irregularly Observed Functional Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02343v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregularly observed functional time series (FTS) are increasingly available in many real-world applications. To analyze FTS, it is crucial to account for both serial dependencies and the irregularly observed nature of functional data. However, existing methods for FTS often rely on specific model assumptions in capturing serial dependencies, or cannot handle the irregular observational scheme of functional data. To solve these issues, one can perform dimension reduction on FTS via functional principal component analysis (FPCA) or dynamic FPCA. Nonetheless, these methods may either be not theoretically optimal or too redundant to represent serially dependent functional data. In this article, we introduce a novel dimension reduction method for FTS based on dynamic FPCA. Through a new concept called optimal functional filters, we unify the theories of FPCA and dynamic FPCA, providing a parsimonious and optimal representation for FTS adapting to its serial dependence structure. This framework is referred to as principal analysis via dependency-adaptivity (PADA). Under a hierarchical Bayesian model, we establish an estimation procedure for dimension reduction via PADA. Our method can be used for both sparsely and densely observed FTS, and is capable of predicting future functional data. We investigate the theoretical properties of PADA and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive simulation studies. Finally, we illustrate our method via dimension reduction and prediction of daily PM2.5 data.</p></details> |  |

Such manoeuvring flight envelope variations, governed by the aircraft's complex nonlinear dynamics, are unpredictable by pilots and existing flight management systems. To prevent in-flight Loss of Control, post-failure trajectories must be optimal, planned in real-time, avoid terrain, and adhere to the impaired aircraft's reduced manoeuvrability and dynamic constraints. This paper presents a novel real-time trajectory optimization method for impaired aircraft based on a combination of differential flatness theory, the pseudospectral method, nonlinear programming, and inverse dynamics. In the proposed method, which utilizes a high-fidelity nonlinear six degree-of-freedom model, to conform to aircraft's altered dynamics a sequence of trim points is selected from the impaired aircraft's manoeuvring flight envelope based on the chosen optimization criteria, ensuring that the resulting three-dimensional trajectory observes terrain avoidance. Then, the required control inputs are obtained for each manoeuvre in less than a second. The method is applied to the NASA Generic Transport Model with rudder failure near a complex mountainous terrain. Both an optimal one-piece trajectory and a near-optimal piecewise path consisting of several optimal trajectories, are generated in non-real-time and real-time, respectively, and compared. Results show that the near-optimal real-time trajectory retains up to 80% of the optimality.</p></details> | <details><summary>56 pa...</summary><p>56 pages, 21 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[DRFormer: Multi-Scale Transformer Utilizing Diverse Receptive Fields for Long Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02279v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) has been widely applied in finance, traffic prediction, and other domains. Recently, patch-based transformers have emerged as a promising approach, segmenting data into sub-level patches that serve as input tokens. However, existing methods mostly rely on predetermined patch lengths, necessitating expert knowledge and posing challenges in capturing diverse characteristics across various scales. Moreover, time series data exhibit diverse variations and fluctuations across different temporal scales, which traditional approaches struggle to model effectively. In this paper, we propose a dynamic tokenizer with a dynamic sparse learning algorithm to capture diverse receptive fields and sparse patterns of time series data. In order to build hierarchical receptive fields, we develop a multi-scale Transformer model, coupled with multi-scale sequence extraction, capable of capturing multi-resolution features. Additionally, we introduce a group-aware rotary position encoding technique to enhance intra- and inter-group position awareness among representations across different temporal scales. Our proposed model, named DRFormer, is evaluated on various real-world datasets, and experimental results demonstrate its superiority compared to existing methods. Our code is available at: https://github.com/ruixindingECNU/DRFormer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear Perturbation-based Non-Convex Optimization over Time-Varying Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02269v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decentralized optimization strategies are helpful for various applications, from networked estimation to distributed machine learning. This paper studies finite-sum minimization problems described over a network of nodes and proposes a computationally efficient algorithm that solves distributed convex problems and optimally finds the solution to locally non-convex objective functions. In contrast to batch gradient optimization in some literature, our algorithm is on a single-time scale with no extra inner consensus loop. It evaluates one gradient entry per node per time. Further, the algorithm addresses link-level nonlinearity representing, for example, logarithmic quantization of the exchanged data or clipping of the exchanged data bits. Leveraging perturbation-based theory and algebraic Laplacian network analysis proves optimal convergence and dynamics stability over time-varying and switching networks. The time-varying network setup might be due to packet drops or link failures. Despite the nonlinear nature of the dynamics, we prove exact convergence in the face of odd sign-preserving sector-bound nonlinear data transmission over the links. Illustrative numerical simulations further highlight our contributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transaction on Network Science and Engineering</p></details> |

Its applicability to capture the dependencies on watersheds to forecast better within a short period is fascinating. One of the key reasons to adopt ML algorithms over physics-based models is its computational efficiency advantage and flexibility to work with various data sets. The diverse applications, particularly in emergency response and expanding over a large scale, demand the hydrological model in a short time and make researchers adopt data-driven modeling approaches unhesitatingly. In this work, in the era of ML and deep learning (DL), how it can help to improve the overall run time of physics-based model and potential constraints that should be addressed while modeling. This paper covers the opportunities and challenges of adopting ML for hydrological modeling and subsequently how it can help to improve the simulation time of physics-based models and future works that should be addressed.</p></details> |  |
| **[SeqLink: A Robust Neural-ODE Architecture for Modelling Partially Observed Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03560v3)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) based models have become popular as foundation models for solving many time series problems. Combining neural ODEs with traditional RNN models has provided the best representation for irregular time series. However, ODE-based models typically require the trajectory of hidden states to be defined based on either the initial observed value or the most recent observation, raising questions about their effectiveness when dealing with longer sequences and extended time intervals. In this article, we explore the behaviour of the ODE models in the context of time series data with varying degrees of sparsity. We introduce SeqLink, an innovative neural architecture designed to enhance the robustness of sequence representation. Unlike traditional approaches that solely rely on the hidden state generated from the last observed value, SeqLink leverages ODE latent representations derived from multiple data samples, enabling it to generate robust data representations regardless of sequence length or data sparsity level. The core concept behind our model is the definition of hidden states for the unobserved values based on the relationships between samples (links between sequences). Through extensive experiments on partially observed synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that SeqLink improves the modelling of intermittent time series, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[The projected dynamic linear model for time series on the sphere](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14996v2)** | 2024-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series on the unit n-sphere arise in directional statistics, compositional data analysis, and many scientific fields. There are few models for such data, and the ones that exist suffer from several limitations: they are often computationally challenging to fit, many of them apply only to the circular case of n=2, and they are usually based on families of distributions that are not flexible enough to capture the complexities observed in real data. Furthermore, there is little work on Bayesian methods for spherical time series. To address these shortcomings, we propose a state space model based on the projected normal distribution that can be applied to spherical time series of arbitrary dimension. We describe how to perform fully Bayesian offline inference for this model using a simple and efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm, and we develop a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter to perform online inference for streaming data. In analyses of wind direction and energy market time series, we show that the proposed model outperforms competitors in terms of point, set, and density forecasting.</p></details> | 28 pages, 8 figures |

This new algorithm leverages the concept of similarity and higher-order temporal interactions across multiple time scales to enhance predictive accuracy and interpretability in forecasting. To evaluate the effectiveness of SPINEX, we present comprehensive benchmarking experiments comparing it against 18 algorithms and across 49 synthetic and real datasets characterized by varying trends, seasonality, and noise levels. Our performance assessment focused on forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency. Our findings reveal that SPINEX consistently ranks among the top 5 performers in forecasting precision and has a superior ability to handle complex temporal dynamics compared to commonly adopted algorithms. Moreover, the algorithm's explainability features, Pareto efficiency, and medium complexity (on the order of O(log n)) are demonstrated through detailed visualizations to enhance the prediction and decision-making process. We note that integrating similarity-based concepts opens new avenues for research in predictive analytics, promising more accurate and transparent decision making.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Look at Value-Based Decision-Time vs. Background Planning Methods Across Different Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08442v2)** | 2024-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In model-based reinforcement learning (RL), an agent can leverage a learned model to improve its way of behaving in different ways. Two of the prevalent ways to do this are through decision-time and background planning methods. In this study, we are interested in understanding how the value-based versions of these two planning methods will compare against each other across different settings. Towards this goal, we first consider the simplest instantiations of value-based decision-time and background planning methods and provide theoretical results on which one will perform better in the regular RL and transfer learning settings. Then, we consider the modern instantiations of them and provide hypotheses on which one will perform better in the same settings. Finally, we perform illustrative experiments to validate these theoretical results and hypotheses. Overall, our findings suggest that even though value-based versions of the two planning methods perform on par in their simplest instantiations, the modern instantiations of value-based decision-time planning methods can perform on par or better than the modern instantiations of value-based background planning methods in both the regular RL and transfer learning settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EWRL 2024</p></details> |
| **[ISMRNN: An Implicitly Segmented RNN Method with Mamba for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10768v5)** | 2024-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long time series forecasting aims to utilize historical information to forecast future states over extended horizons. Traditional RNN-based series forecasting methods struggle to effectively address long-term dependencies and gradient issues in long time series problems. Recently, SegRNN has emerged as a leading RNN-based model tailored for long-term series forecasting, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a streamlined architecture through innovative segmentation and parallel decoding techniques. Nevertheless, SegRNN has several limitations: its fixed segmentation disrupts data continuity and fails to effectively leverage information across different segments, the segmentation strategy employed by SegRNN does not fundamentally address the issue of information loss within the recurrent structure. To address these issues, we propose the ISMRNN method with three key enhancements: we introduce an implicit segmentation structure to decompose the time series and map it to segmented hidden states, resulting in denser information exchange during the segmentation phase. Additionally, we incorporate residual structures in the encoding layer to mitigate information loss within the recurrent structure. To extract information more effectively, we further integrate the Mamba architecture to enhance time series information extraction. Experiments on several real-world long time series forecasting datasets demonstrate that our model surpasses the performance of current state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Class-incremental Learning for Time Series: Benchmark and Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12035v2)** | 2024-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world environments are inherently non-stationary, frequently introducing new classes over time. This is especially common in time series classification, such as the emergence of new disease classification in healthcare or the addition of new activities in human activity recognition. In such cases, a learning system is required to assimilate novel classes effectively while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of the old ones, which gives rise to the Class-incremental Learning (CIL) problem. However, despite the encouraging progress in the image and language domains, CIL for time series data remains relatively understudied. Existing studies suffer from inconsistent experimental designs, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation and benchmarking of methods across a wide range of datasets. To this end, we first present an overview of the Time Series Class-incremental Learning (TSCIL) problem, highlight its unique challenges, and cover the advanced methodologies. Further, based on standardized settings, we develop a unified experimental framework that supports the rapid development of new algorithms, easy integration of new datasets, and standardization of the evaluation process. Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various generic and time-series-specific CIL methods in both standard and privacy-sensitive scenarios. Our extensive experiments not only provide a standard baseline to support future research but also shed light on the impact of various design factors such as normalization layers or memory budget thresholds.

Classical force field (FF) methods often rely on insufficient local energy minimization, while neural network FF models require large labeled datasets encompassing both equilibrium and non-equilibrium structures. As a remedy, we propose MoreRed, molecular relaxation by reverse diffusion, a conceptually novel and purely statistical approach where non-equilibrium structures are treated as noisy instances of their corresponding equilibrium states. To enable the denoising of arbitrarily noisy inputs via a generative diffusion model, we further introduce a novel diffusion time step predictor. Notably, MoreRed learns a simpler pseudo potential energy surface (PES) instead of the complex physical PES. It is trained on a significantly smaller, and thus computationally cheaper, dataset consisting of solely unlabeled equilibrium structures, avoiding the computation of non-equilibrium structures altogether. We compare MoreRed to classical FFs, equivariant neural network FFs trained on a large dataset of equilibrium and non-equilibrium data, as well as a semi-empirical tight-binding model. To assess this quantitatively, we evaluate the root-mean-square deviation between the found equilibrium structures and the reference equilibrium structures as well as their energies.</p></details> |  |
| **[CuckooGraph: A Scalable and Space-Time Efficient Data Structure for Large-Scale Dynamic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15193v2)** | 2024-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs play an increasingly important role in various big data applications. However, existing graph data structures cannot simultaneously address the performance bottlenecks caused by the dynamic updates, large scale, and high query complexity of current graphs. This paper proposes a novel data structure for large-scale dynamic graphs called CuckooGraph. It does not require any prior knowledge of the upcoming graphs, and can adaptively resize to the most memory-efficient form while requiring few memory accesses for very fast graph data processing. The key techniques of CuckooGraph include TRANSFORMATION and DENYLIST. TRANSFORMATION fully utilizes the limited memory by designing related data structures that allow flexible space transformations to smoothly expand/tighten the required space depending on the number of incoming items. DENYLIST efficiently handles item insertion failures and further improves processing speed. Our experimental results show that compared with the most competitive solution Spruce, CuckooGraph achieves about $33\times$ higher insertion throughput while requiring only about $68\%$ of the memory space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Model Pruning and Resource Allocation for Wireless Time-triggered Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01765v1)** | 2024-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-triggered federated learning, in contrast to conventional event-based federated learning, organizes users into tiers based on fixed time intervals. However, this network still faces challenges due to a growing number of devices and limited wireless bandwidth, increasing issues like stragglers and communication overhead. In this paper, we apply model pruning to wireless Time-triggered systems and jointly study the problem of optimizing the pruning ratio and bandwidth allocation to minimize training loss under communication latency constraints. To solve this joint optimization problem, we perform a convergence analysis on the gradient $l_2$-norm of the asynchronous multi-tier federated learning (FL) model with adaptive model pruning. The convergence upper bound is derived and a joint optimization problem of pruning ratio and wireless bandwidth is defined to minimize the model training loss under a given communication latency constraint. The closed-form solutions for wireless bandwidth and pruning ratio by using KKT conditions are then formulated. As indicated in the simulation experiments, our proposed TT-Prune demonstrates a 40% reduction in communication cost, compared with the asynchronous multi-tier FL without model pruning, while maintaining the model convergence at the same level.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Global Communications Conference 2024</p></details> |
| **[Real-time Hybrid System Identification with Online Deterministic Annealing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01730v1)** | 2024-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a real-time identification method for discrete-time state-dependent switching systems in both the input--output and state-space domains. In particular, we design a system of adaptive algorithms running in two timescales; a stochastic approximation algorithm implements an online deterministic annealing scheme at a slow timescale and estimates the mode-switching signal, and an recursive identification algorithm runs at a faster timescale and updates the parameters of the local models based on the estimate of the switching signal. We first focus on piece-wise affine systems and discuss identifiability conditions and convergence properties based on the theory of two-timescale stochastic approximation. In contrast to standard identification algorithms for switched systems, the proposed approach gradually estimates the number of modes and is appropriate for real-time system identification using sequential data acquisition. The progressive nature of the algorithm improves computational efficiency and provides real-time control over the performance-complexity trade-off. Finally, we address specific challenges that arise in the application of the proposed methodology in identification of more general switching systems. Simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributed Adaptive Time-Varying Optimization with Global Asymptotic Convergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20897v2)** | 2024-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this note, we study distributed time-varying optimization for a multi-agent system. We first focus on a class of time-varying quadratic cost functions, and develop a new distributed algorithm that integrates an average estimator and an adaptive optimizer, with both bridged by a Dead Zone Algorithm. Based on a composite Lyapunov function and finite escape-time analysis, we prove the closed-loop global asymptotic convergence to the optimal solution under mild assumptions. Particularly, the introduction of the estimator relaxes the requirement for the Hessians of cost functions, and the integrated design eliminates the waiting time required in the relevant literature for estimating global parameter during algorithm implementation. We then extend this result to a more general class of time-varying cost functions. Two examples are used to verify the proposed designs.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |

However, their expensive computational cost makes real-time inference impractical. By characterizing attention maps of the network, we identify two key obstacles in AVS models: 1) attention dissipation, corresponding to the over-concentrated attention weights by Softmax within restricted frames, and 2) inefficient, burdensome transformer decoder, caused by narrow focus patterns in early stages. In this paper, we introduce AVESFormer, the first real-time Audio-Visual Efficient Segmentation transformer that achieves fast, efficient and light-weight simultaneously. Our model leverages an efficient prompt query generator to correct the behaviour of cross-attention. Additionally, we propose ELF decoder to bring greater efficiency by facilitating convolutions suitable for local features to reduce computational burdens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our AVESFormer significantly enhances model performance, achieving 79.9% on S4, 57.9% on MS3 and 31.2% on AVSS, outperforming previous state-of-the-art and achieving an excellent trade-off between performance and speed.

| **[Robust Implementation of Discrete-time Quantum Walks in Any Finite-dimensional Quantum System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00530v2)** | 2024-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research has shown that quantum walks can accelerate certain quantum algorithms and act as a universal paradigm for quantum processing. The discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW) model, owing to its discrete nature, stands out as one of the most suitable choices for circuit implementation. Nevertheless, most current implementations are characterized by extensive, multi-layered quantum circuits, leading to higher computational expenses and a notable decrease in the number of confidently executable time steps on current quantum computers. Since quantum computers are not scalable enough in this NISQ era, we also must confine ourselves to the ancilla-free frontier zone. Therefore, in this paper, we have successfully cut down the circuit cost concerning gate count and circuit depth by half through our proposed methodology in qubit systems as compared to the state-of-the-art increment-decrement approach. Furthermore, for the engineering excellence of our proposed approach, we implement DTQW in any finite-dimensional quantum system with akin efficiency. To ensure an efficient implementation of quantum walks without requiring ancilla, we have incorporated an intermediate qudit technique for decomposing multi-qubit gates. Experimental outcomes hold significance far beyond the realm of just a few time steps, laying the groundwork for dependable implementation and utilization on quantum computers.</p></details> | 13 pages, 21 figures |

They affect the quality and reliability of clinical research and patient care. Manual annotation of artifacts is costly and time-consuming, rendering it impractical. Automated methods are desired. Here, we propose a novel fully unsupervised approach to detect artifacts in clinical-standard, minute-by-minute resolution ICU data without any prior labeling or signal-specific knowledge. Our approach combines a variational autoencoder (VAE) and an isolation forest (IF) into a hybrid model to learn features and identify anomalies in different types of vital signs, such as blood pressure, heart rate, and intracranial pressure. We evaluate our approach on a real-world ICU dataset and compare it with supervised benchmark models based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and XGBoost and statistical methods such as ARIMA. We show that our unsupervised approach achieves comparable sensitivity to fully supervised methods and generalizes well to an external dataset. We also visualize the latent space learned by the VAE and demonstrate its ability to disentangle clean and noisy samples. Our approach offers a promising solution for cleaning ICU data in clinical research and practice without the need for any labels whatsoever.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Interfering Sources in Shared Queues for Timely Computations in Edge Computing Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01327v1)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing stochastic models on age of information (AoI) focus on a single shared server serving status update packets from $N>1$ sources where each packet update stream is Poisson, i.e., single-hop scenario. In the current work, we study a two-hop edge computing system for which status updates from the information sources are still Poisson but they are not immediately available at the shared edge server, but instead they need to first receive service from a transmission server dedicated to each source. For exponentially distributed and heterogeneous service times for both the dedicated servers and the edge server, and bufferless preemptive resource management, we develop an analytical model using absorbing Markov chains (AMC) for obtaining the distribution of AoI for any source in the system. Moreover, for a given tagged source, the traffic arriving at the shared server from the $N-1$ un-tagged sources, namely the interference traffic, is not Poisson any more, but is instead a Markov modulated Poisson process (MMPP) whose state space grows exponentially with $N$. Therefore, we propose to employ a model reduction technique that approximates the behavior of the MMPP interference traffic with two states only, making it possible to approximately obtain the AoI statistics even for a very large number of sources. Numerical examples are presented to validate the proposed exact and approximate models.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

The quality of a dynamic algorithm is measured in terms of its approximation ratio, "recourse" (the number of changes in $S$ per update) and "update time" (the time it takes to handle an update). The ultimate goal in this line of research is to obtain a dynamic $O(1)$ approximation algorithm with $\tilde{O}(1)$ recourse and $\tilde{O}(k)$ update time. Dynamic $k$-median is a canonical example of a class of problems known as dynamic $k$-clustering, that has received significant attention in recent years. To the best of our knowledge, however, previous papers either attempt to minimize the algorithm's recourse while ignoring its update time, or minimize the algorithm's update time while ignoring its recourse. For dynamic $k$-median, we come arbitrarily close to resolving the main open question on this topic, with the following results. (I) We develop a new framework of randomized local search that is suitable for adaptation in a dynamic setting. For every $\epsilon > 0$, this gives us a dynamic $k$-median algorithm with $O(1/\epsilon)$ approximation ratio, $\tilde{O}(k^{\epsilon})$ recourse and $\tilde{O}(k^{1+\epsilon})$ update time. This framework also generalizes to dynamic $k$-clustering with $\ell^p$-norm objectives, giving similar bounds for the dynamic $k$-means and a new trade-off for dynamic $k$-center. (II) If it suffices to maintain only an estimate of the value of the optimal $k$-median objective, then we obtain a $O(1)$ approximation algorithm with $\tilde{O}(k)$ update time. We achieve this result via adapting the Lagrangian Relaxation framework to the dynamic setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at FOCS 2024</p></details> |

It operates mainly by imposing data, learning, or architecture bias with simulation data, Partial Differential Equations, or equivariance and invariance properties. While it has shown great success on tasks involving one physical domain, such as fluid dynamics, existing methods are not adapted to tasks with complex multi-physical and multi-domain phenomena. In addition, it is mainly formulated as an end-to-end learning scheme. To address these challenges, we propose to leverage Bond Graphs, a multi-physics modeling approach, together with Message Passing Graph Neural Networks. We propose a Neural Bond graph Encoder (NBgE) producing multi-physics-informed representations that can be fed into any task-specific model. It provides a unified way to integrate both data and architecture biases in deep learning. Our experiments on two challenging multi-domain physical systems - a Direct Current Motor and the Respiratory System - demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a multivariate time-series forecasting task.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, paper under review</p></details> |

However, using k-fold cross-validation instead of holdout validation drastically increases the computational cost of validating a single configuration. While ensuring better generalization and, by extension, better performance, the additional cost is often prohibitive for effective model selection within a time budget. We aim to make model selection with cross-validation more effective. Therefore, we study early stopping the process of cross-validation during model selection. We investigate the impact of early stopping on random search for two algorithms, MLP and random forest, across 36 classification datasets. We further analyze the impact of the number of folds by considering 3-, 5-, and 10-folds. In addition, we investigate the impact of early stopping with Bayesian optimization instead of random search and also repeated cross-validation. Our exploratory study shows that even a simple-to-understand and easy-to-implement method consistently allows model selection to converge faster; in ~94% of all datasets, on average by ~214%. Moreover, stopping cross-validation enables model selection to explore the search space more exhaustively by considering +167% configurations on average within one hour, while also obtaining better overall performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Third International Conference on Automated Machine Learning (AutoML 2024); for code, see https://github.com/automl/DontWasteYourTime-early-stopping</p></details> |
| **[Fine-grained Attention in Hierarchical Transformers for Tabular Time-series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15327v2)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tabular data is ubiquitous in many real-life systems. In particular, time-dependent tabular data, where rows are chronologically related, is typically used for recording historical events, e.g., financial transactions, healthcare records, or stock history. Recently, hierarchical variants of the attention mechanism of transformer architectures have been used to model tabular time-series data. At first, rows (or columns) are encoded separately by computing attention between their fields. Subsequently, encoded rows (or columns) are attended to one another to model the entire tabular time-series. While efficient, this approach constrains the attention granularity and limits its ability to learn patterns at the field-level across separate rows, or columns. We take a first step to address this gap by proposing Fieldy, a fine-grained hierarchical model that contextualizes fields at both the row and column levels. We compare our proposal against state of the art models on regression and classification tasks using public tabular time-series datasets. Our results show that combining row-wise and column-wise attention improves performance without increasing model size. Code and data are available at https://github.com/raphaaal/fieldy.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages; Camera Ready version</p></details> |

Famously, the 2017 multi-messenger observation of GW170817 led to scientific discoveries across cosmology, nuclear physics, and gravity. Central to these results were the sky localization and distance obtained from GW data, which, in the case of GW170817, helped to identify the associated EM transient, AT 2017gfo, 11 hours after the GW signal. Fast analysis of GW data is critical for directing time-sensitive EM observations; however, due to challenges arising from the length and complexity of signals, it is often necessary to make approximations that sacrifice accuracy. Here, we present a machine learning framework that performs complete BNS inference in just one second without making any such approximations. Our approach enhances multi-messenger observations by providing (i) accurate localization even before the merger; (ii) improved localization precision by $\sim30\%$ compared to approximate low-latency methods; and (iii) detailed information on luminosity distance, inclination, and masses, which can be used to prioritize expensive telescope time. Additionally, the flexibility and reduced cost of our method open new opportunities for equation-of-state studies. Finally, we demonstrate that our method scales to extremely long signals, up to an hour in length, thus serving as a blueprint for data analysis for next-generation ground- and space-based detectors.</p></details> | <details><summary>8+8 p...</summary><p>8+8 pages, 3+7 figures</p></details> |

We show (by numerical experiments) that this is indeed possible: within some range of parameters, any random score of spike trains (for all neurons in the network) can be robustly memorized and autonomously reproduced with stable accurate relative timing of all spikes, with probability close to one. We also demonstrate associative recall under noisy conditions. In these experiments, the required synaptic weights are computed offline, to satisfy a template that encourages temporal stability.</p></details> |  |

A significant challenge in using such model is their fast and accurate calibration to observed data from geo-referenced hospitalized data, i.e., efficient estimation of the spatial-/time-varying parameters. In this work, a new calibration framework is proposed towards optimizing the spatial-/time-varying parameters of the SEIR model. We also devise a method for combing the overlapping sliding window technique (OSW) with a genetic algorithm (GA) calibration routine to automatically search the segmented parameter space. Parallelized GA is used to reduce the computational burden. Our framework abstracts the implementation complexity of the method away from the user. It provides high-level APIs for setting up a customized calibration system and consuming the optimized values of parameters. We evaluated the application of our method on the calibration of a spatial age-structured microsimulation model using a single objective function that comprises observed COVID-19-related ICU demand. The results reflect the effectiveness of the proposed method towards estimating the parameters in a changing environment.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Empirical Analysis of EIP-3675: Miner Dynamics, Transaction Fees, and Transaction Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17885v2)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Ethereum Improvement Proposal 3675 (EIP-3675) marks a significant shift, transitioning from a Proof of Work (PoW) to a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This transition resulted in a staggering 99.95% decrease in energy consumption. However, the transition prompts two critical questions: (1). How does EIP-3675 affect miners' dynamics? and (2). How do users determine priority fees, considering that paying too little may cause delays or non-inclusion, yet paying too much wastes money with little to no benefits? To address the first question, we present a comprehensive empirical study examining EIP-3675's effect on miner dynamics (i.e., miner participation, distribution, and the degree of randomness in miner selection). Our findings reveal that the transition has encouraged broader participation of miners in block append operation, resulting in a larger pool of unique miners ($\approx50\times$ PoW), and the change in miner distribution with the increased number of unique small category miners ($\approx60\times$ PoW). However, there is an unintended consequence: a reduction in the miner selection randomness, which signifies the negative impact of the transition to PoS-Ethereum on network decentralization. Regarding the second question, we employed regression-based machine learning models; the Gradient Boosting Regressor performed best in predicting priority fees, while the K-Neighbours Regressor was worst.</p></details> | Revised version |
| **[Corki: Enabling Real-time Embodied AI Robots via Algorithm-Architecture Co-Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04292v3)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied AI robots have the potential to fundamentally improve the way human beings live and manufacture. Continued progress in the burgeoning field of using large language models to control robots depends critically on an efficient computing substrate. In particular, today's computing systems for embodied AI robots are designed purely based on the interest of algorithm developers, where robot actions are divided into a discrete frame-basis. Such an execution pipeline creates high latency and energy consumption. This paper proposes Corki, an algorithm-architecture co-design framework for real-time embodied AI robot control. Our idea is to decouple LLM inference, robotic control and data communication in the embodied AI robots compute pipeline. Instead of predicting action for one single frame, Corki predicts the trajectory for the near future to reduce the frequency of LLM inference. The algorithm is coupled with a hardware that accelerates transforming trajectory into actual torque signals used to control robots and an execution pipeline that parallels data communication with computation. Corki largely reduces LLM inference frequency by up to 8.0x, resulting in up to 3.6x speed up. The success rate improvement can be up to 17.3%. Code is provided for re-implementation. https://github.com/hyy0613/Corki</p></details> |  |
| **[A marginalized three-part interrupted time series regression model for proportional data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09996v2)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interrupted time series (ITS) is often used to evaluate the effectiveness of a health policy intervention that accounts for the temporal dependence of outcomes. When the outcome of interest is a percentage or percentile, the data can be highly skewed, bounded in $[0, 1]$, and have many zeros or ones. A three-part Beta regression model is commonly used to separate zeros, ones, and positive values explicitly by three submodels. However, incorporating temporal dependence into the three-part Beta regression model is challenging. In this article, we propose a marginalized zero-one-inflated Beta time series model that captures the temporal dependence of outcomes through copula and allows investigators to examine covariate effects on the marginal mean. We investigate its practical performance using simulation studies and apply the model to a real ITS study.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-time Dexterous Telemanipulation with an End-Effect-Oriented Learning-based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00853v1)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dexterous telemanipulation is crucial in advancing human-robot systems, especially in tasks requiring precise and safe manipulation. However, it faces significant challenges due to the physical differences between human and robotic hands, the dynamic interaction with objects, and the indirect control and perception of the remote environment. Current approaches predominantly focus on mapping the human hand onto robotic counterparts to replicate motions, which exhibits a critical oversight: it often neglects the physical interaction with objects and relegates the interaction burden to the human to adapt and make laborious adjustments in response to the indirect and counter-intuitive observation of the remote environment. This work develops an End-Effects-Oriented Learning-based Dexterous Telemanipulation (EFOLD) framework to address telemanipulation tasks. EFOLD models telemanipulation as a Markov Game, introducing multiple end-effect features to interpret the human operator's commands during interaction with objects. These features are used by a Deep Reinforcement Learning policy to control the robot and reproduce such end effects. EFOLD was evaluated with real human subjects and two end-effect extraction methods for controlling a virtual Shadow Robot Hand in telemanipulation tasks. EFOLD achieved real-time control capability with low command following latency (delay<0.11s) and highly accurate tracking (MSE<0.084 rad).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2024</p></details> |

This work shows the implementation and the testing results of a GNSS security impact simulator which injects the desired threat scenarios as a deviations on the GNSS actual measurements. The proposed simulator can be integrated in both real- and fast-time simulation environments.

First, we propose the quota lawn mowing problem, an extension of the classic lawn mowing problem in computational geometry, as follows: given a quota of coverage, compute the shortest lawn mowing route to achieve said quota. We give constant-factor approximations for the quota lawn mowing problem. Second, we investigate the expected detection time minimization problem in geometric coverage path planning with local, continuous sensory information. We provide the first approximation algorithm with provable error bounds with pseudopolynomial running time. Our ideas also extend to another search mechanism, namely visibility-based search, which is related to the watchman route problem. We complement our theoretical analysis with some simple but effective heuristics for finding an object in minimum expected time, on which we provide simulation results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph neural network-based surrogate modelling for real-time hydraulic prediction of urban drainage networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10324v2)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-based models are computationally time-consuming and infeasible for real-time scenarios of urban drainage networks, and a surrogate model is needed to accelerate the online predictive modelling. Fully-connected neural networks (NNs) are potential surrogate models, but may suffer from low interpretability and efficiency in fitting complex targets. Owing to the state-of-the-art modelling power of graph neural networks (GNNs) and their match with urban drainage networks in the graph structure, this work proposes a GNN-based surrogate of the flow routing model for the hydraulic prediction problem of drainage networks, which regards recent hydraulic states as initial conditions, and future runoff and control policy as boundary conditions. To incorporate hydraulic constraints and physical relationships into drainage modelling, physics-guided mechanisms are designed on top of the surrogate model to restrict the prediction variables with flow balance and flooding occurrence constraints. According to case results in a stormwater network, the GNN-based model is more cost-effective with better hydraulic prediction accuracy than the NN-based model after equal training epochs, and the designed mechanisms further limit prediction errors with interpretable domain knowledge. As the model structure adheres to the flow routing mechanisms and hydraulic constraints in urban drainage networks, it provides an interpretable and effective solution for data-driven surrogate modelling. Simultaneously, the surrogate model accelerates the predictive modelling of urban drainage networks for real-time use compared with the physics-based model.</p></details> |  |
| **[GNSS/Multi-Sensor Fusion Using Continuous-Time Factor Graph Optimization for Robust Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11134v3)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and robust vehicle localization in highly urbanized areas is challenging. Sensors are often corrupted in those complicated and large-scale environments. This paper introduces GNSS-FGO, an online and global trajectory estimator that fuses GNSS observations alongside multiple sensor measurements for robust vehicle localization. In GNSS-FGO, we fuse asynchronous sensor measurements into the graph with a continuous-time trajectory representation using Gaussian process regression. This enables querying states at arbitrary timestamps so that sensor observations are fused without requiring strict state and measurement synchronization. Thus, the proposed method presents a generalized factor graph for multi-sensor fusion. To evaluate and study different GNSS fusion strategies, we fuse GNSS measurements in loose and tight coupling with a speed sensor, IMU, and lidar-odometry. We employed datasets from measurement campaigns in Aachen, Duesseldorf, and Cologne in experimental studies and presented comprehensive discussions on sensor observations, smoother types, and hyperparameter tuning. Our results show that the proposed approach enables robust trajectory estimation in dense urban areas, where the classic multi-sensor fusion method fails due to sensor degradation. In a test sequence containing a 17km route through Aachen, the proposed method results in a mean 2D positioning error of 0.48m while fusing raw GNSS observations with lidar odometry in a tight coupling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |

Simultaneous high values of convective available potential energy (CAPE) and storm relative helicity (SRH) are favorable to severe weather, and both they and the composite variable $\mathrm{PROD}=\sqrt{\mathrm{CAPE}} \times \mathrm{SRH}$ can be used as indicators of severe thunderstorm activity. Their extremal spatial dependence exhibits temporal non-stationarity due to seasonality and large-scale atmospheric signals such as El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In order to investigate this, we introduce a space-time model based on a max-stable, Brown--Resnick, field whose range depends on ENSO and on time through a tensor product spline. We also propose a max-stability test based on empirical likelihood and the bootstrap. The marginal and dependence parameters must be estimated separately owing to the complexity of the model, and we develop a bootstrap-based model selection criterion that accounts for the marginal uncertainty when choosing the dependence model. In the case study, the out-sample performance of our model is good. We find that extremes of PROD, CAPE and SRH are generally more localized in summer and, in some regions, less localized during El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na events, and give meteorological interpretations of these phenomena.</p></details> |  |

The use of a space-time discretization with smooth basis functions yields advantages in the approximation of the solution. The existence of the unique solution for continuous and discrete space-time variational formulations is proven. We also establish the a priori error estimate for the space-time isogeometric scheme. The non-linear system is linearized through Picard's method and a suitable preconditioner for the linearized system is provided.

| **[Causal Inference for Continuous Multiple Time Point Interventions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06645v3)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are limited options to estimate the treatment effects of variables which are continuous and measured at multiple time points, particularly if the true dose-response curve should be estimated as closely as possible. However, these situations may be of relevance: in pharmacology, one may be interested in how outcomes of people living with -- and treated for -- HIV, such as viral failure, would vary for time-varying interventions such as different drug concentration trajectories. A challenge for doing causal inference with continuous interventions is that the positivity assumption is typically violated. To address positivity violations, we develop projection functions, which reweigh and redefine the estimand of interest based on functions of the conditional support for the respective interventions. With these functions, we obtain the desired dose-response curve in areas of enough support, and otherwise a meaningful estimand that does not require the positivity assumption. We develop $g$-computation type plug-in estimators for this case. Those are contrasted with g-computation estimators which are applied to continuous interventions without specifically addressing positivity violations, which we propose to be presented with diagnostics. The ideas are illustrated with longitudinal data from HIV positive children treated with an efavirenz-based regimen as part of the CHAPAS-3 trial, which enrolled children $<13$ years in Zambia/Uganda. Simulations show in which situations a standard g-computation approach is appropriate, and in which it leads to bias and how the proposed weighted estimation approach then recovers the alternative estimand of interest.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods rely on resource-intensive transformer architectures, which often lead to significant drops in computational efficiency and performance when handling long sequence data. To address these challenges and advance monocular 3D object detection technology, we propose an innovative network architecture, MonoMM, a Multi-scale \textbf{M}amba-Enhanced network for real-time Monocular 3D object detection. This well-designed architecture primarily includes the following two core modules: Focused Multi-Scale Fusion (FMF) Module, which focuses on effectively preserving and fusing image information from different scales with lower computational resource consumption. By precisely regulating the information flow, the FMF module enhances the model adaptability and robustness to scale variations while maintaining image details. Depth-Aware Feature Enhancement Mamba (DMB) Module: It utilizes the fused features from image characteristics as input and employs a novel adaptive strategy to globally integrate depth information and visual information. This depth fusion strategy not only improves the accuracy of depth estimation but also enhances the model performance under different viewing angles and environmental conditions. Moreover, the modular design of MonoMM provides high flexibility and scalability, facilitating adjustments and optimizations according to specific application needs. Extensive experiments conducted on the KITTI dataset show that our method outperforms previous monocular methods and achieves real-time detection.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in pre-trained foundation models for time series forecasting have gained significant interest. However, current methods often overlook the multi-scale nature of time series, which is essential for accurate forecasting. To address this, we propose HiMTM, a hierarchical multi-scale masked time series modeling with self-distillation for long-term forecasting. HiMTM integrates four key components: (1) hierarchical multi-scale transformer (HMT) to capture temporal information at different scales; (2) decoupled encoder-decoder (DED) that directs the encoder towards feature extraction while the decoder focuses on pretext tasks; (3) hierarchical self-distillation (HSD) for multi-stage feature-level supervision signals during pre-training; and (4) cross-scale attention fine-tuning (CSA-FT) to capture dependencies between different scales for downstream tasks. These components collectively enhance multi-scale feature extraction in masked time series modeling, improving forecasting accuracy. Extensive experiments on seven mainstream datasets show that HiMTM surpasses state-of-the-art self-supervised and end-to-end learning methods by a considerable margin of 3.16-68.54\%. Additionally, HiMTM outperforms the latest robust self-supervised learning method, PatchTST, in cross-domain forecasting by a significant margin of 2.3\%. The effectiveness of HiMTM is further demonstrated through its application in natural gas demand forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by CIKM 2024</p></details> |

Indeed, for many applications, the target sound signal and its spatial cues carry important information about the sound source. Binaural TSE can be realized with a neural network trained to output only the desired sound given a binaural mixture and an embedding characterizing the desired sound class as inputs. Conventional TSE systems are trained using signal-level losses, which measure the difference between the extracted and reference signals for the left and right channels. In this paper, we propose adding explicit spatial losses to better preserve the spatial cues of the target sound. In particular, we explore losses aiming at preserving the interaural level (ILD), phase (IPD), and time differences (ITD). We show experimentally that adding such spatial losses, particularly our newly proposed ITD loss, helps preserve better spatial cues while maintaining the signal-level metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the International Workshop on Acoustic Signal Enhancement (IWAENC 2024)</p></details> |
| **[MAARS: Multi-Rate Attack-Aware Randomized Scheduling for Securing Real-time Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00341v1)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) consist of numerous control units interconnected by communication networks. Each control unit executes multiple safety-critical and non-critical tasks in real-time. Most of the safety-critical tasks are executed with a fixed sampling period to ensure deterministic timing behaviour that helps in its safety and performance analysis. However, adversaries can exploit this deterministic behaviour of safety-critical tasks to launch inference-based-based attacks on them. This paper aims to prevent and minimize the possibility of such timing inference or schedule-based attacks to compromise the control units. This is done by switching between strategically chosen execution rates of the safety-critical control tasks such that their performance remains unhampered. Thereafter, we present a novel schedule vulnerability analysis methodology to switch between valid schedules generated for these multiple periodicities of the control tasks in run time. Utilizing these strategies, we introduce a novel Multi-Rate Attack-Aware Randomized Scheduling (MAARS) framework for preemptive fixed-priority schedulers that minimize the success rate of timing-inference-based attacks on safety-critical real-time systems. To our knowledge, this is the first work to propose a schedule randomization method with attack awareness that preserves both the control and scheduling aspects. The efficacy of the framework in terms of attack prevention is finally evaluated on several automotive benchmarks in a Hardware-in-loop (HiL) environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages including references, Total 10 figures (with 3 having subfigures).

| **[Fast Robust Monitoring for Signal Temporal Logic with Value Freezing Operators (STL*)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02460v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers have previously proposed augmenting Signal Temporal Logic (STL) with the value freezing operator in order to express engineering properties that cannot be expressed in STL. This augmented logic is known as STL*. The previous algorithms for STL* monitoring were intractable, and did not scale formulae with nested freeze variables. We present offline discrete-time monitoring algorithms with an acceleration heuristic, both for Boolean monitoring as well as for quantitative robustness monitoring. The acceleration heuristic operates over time intervals where subformulae hold true, rather than over the original trace sample-points. We present experimental validation of our algorithms, the results show that our algorithms can monitor over long traces for formulae with two or three nested freeze variables. Our work is the first work with monitoring algorithm implementations for STL* formulae with nested freeze variables.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of MEMOCODE 2024 paper</p></details> |

The central aim of multi-agent optimization is for a network of agents to collaboratively solve a system-level optimization problem with local objective functions and node-to-node communication by distributed algorithms. The scalability of such algorithms crucially depends on the complexity of the communication messages, and a number of communication compressors for distributed optimization have recently been proposed in the literature. First of all, we introduce a general spatio-temporal compressor characterized by the stability of the resulting dynamical system along the vector field of the compressor. We show that several important distributed optimization compressors such as the greedy sparsifier, the uniform quantizer, and the scalarizer all fall into the category of this spatio-temporal compressor. Next, we propose two distributed prime-dual flows with the spatio-temporal compressors being applied to local node states and local error states, respectively, and prove (exponential) convergence of the node trajectories to the global optimizer for (strongly) convex cost functions. Finally, a few numerical examples are present to illustrate our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Gaussian Temporal Difference Error For Uncertainty-aware Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02295v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional uncertainty-aware temporal difference (TD) learning methods often rely on simplistic assumptions, typically including a zero-mean Gaussian distribution for TD errors. Such oversimplification can lead to inaccurate error representations and compromised uncertainty estimation. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for generalized Gaussian error modeling in deep reinforcement learning, applicable to both discrete and continuous control settings. Our framework enhances the flexibility of error distribution modeling by incorporating higher-order moments, particularly kurtosis, thereby improving the estimation and mitigation of data-dependent noise, i.e., aleatoric uncertainty. We examine the influence of the shape parameter of the generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) on aleatoric uncertainty and provide a closed-form expression that demonstrates an inverse relationship between uncertainty and the shape parameter. Additionally, we propose a theoretically grounded weighting scheme to fully leverage the GGD. To address epistemic uncertainty, we enhance the batch inverse variance weighting by incorporating bias reduction and kurtosis considerations, resulting in improved robustness. Extensive experimental evaluations using policy gradient algorithms demonstrate the consistent efficacy of our method, showcasing significant performance improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Markov Decision Processes under External Temporal Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16056v2)** | 2024-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most reinforcement learning algorithms treat the context under which they operate as a stationary, isolated, and undisturbed environment. However, in real world applications, environments constantly change due to a variety of external events. To address this problem, we study Markov Decision Processes (MDP) under the influence of an external temporal process. We formalize this notion and discuss conditions under which the problem becomes tractable with suitable solutions. We propose a policy iteration algorithm to solve this problem and theoretically analyze its performance. We derive results on the sample complexity of the algorithm and study its dependency on the extent of non-stationarity of the environment. We then conduct experiments to illustrate our results in a classic control environment.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D Single-object Tracking in Point Clouds with High Temporal Variation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02049v1)** | 2024-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The high temporal variation of the point clouds is the key challenge of 3D single-object tracking (3D SOT). Existing approaches rely on the assumption that the shape variation of the point clouds and the motion of the objects across neighboring frames are smooth, failing to cope with high temporal variation data. In this paper, we present a novel framework for 3D SOT in point clouds with high temporal variation, called HVTrack. HVTrack proposes three novel components to tackle the challenges in the high temporal variation scenario: 1) A Relative-Pose-Aware Memory module to handle temporal point cloud shape variations; 2) a Base-Expansion Feature Cross-Attention module to deal with similar object distractions in expanded search areas; 3) a Contextual Point Guided Self-Attention module for suppressing heavy background noise. We construct a dataset with high temporal variation (KITTI-HV) by setting different frame intervals for sampling in the KITTI dataset. On the KITTI-HV with 5 frame intervals, our HVTrack surpasses the state-of-the-art tracker CXTracker by 11.3%/15.7% in Success/Precision.</p></details> | Accepted by ECCV24 |
| **[Exposure Completing for Temporally Consistent Neural High Dynamic Range Video Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13309v2)** | 2024-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High dynamic range (HDR) video rendering from low dynamic range (LDR) videos where frames are of alternate exposure encounters significant challenges, due to the exposure change and absence at each time stamp. The exposure change and absence make existing methods generate flickering HDR results. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm to render HDR frames via completing the absent exposure information, hence the exposure information is complete and consistent. Our approach involves interpolating neighbor LDR frames in the time dimension to reconstruct LDR frames for the absent exposures. Combining the interpolated and given LDR frames, the complete set of exposure information is available at each time stamp. This benefits the fusing process for HDR results, reducing noise and ghosting artifacts therefore improving temporal consistency. Extensive experimental evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the importance of absent exposure completing in HDR video rendering. The code is available at https://github.com/cuijiahao666/NECHDR.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, accepted by ACM-MM 2024 (poster)</p></details> |
| **[Scalable Signal Temporal Logic Guided Reinforcement Learning via Value Function Space Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01923v1)** | 2024-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of reinforcement learning (RL) and formal methods has emerged as a promising framework for solving long-horizon planning problems. Conventional approaches typically involve abstraction of the state and action spaces and manually created labeling functions or predicates. However, the efficiency of these approaches deteriorates as the tasks become increasingly complex, which results in exponential growth in the size of labeling functions or predicates. To address these issues, we propose a scalable model-based RL framework, called VFSTL, which schedules pre-trained skills to follow unseen STL specifications without using hand-crafted predicates. Given a set of value functions obtained by goal-conditioned RL, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the robustness value of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) defined specifications, which is computed using value functions as predicates. To further reduce the computation burden, we abstract the environment state space into the value function space (VFS). Then the optimization problem is solved by Model-Based Reinforcement Learning. Simulation results show that STL with value functions as predicates approximates the ground truth robustness and the planning in VFS directly achieves unseen specifications using data from sensors.</p></details> |  |
| **[STDA: Spatio-Temporal Dual-Encoder Network Incorporating Driver Attention to Predict Driver Behaviors Under Safety-Critical Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01774v1)** | 2024-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate behavior prediction for vehicles is essential but challenging for autonomous driving. Most existing studies show satisfying performance under regular scenarios, but most neglected safety-critical scenarios. In this study, a spatio-temporal dual-encoder network named STDA for safety-critical scenarios was developed. Considering the exceptional capabilities of human drivers in terms of situational awareness and comprehending risks, driver attention was incorporated into STDA to facilitate swift identification of the critical regions, which is expected to improve both performance and interpretability. STDA contains four parts: the driver attention prediction module, which predicts driver attention; the fusion module designed to fuse the features between driver attention and raw images; the temporary encoder module used to enhance the capability to interpret dynamic scenes; and the behavior prediction module to predict the behavior. The experiment data are used to train and validate the model. The results show that STDA improves the G-mean from 0.659 to 0.719 when incorporating driver attention and adopting a temporal encoder module. In addition, extensive experimentation has been conducted to validate that the proposed module exhibits robust generalization capabilities and can be seamlessly integrated into other mainstream models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Landmark-guided Diffusion Model for High-fidelity and Temporally Coherent Talking Head Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01732v1)** | 2024-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-driven talking head generation is a significant and challenging task applicable to various fields such as virtual avatars, film production, and online conferences. However, the existing GAN-based models emphasize generating well-synchronized lip shapes but overlook the visual quality of generated frames, while diffusion-based models prioritize generating high-quality frames but neglect lip shape matching, resulting in jittery mouth movements. To address the aforementioned problems, we introduce a two-stage diffusion-based model. The first stage involves generating synchronized facial landmarks based on the given speech. In the second stage, these generated landmarks serve as a condition in the denoising process, aiming to optimize mouth jitter issues and generate high-fidelity, well-synchronized, and temporally coherent talking head videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model yields the best performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unveiling land use dynamics: Insights from a hierarchical Bayesian spatio-temporal modelling of Compositional Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21695v2)** | 2024-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Changes in land use patterns have significant environmental and socioeconomic impacts, making it crucial for policymakers to understand their causes and consequences. This study, part of the European LAMASUS (Land Management for Sustainability) project, aims to support the EU's climate neutrality target by developing a governance model through collaboration between policymakers, land users, and researchers. We present a methodological synthesis for treating land use data using a Bayesian approach within spatial and spatio-temporal modeling frameworks. The study tackles the challenges of analyzing land use changes, particularly the presence of zero values and computational issues with large datasets. It introduces joint model structures to address zeros and employs sequential inference and consensus methods for Big Data problems. Spatial downscaling models approximate smaller scales from aggregated data, circumventing high-resolution data complications. We explore Beta regression and Compositional Data Analysis (CoDa) for land use data, review relevant spatial and spatio-temporal models, and present strategies for handling zeros. The paper demonstrates the implementation of key models, downscaling techniques, and solutions to Big Data challenges with examples from simulated data and the LAMASUS project, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding and managing land use changes.</p></details> | 29 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Signal-SGN: A Spiking Graph Convolutional Network for Skeletal Action Recognition via Learning Temporal-Frequency Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01701v1)** | 2024-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In skeletal-based action recognition, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) based methods face limitations due to their complexity and high energy consumption. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained attention in recent years for their low energy consumption, but existing methods combining GCNs and SNNs fail to fully utilize the temporal characteristics of skeletal sequences, leading to increased storage and computational costs. To address this issue, we propose a Signal-SGN(Spiking Graph Convolutional Network), which leverages the temporal dimension of skeletal sequences as the spiking timestep and treats features as discrete stochastic signals. The core of the network consists of a 1D Spiking Graph Convolutional Network (1D-SGN) and a Frequency Spiking Convolutional Network (FSN). The SGN performs graph convolution on single frames and incorporates spiking network characteristics to capture inter-frame temporal relationships, while the FSN uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and complex convolution to extract temporal-frequency features. We also introduce a multi-scale wavelet transform feature fusion module(MWTF) to capture spectral features of temporal signals, enhancing the model's classification capability. We propose a pluggable temporal-frequency spatial semantic feature extraction module(TFSM) to enhance the model's ability to distinguish features without increasing inference-phase consumption. Our numerous experiments on the NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA datasets demonstrate that the proposed models not only surpass existing SNN-based methods in accuracy but also reduce computational and storage costs during training. Furthermore, they achieve competitive accuracy compared to corresponding GCN-based methods, which is quite remarkable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mixed moving average field guided learning for spatio-temporal data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00736v4)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Influenced mixed moving average fields are a versatile modeling class for spatio-temporal data. However, their predictive distribution is not generally known. Under this modeling assumption, we define a novel spatio-temporal embedding and a theory-guided machine learning approach that employs a generalized Bayesian algorithm to make ensemble forecasts. We use Lipschitz predictors and determine fixed-time and any-time PAC Bayesian bounds in the batch learning setting. Performing causal forecast is a highlight of our methodology as its potential application to data with spatial and temporal short and long-range dependence. We then test the performance of our learning methodology by using linear predictors and data sets simulated from a spatio-temporal Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</p></details> |  |
| **[MambaST: A Plug-and-Play Cross-Spectral Spatial-Temporal Fuser for Efficient Pedestrian Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01037v1)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes MambaST, a plug-and-play cross-spectral spatial-temporal fusion pipeline for efficient pedestrian detection. Several challenges exist for pedestrian detection in autonomous driving applications. First, it is difficult to perform accurate detection using RGB cameras under dark or low-light conditions. Cross-spectral systems must be developed to integrate complementary information from multiple sensor modalities, such as thermal and visible cameras, to improve the robustness of the detections. Second, pedestrian detection models are latency-sensitive. Efficient and easy-to-scale detection models with fewer parameters are highly desirable for real-time applications such as autonomous driving. Third, pedestrian video data provides spatial-temporal correlations of pedestrian movement. It is beneficial to incorporate temporal as well as spatial information to enhance pedestrian detection. This work leverages recent advances in the state space model (Mamba) and proposes a novel Multi-head Hierarchical Patching and Aggregation (MHHPA) structure to extract both fine-grained and coarse-grained information from both RGB and thermal imagery. Experimental results show that the proposed MHHPA is an effective and efficient alternative to a Transformer model for cross-spectral pedestrian detection. Our proposed model also achieves superior performance on small-scale pedestrian detection.

| **[SARN: Structurally-Aware Recurrent Network for Spatio-Temporal Disaggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07292v4)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open data is frequently released spatially aggregated, usually to comply with privacy policies. But coarse, heterogeneous aggregations complicate learning and integration for downstream AI/ML systems. In this work, we consider models to disaggregate spatio-temporal data from a low-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., census tract) to a high-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., city block). We propose an overarching model named the Structurally-Aware Recurrent Network (SARN), which integrates structurally-aware spatial attention (SASA) layers into the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model. The spatial attention layers capture spatial interactions among regions, while the gated recurrent module captures the temporal dependencies. Each SASA layer calculates both global and structural attention -- global attention facilitates comprehensive interactions between different geographic levels, while structural attention leverages the containment relationship between different geographic levels (e.g., a city block being wholly contained within a census tract) to ensure coherent and consistent results. For scenarios with limited historical training data, we explore transfer learning and show that a model pre-trained on one city variable can be fine-tuned for another city variable using only a few hundred samples. Evaluating these techniques on two mobility datasets, we find that on both datasets, SARN significantly outperforms other neural models (5% and 1%) and typical heuristic methods (40% and 14%), enabling us to generate realistic, high-quality fine-grained data for downstream applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthesis of Temporal Causality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10912v2)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an automata-based algorithm to synthesize omega-regular causes for omega-regular effects on executions of a reactive system, such as counterexamples uncovered by a model checker. Our theory is a generalization of temporal causality, which has recently been proposed as a framework for drawing causal relationships between trace properties on a given trace. So far, algorithms exist only for verifying a single causal relationship and, as an extension, cause synthesis through enumeration, which is complete only for a small fragment of effect properties. This work presents the first complete cause-synthesis algorithm for the class of omega-regular effects. We show that in this case, causes are guaranteed to be omega-regular themselves and can be computed as, e.g., nondeterministic B\"uchi automata. We demonstrate the practical feasibility of this algorithm with a prototype tool and evaluate its performance for cause synthesis and cause checking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version with appendix</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Transfer Learning for Traffic Optimization with Coarse-grained Advisory Autonomy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09436v2)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development of connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technologies has spurred investigations to optimize dense urban traffic to maximize vehicle speed and throughput. This paper explores advisory autonomy, in which real-time driving advisories are issued to the human drivers, thus achieving near-term performance of automated vehicles. Due to the complexity of traffic systems, recent studies of coordinating CAVs have resorted to leveraging deep reinforcement learning (RL). Coarse-grained advisory is formalized as zero-order holds, and we consider a range of hold duration from 0.1 to 40 seconds. However, despite the similarity of the higher frequency tasks on CAVs, a direct application of deep RL fails to be generalized to advisory autonomy tasks. To overcome this, we utilize zero-shot transfer, training policies on a set of source tasks--specific traffic scenarios with designated hold durations--and then evaluating the efficacy of these policies on different target tasks. We introduce Temporal Transfer Learning (TTL) algorithms to select source tasks for zero-shot transfer, systematically leveraging the temporal structure to solve the full range of tasks. TTL selects the most suitable source tasks to maximize the performance of the range of tasks. We validate our algorithms on diverse mixed-traffic scenarios, demonstrating that TTL more reliably solves the tasks than baselines. This paper underscores the potential of coarse-grained advisory autonomy with TTL in traffic flow optimization.</p></details> | 18 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Temporal Evolution of Knee Osteoarthritis: A Diffusion-based Morphing Model for X-ray Medical Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00891v1)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common musculoskeletal disorder that significantly affects the mobility of older adults. In the medical domain, images containing temporal data are frequently utilized to study temporal dynamics and statistically monitor disease progression. While deep learning-based generative models for natural images have been widely researched, there are comparatively few methods available for synthesizing temporal knee X-rays. In this work, we introduce a novel deep-learning model designed to synthesize intermediate X-ray images between a specific patient's healthy knee and severe KOA stages. During the testing phase, based on a healthy knee X-ray, the proposed model can produce a continuous and effective sequence of KOA X-ray images with varying degrees of severity. Specifically, we introduce a Diffusion-based Morphing Model by modifying the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model. Our approach integrates diffusion and morphing modules, enabling the model to capture spatial morphing details between source and target knee X-ray images and synthesize intermediate frames along a geodesic path. A hybrid loss consisting of diffusion loss, morphing loss, and supervision loss was employed. We demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves the highest temporal frame synthesis performance, effectively augmenting data for classification models and simulating the progression of KOA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Detection of Anomalies in Temporal Knowledge Graphs with Interpretability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00872v1)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) are valuable resources for capturing evolving relationships among entities, yet they are often plagued by noise, necessitating robust anomaly detection mechanisms. Existing dynamic graph anomaly detection approaches struggle to capture the rich semantics introduced by node and edge categories within TKGs, while TKG embedding methods lack interpretability, undermining the credibility of anomaly detection. Moreover, these methods falter in adapting to pattern changes and semantic drifts resulting from knowledge updates. To tackle these challenges, we introduce AnoT, an efficient TKG summarization method tailored for interpretable online anomaly detection in TKGs. AnoT begins by summarizing a TKG into a novel rule graph, enabling flexible inference of complex patterns in TKGs. When new knowledge emerges, AnoT maps it onto a node in the rule graph and traverses the rule graph recursively to derive the anomaly score of the knowledge. The traversal yields reachable nodes that furnish interpretable evidence for the validity or the anomalous of the new knowledge. Overall, AnoT embodies a detector-updater-monitor architecture, encompassing a detector for offline TKG summarization and online scoring, an updater for real-time rule graph updates based on emerging knowledge, and a monitor for estimating the approximation error of the rule graph. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate that AnoT surpasses existing methods significantly in terms of accuracy and interoperability. All of the raw datasets and the implementation of AnoT are provided in https://github.com/zjs123/ANoT.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Temporally Disentangled Representation Learning under Unknown Nonstationarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18615v2)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In unsupervised causal representation learning for sequential data with time-delayed latent causal influences, strong identifiability results for the disentanglement of causally-related latent variables have been established in stationary settings by leveraging temporal structure. However, in nonstationary setting, existing work only partially addressed the problem by either utilizing observed auxiliary variables (e.g., class labels and/or domain indexes) as side information or assuming simplified latent causal dynamics. Both constrain the method to a limited range of scenarios. In this study, we further explored the Markov Assumption under time-delayed causally related process in nonstationary setting and showed that under mild conditions, the independent latent components can be recovered from their nonlinear mixture up to a permutation and a component-wise transformation, without the observation of auxiliary variables. We then introduce NCTRL, a principled estimation framework, to reconstruct time-delayed latent causal variables and identify their relations from measured sequential data only. Empirical evaluations demonstrated the reliable identification of time-delayed latent causal influences, with our methodology substantially outperforming existing baselines that fail to exploit the nonstationarity adequately and then, consequently, cannot distinguish distribution shifts.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2023. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2210.13647</p></details> |

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), particularly dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC), has emerged as an important biomarker for AD. Nevertheless, studies probing at-risk subjects in the pre-symptomatic stage using dFNC are limited. To identify at-risk subjects and understand alterations of dFNC in different stages, we leverage deep learning advancements and introduce a transformer-convolution framework for predicting at-risk subjects based on dFNC, incorporating spatial-temporal self-attention to capture brain network dependencies and temporal dynamics. Our model significantly outperforms other popular machine learning methods. By analyzing individuals with diagnosed AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), we studied the AD progression and observed a higher similarity between MCI and asymptomatic AD. The interpretable analysis highlights the cognitive-control network's diagnostic importance, with the model focusing on intra-visual domain dFNC when predicting asymptomatic AD subjects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMBC 2024</p></details> |

While SNNs show promising efficiency on specialized sparse-computational hardware, their practical training often relies on conventional GPUs. This reliance frequently leads to extended computation times when contrasted with traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), presenting significant hurdles for advancing SNN research. To navigate this challenge, we present a novel temporal fusion method, specifically designed to expedite the propagation dynamics of SNNs on GPU platforms, which serves as an enhancement to the current significant approaches for handling deep learning tasks with SNNs. This method underwent thorough validation through extensive experiments in both authentic training scenarios and idealized conditions, confirming its efficacy and adaptability for single and multi-GPU systems. Benchmarked against various existing SNN libraries/implementations, our method achieved accelerations ranging from $5\times$ to $40\times$ on NVIDIA A100 GPUs.

MOSCITO groups those timesteps of a molecular dynamics trajectory together into clusters in which the molecule has similar conformations. In contrast to state-of-the-art methods, MOSCITO takes advantage of sequential relationships found in time series data. Unlike existing work, MOSCITO does not need a two-step procedure with tedious post-processing, but directly models essential properties of the data. Interpreting clusters as Markov states allows us to evaluate the clustering performance based on the resulting Markov state models. In experiments on 60 trajectories and 4 different proteins, we show that the performance of MOSCITO achieves state-of-the-art performance in a novel single-step method. Moreover, by modeling temporal aspects, MOSCITO obtains better segmentation of trajectories, especially for small numbers of clusters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a research paper at BIOKDD 2024</p></details> |

Different from conventional approaches that statically estimate fetal brain motions from pairs of images, our method dynamically tracks the rigid movement patterns of the fetal head across temporal and spatial dimensions. Specifically, we first develop an equivariant neural network that efficiently learns rigid motion sequences through low-dimensional spatial representations of images. Subsequently, we learn spatio-temporal representations by incorporating time encoding and self-attention neural network layers. This approach allows for the capture of long-term dependencies of fetal brain motion and addresses alignment errors due to contrast changes and severe motion artifacts. Our model also provides a geometric deformation estimation that properly addresses image distortions among all time frames. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to learn spatial-temporal representations via deep neural networks for fetal motion tracking without data augmentation. We validated our model using real fetal echo-planar images with simulated and real motions. Our method carries significant potential value in accurately measuring, tracking, and correcting fetal motion in fetal MRI sequences.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions (MICCAI) Workshop on Perinatal Imaging, Placental and Preterm Image analysis (PIPPI) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Transformers Learn Temporal Difference Methods for In-Context Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13861v3)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning refers to the learning ability of a model during inference time without adapting its parameters. The input (i.e., prompt) to the model (e.g., transformers) consists of both a context (i.e., instance-label pairs) and a query instance. The model is then able to output a label for the query instance according to the context during inference. A possible explanation for in-context learning is that the forward pass of (linear) transformers implements iterations of gradient descent on the instance-label pairs in the context. In this paper, we prove by construction that transformers can also implement temporal difference (TD) learning in the forward pass, a phenomenon we refer to as in-context TD. We demonstrate the emergence of in-context TD after training the transformer with a multi-task TD algorithm, accompanied by theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we prove that transformers are expressive enough to implement many other policy evaluation algorithms in the forward pass, including residual gradient, TD with eligibility trace, and average-reward TD.</p></details> |  |
| **[STANet: A Novel Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network for Depression Classification with Small and Unbalanced FMRI Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21323v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate diagnosis of depression is crucial for timely implementation of optimal treatments, preventing complications and reducing the risk of suicide. Traditional methods rely on self-report questionnaires and clinical assessment, lacking objective biomarkers. Combining fMRI with artificial intelligence can enhance depression diagnosis by integrating neuroimaging indicators. However, the specificity of fMRI acquisition for depression often results in unbalanced and small datasets, challenging the sensitivity and accuracy of classification models. In this study, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network (STANet) for diagnosing depression by integrating CNN and RNN to capture both temporal and spatial features of brain activity. STANet comprises the following steps:(1) Aggregate spatio-temporal information via ICA. (2) Utilize multi-scale deep convolution to capture detailed features. (3) Balance data using the SMOTE to generate new samples for minority classes. (4) Employ the AFGRU classifier, which combines Fourier transformation with GRU, to capture long-term dependencies, with an adaptive weight assignment mechanism to enhance model generalization. The experimental results demonstrate that STANet achieves superior depression diagnostic performance with 82.38% accuracy and a 90.72% AUC. The STFA module enhances classification by capturing deeper features at multiple scales. The AFGRU classifier, with adaptive weights and stacked GRU, attains higher accuracy and AUC. SMOTE outperforms other oversampling methods. Additionally, spatio-temporal aggregated features achieve better performance compared to using only temporal or spatial features.

This study presents an unprecedented analysis, in terms of breadth, estimating the SIR transmission parameters from incidence data in all 5,570 municipalities in Brazil over 14 years (2010-2023) for both dengue and chikungunya. We describe the Episcanner computational pipeline, developed to estimate these parameters, producing a reusable dataset describing all dengue and chikungunya epidemics that have taken place in this period, in Brazil. The analysis reveals new insights into the climate-epidemic nexus: We identify distinct geographical and temporal patterns of arbovirus disease incidence across Brazil, highlighting how climatic factors like temperature and precipitation influence the timing and intensity of dengue and chikungunya epidemics. The innovative Episcanner tool empowers researchers and public health officials to explore these patterns in detail, facilitating targeted interventions and risk assessments. This research offers a new perspective on the long-term dynamics of climate-driven mosquito-borne diseases and their geographical specificities linked to the effects of global temperature fluctuations such as those captured by the ENSO index.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for peer review</p></details> |
| **[Temporally Grounding Instructional Diagrams in Unconstrained Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12066v3)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the challenging problem of simultaneously localizing a sequence of queries in the form of instructional diagrams in a video. This requires understanding not only the individual queries but also their interrelationships. However, most existing methods focus on grounding one query at a time, ignoring the inherent structures among queries such as the general mutual exclusiveness and the temporal order. Consequently, the predicted timespans of different step diagrams may overlap considerably or violate the temporal order, thus harming the accuracy. In this paper, we tackle this issue by simultaneously grounding a sequence of step diagrams. Specifically, we propose composite queries, constructed by exhaustively pairing up the visual content features of the step diagrams and a fixed number of learnable positional embeddings. Our insight is that self-attention among composite queries carrying different content features suppress each other to reduce timespan overlaps in predictions, while the cross-attention corrects the temporal misalignment via content and position joint guidance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the IAW dataset for grounding step diagrams and the YouCook2 benchmark for grounding natural language queries, significantly outperforming existing methods while simultaneously grounding multiple queries.</p></details> |  |

As a promising area, this paper studies an MTL-based control approach considering Signal Temporal Logic (STL). Task compliance is measured via the Robustness Degree (RD) which is computed by using the STL semantics. A suitable methodology is provided to solve the learning and testing stages, with an appropriate treatment of the non-convex terms in the quadratic objective function and using Sequential Convex Programming based on trust region update. In the learning stage, an ensemble of tasks is generated from deterministic goals to obtain a strong initializer for the testing stage, where related tasks are solved with a larger impact of perturbation. The methodology demonstrates to be robust in two dynamical systems showing results that meet the task specifications in a few shots for the testing stage, even for highly perturbed tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Optimal Signal Temporal Logic Decision Trees for Classification: A Max-Flow MILP Formulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21090v1)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel framework for inferring timed temporal logic properties from data. The dataset comprises pairs of finite-time system traces and corresponding labels, denoting whether the traces demonstrate specific desired behaviors, e.g. whether the ship follows a safe route or not. Our proposed approach leverages decision-tree-based methods to infer Signal Temporal Logic classifiers using primitive formulae. We formulate the inference process as a mixed integer linear programming optimization problem, recursively generating constraints to determine both data classification and tree structure. Applying a max-flow algorithm on the resultant tree transforms the problem into a global optimization challenge, leading to improved classification rates compared to prior methodologies. Moreover, we introduce a technique to reduce the number of constraints by exploiting the symmetry inherent in STL primitives, which enhances the algorithm's time performance and interpretability. To assess our algorithm's effectiveness and classification performance, we conduct three case studies involving two-class, multi-class, and complex formula classification scenarios.</p></details> |  |

These programs are being increasingly asked to provide forest parameter estimates for spatial and temporal extents smaller than their current design and accompanying design-based methods can deliver with desired levels of uncertainty. Many NFI designs and estimation methods focus on status and are not well equipped to provide acceptable estimates for trend and change parameters, especially over small spatial domains and/or short time periods. Fine-scale space-time indexed estimates are critical to a variety of environmental, ecological, and economic monitoring efforts. Estimates for forest carbon status, trend, and change are of particular importance to international initiatives to track carbon dynamics. Model-based small area estimation (SAE) methods for NFI and similar ecological monitoring data typically pursue inference on status within small spatial domains, with few demonstrated methods that account for spatio-temporal dependence needed for trend and change estimation. We propose a spatio-temporal Bayesian model framework that delivers statistically valid estimates with full uncertainty quantification for status, trend, and change. The framework accommodates a variety of space and time dependency structures, and we detail model configurations for different settings. Through analysis of simulated datasets, we compare the relative performance of candidate models and a traditional direct estimator. We then apply candidate models to a large-scale NFI dataset to demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework for providing unique quantification of forest carbon dynamics in the contiguous United States. We also provide computationally efficient algorithms, software, and data to reproduce our results and for benchmarking.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpotFormer: Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Transformer for Facial Expression Spotting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20799v1)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial expression spotting, identifying periods where facial expressions occur in a video, is a significant yet challenging task in facial expression analysis. The issues of irrelevant facial movements and the challenge of detecting subtle motions in micro-expressions remain unresolved, hindering accurate expression spotting. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for facial expression spotting. First, we propose a Sliding Window-based Multi-Resolution Optical flow (SW-MRO) feature, which calculates multi-resolution optical flow of the input image sequence within compact sliding windows. The window length is tailored to perceive complete micro-expressions and distinguish between general macro- and micro-expressions. SW-MRO can effectively reveal subtle motions while avoiding severe head movement problems. Second, we propose SpotFormer, a multi-scale spatio-temporal Transformer that simultaneously encodes spatio-temporal relationships of the SW-MRO features for accurate frame-level probability estimation. In SpotFormer, our proposed Facial Local Graph Pooling (FLGP) and convolutional layers are applied for multi-scale spatio-temporal feature extraction. We show the validity of the architecture of SpotFormer by comparing it with several model variants. Third, we introduce supervised contrastive learning into SpotFormer to enhance the discriminability between different types of expressions. Extensive experiments on SAMM-LV and CAS(ME)^2 show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models, particularly in micro-expression spotting.</p></details> |  |
| **[STUPD: A Synthetic Dataset for Spatial and Temporal Relation Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06680v2)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding relations between objects is crucial for understanding the semantics of a visual scene. It is also an essential step in order to bridge visual and language models. However, current state-of-the-art computer vision models still lack the ability to perform spatial reasoning well. Existing datasets mostly cover a relatively small number of spatial relations, all of which are static relations that do not intrinsically involve motion. In this paper, we propose the Spatial and Temporal Understanding of Prepositions Dataset (STUPD) -- a large-scale video dataset for understanding static and dynamic spatial relationships derived from prepositions of the English language. The dataset contains 150K visual depictions (videos and images), consisting of 30 distinct spatial prepositional senses, in the form of object interaction simulations generated synthetically using Unity3D. In addition to spatial relations, we also propose 50K visual depictions across 10 temporal relations, consisting of videos depicting event/time-point interactions. To our knowledge, no dataset exists that represents temporal relations through visual settings. In this dataset, we also provide 3D information about object interactions such as frame-wise coordinates, and descriptions of the objects used. The goal of this synthetic dataset is to help models perform better in visual relationship detection in real-world settings. We demonstrate an increase in the performance of various models over 2 real-world datasets (ImageNet-VidVRD and Spatial Senses) when pretrained on the STUPD dataset, in comparison to other pretraining datasets.</p></details> |  |

Existing distortion correction solutions often struggle to balance computational complexity and accuracy. In this work, we propose an Adaptive Temporal Interval-based Continuous-Time LiDAR-only Odometry, utilizing straightforward and efficient linear interpolation. Our method flexibly adjusts the temporal intervals between control nodes according to the dynamics of motion and environmental characteristics. This adaptability enhances performance across various motion states and improves robustness in challenging, feature-sparse environments. We validate the effectiveness of our method on multiple datasets across different platforms, achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art LiDAR-only odometry methods. Notably, in scenarios involving aggressive motion and sparse features, our method outperforms existing solutions.</p></details> |  |

Despite this, the application of SNNs in graph representation learning, particularly for non-Euclidean data, remains underexplored, and the influence of spiking dynamics on graph learning is not yet fully understood. This work seeks to address these gaps by examining the unique properties and benefits of spiking dynamics in enhancing graph representation learning. We propose a spike-based graph neural network model that incorporates spiking dynamics, enhanced by a novel spatial-temporal feature normalization (STFN) technique, to improve training efficiency and model stability. Our detailed analysis explores the impact of rate coding and temporal coding on SNN performance, offering new insights into their advantages for deep graph networks and addressing challenges such as the oversmoothing problem. Experimental results demonstrate that our SNN models can achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art graph neural networks (GNNs) while considerably reducing computational costs, highlighting the potential of SNNs for efficient neuromorphic computing applications in complex graph-based scenarios.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we propose FUTGA, a model equipped with fined-grained music understanding capabilities through learning from generative augmentation with temporal compositions. We leverage existing music caption datasets and large language models (LLMs) to synthesize fine-grained music captions with structural descriptions and time boundaries for full-length songs. Augmented by the proposed synthetic dataset, FUTGA is enabled to identify the music's temporal changes at key transition points and their musical functions, as well as generate detailed descriptions for each music segment. We further introduce a full-length music caption dataset generated by FUTGA, as the augmentation of the MusicCaps and the Song Describer datasets. We evaluate the automatically generated captions on several downstream tasks, including music generation and retrieval. The experiments demonstrate the quality of the generated captions and the better performance in various downstream tasks achieved by the proposed music captioning approach.

Recently, machine learning has emerged as an appealing alternative to improve accuracy and reduce computational time. However, due to limited observational technology and high costs, the scarcity of real-world data restricts the potential of machine learning models. To overcome these limitations, we propose an ocean SWH estimation framework, namely Orca. Specifically, Orca enhances the limited spatio-temporal reasoning abilities of classic LLMs with a novel spatiotemporal aware encoding module. By segmenting the limited buoy observational data temporally, encoding the buoys' locations spatially, and designing prompt templates, Orca capitalizes on the robust generalization ability of LLMs to estimate significant wave height effectively with limited data. Experimental results on the Gulf of Mexico demonstrate that Orca achieves state-of-the-art performance in SWH estimation.</p></details> |  |

We formulate our framework within the context of reinforcement learning to pave the way for safety-aware agents. Nevertheless, we assert that our approach could prove beneficial in various contexts, including a safety alert system or analytical purposes. A comprehensive examination of our framework is conducted using a realistic autonomous driving simulator, illustrating its high sample efficiency and reliable prediction capabilities for previously unseen collision events.

After collecting the public posts of around 5000 profiles from Disqus and Twitter, we analyze their posts to match their profiles across the two platforms. We pursue both temporal and non-temporal methods in our analysis. While neither approach proves definitively superior, the temporal approach generally performs better. We found that the temporal window size influences results more than the shifting amount. On the other hand, our sentiment analysis shows that the inclusion of sentiment makes little difference, probably due to flawed data extraction methods. We also experimented with a distance-based reward-and-punishment-focused scoring model, which achieved an accuracy of 24.198% and an average rank of 158.217 out of 2525 in our collected corpus. Future work includes refining sentiment analysis by evaluating sentiments per topic, extending temporal analysis with additional phases, and improving the scoring model through weight adjustments and modified rewards.</p></details> |  |

However, training models for long video generation tasks require significant computational and data resources, posing a challenge to developing long video diffusion models. This paper investigates a straightforward and training-free approach to extend an existing short video diffusion model (e.g. pre-trained on 16-frame videos) for consistent long video generation (e.g. 128 frames). Our preliminary observation has found that directly applying the short video diffusion model to generate long videos can lead to severe video quality degradation. Further investigation reveals that this degradation is primarily due to the distortion of high-frequency components in long videos, characterized by a decrease in spatial high-frequency components and an increase in temporal high-frequency components. Motivated by this, we propose a novel solution named FreeLong to balance the frequency distribution of long video features during the denoising process. FreeLong blends the low-frequency components of global video features, which encapsulate the entire video sequence, with the high-frequency components of local video features that focus on shorter subsequences of frames. This approach maintains global consistency while incorporating diverse and high-quality spatiotemporal details from local videos, enhancing both the consistency and fidelity of long video generation. We evaluated FreeLong on multiple base video diffusion models and observed significant improvements. Additionally, our method supports coherent multi-prompt generation, ensuring both visual coherence and seamless transitions between scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://yulu.net.cn/freelong</p></details> |
| **[Three-Stream Temporal-Shift Attention Network Based on Self-Knowledge Distillation for Micro-Expression Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17538v2)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Micro-expressions are subtle facial movements that occur spontaneously when people try to conceal real emotions. Micro-expression recognition is crucial in many fields, including criminal analysis and psychotherapy. However, micro-expression recognition is challenging since micro-expressions have low intensity and public datasets are small in size. To this end, a three-stream temporal-shift attention network based on self-knowledge distillation called SKD-TSTSAN is proposed in this paper. Firstly, to address the low intensity of muscle movements, we utilize learning-based motion magnification modules to enhance the intensity of muscle movements. Secondly, we employ efficient channel attention modules in the local-spatial stream to make the network focus on facial regions that are highly relevant to micro-expressions. In addition, temporal shift modules are used in the dynamic-temporal stream, which enables temporal modeling with no additional parameters by mixing motion information from two different temporal domains. Furthermore, we introduce self-knowledge distillation into the micro-expression recognition task by introducing auxiliary classifiers and using the deepest section of the network for supervision, encouraging all blocks to fully explore the features of the training set. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on four public datasets: CASME II, SAMM, MMEW, and CAS(ME)3. The experimental results demonstrate that our SKD-TSTSAN outperforms other existing methods and achieves new state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be available at https://github.com/GuanghaoZhu663/SKD-TSTSAN.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advances with transformer-based forecasting models, challenges remain due to the non-stationary, nonlinear characteristics of workload time series and the long-term dependencies. In particular, inconsistent performance between long-term history and near-term forecasts hinders long-range predictions. This paper proposes a novel framework leveraging self-supervised multiscale representation learning to capture both long-term and near-term workload patterns. The long-term history is encoded through multiscale representations while the near-term observations are modeled via temporal flow fusion. These representations of different scales are fused using an attention mechanism and characterized with normalizing flows to handle non-Gaussian/non-linear distributions of time series. Extensive experiments on 9 benchmarks demonstrate superiority over existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 33rd ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM '24), October 21--25, 2024, Boise, ID, USA</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Feature Matters: A Framework for Diffusion Model Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19547v1)** | 2024-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Diffusion models, widely used for image generation, face significant challenges related to their broad applicability due to prolonged inference times and high memory demands. Efficient Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is crucial to address these issues in traditional models. Unlike those models, diffusion models critically rely on the time-step $t$ for effective multi-round denoising. Typically, $t$ from the finite set $\{1, \ldots, T\}$ is encoded into a hypersensitive temporal feature by several modules, entirely independent of the sampling data. However, existing PTQ methods do not optimize these modules individually. Instead, they employ unsuitable reconstruction objectives and complex calibration methods, leading to significant disturbances in the temporal feature and denoising trajectory. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel quantization framework: 1)~TIB-based Maintenance: Based on our innovative Temporal Information Block~(TIB) definition, Temporal Information-aware Reconstruction~(TIAR) and Finite Set Calibration~(FSC) are developed to efficiently align full precision temporal features. 2)~Cache-based Maintenance: Instead of indirect and complex optimization for the related modules, pre-computing and caching quantized counterparts of temporal features are developed to minimize errors. 3)~Disturbance-aware Selection: Employ temporal feature errors to guide a fine-grained selection for superior maintenance. This framework preserves most of the temporal information and ensures high-quality end-to-end generation. Extensive testing on various datasets and diffusion models confirms our superior results. Notably, our approach closely matches the performance of the full-precision model under 4-bit quantization. Furthermore, the quantized SD-XL model achieves hardware acceleration of 2.20$\times$ on CPU and 5.76$\times$ on GPU demonstrating its efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2311.16503</p></details> |

Existing solutions primarily rely on the RGB modality, which encounters challenges such as background variations, occlusions, motion blurs, and significant computational overhead. Meanwhile, current keypoint-based methods offer a lightweight and informative representation of human motions but necessitate accurate individual annotations and specialized interaction reasoning modules. To address these limitations, we design a panoramic graph that incorporates multi-person skeletons and objects to encapsulate group activity, offering an effective alternative to RGB video. This panoramic graph enables Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to unify intra-person, inter-person, and person-object interactive modeling through spatial-temporal graph convolutions. In practice, we develop a novel pipeline that extracts skeleton coordinates using pose estimation and tracking algorithms and employ Multi-person Panoramic GCN (MP-GCN) to predict group activities. Extensive experiments on Volleyball and NBA datasets demonstrate that the MP-GCN achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and efficiency. Notably, our method outperforms RGB-based approaches by using only estimated 2D keypoints as input. Code is available at https://github.com/mgiant/MP-GCN</p></details> |  |

However, due to the unpredictability of future events, this task is highly challenging. To address this issue, we propose a multi-scale hybrid architecture model based on ensemble learning, called RLGNet (Repeating-Local-Global History Network). Inspired by the application of multi-scale information in other fields, we introduce the concept of multi-scale information into TKG reasoning. Specifically, RLGNet captures and integrates different levels of historical information by combining modules that process information at various scales. The model comprises three modules: the Repeating History Module focuses on identifying repetitive patterns and trends in historical data, the Local History Module captures short-term changes and details, and the Global History Module provides a macro perspective on long-term changes. Additionally, to address the limitations of previous single-architecture models in generalizing across single-step and multi-step reasoning tasks, we adopted architectures based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) for the Local and Global History Modules, respectively. This hybrid architecture design enables the model to complement both multi-step and single-step reasoning capabilities. Finally, to address the issue of noise in TKGs, we adopt an ensemble learning strategy, combining the predictions of the three modules to reduce the impact of noise on the final prediction results. In the evaluation on six benchmark datasets, our approach generally outperforms existing TKG reasoning models in multi-step and single-step reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

This leads to the rising necessity for comprehensive studies to fully understand LLMs and reveal their potential opportunities, drawbacks, and overall societal impact. With that in mind, this research conducted an extensive investigation into seven LLM's, aiming to assess the temporal stability and inter-rater agreement on their responses on personality instruments in two time points. In addition, LLMs personality profile was analyzed and compared to human normative data. The findings revealed varying levels of inter-rater agreement in the LLMs responses over a short time, with some LLMs showing higher agreement (e.g., LIama3 and GPT-4o) compared to others (e.g., GPT-4 and Gemini). Furthermore, agreement depended on used instruments as well as on domain or trait. This implies the variable robustness in LLMs' ability to reliably simulate stable personality characteristics. In the case of scales which showed at least fair agreement, LLMs displayed mostly a socially desirable profile in both agentic and communal domains, as well as a prosocial personality profile reflected in higher agreeableness and conscientiousness and lower Machiavellianism. Exhibiting temporal stability and coherent responses on personality traits is crucial for AI systems due to their societal impact and AI safety concerns.</p></details> | 21 pages, 1 table |

Our findings indicate that CLIP embeddings, while crucial for aesthetic quality, do not significantly contribute towards the subject and background consistency of video outputs. Moreover, the computationally expensive cross-attention mechanism can be effectively replaced by a simpler linear layer. This layer is computed only once at the first diffusion inference step, and its output is then cached and reused throughout the inference process, thereby enhancing efficiency while maintaining high-quality outputs. Building on these insights, we introduce the VCUT, a training-free approach optimized for efficiency within the SVD architecture. VCUT eliminates temporal cross-attention and replaces spatial cross-attention with a one-time computed linear layer, significantly reducing computational load. The implementation of VCUT leads to a reduction of up to 322T Multiple-Accumulate Operations (MACs) per video and a decrease in model parameters by up to 50M, achieving a 20% reduction in latency compared to the baseline. Our approach demonstrates that conditioning during the Semantic Binding stage is sufficient, eliminating the need for continuous computation across all inference steps and setting a new standard for efficient video generation.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing techniques that take multiple manual steps to derive standardized skeleton representations as model input, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Mesh Transformer (STMT) to directly model the mesh sequences. The model uses a hierarchical transformer with intra-frame off-set attention and inter-frame self-attention. The attention mechanism allows the model to freely attend between any two vertex patches to learn non-local relationships in the spatial-temporal domain. Masked vertex modeling and future frame prediction are used as two self-supervised tasks to fully activate the bi-directional and auto-regressive attention in our hierarchical transformer. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to skeleton-based and point-cloud-based models on common MoCap benchmarks.

Within a discourse, event pairs are situated at different distances or the so-called proximity bands. The temporal ordering communicated about event pairs where at more remote (i.e., ``long'') or less remote (i.e., ``short'') proximity bands are encoded differently. SOTA models have tended to perform well on events situated at either short or long proximity bands, but not both. Nonetheless, real-world, natural texts contain all types of temporal event-pairs.

| **[The Role of Temporal Hierarchy in Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18838v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have the potential for rich spatio-temporal signal processing thanks to exploiting both spatial and temporal parameters. The temporal dynamics such as time constants of the synapses and neurons and delays have been recently shown to have computational benefits that help reduce the overall number of parameters required in the network and increase the accuracy of the SNNs in solving temporal tasks. Optimizing such temporal parameters, for example, through gradient descent, gives rise to a temporal architecture for different problems. As has been shown in machine learning, to reduce the cost of optimization, architectural biases can be applied, in this case in the temporal domain. Such inductive biases in temporal parameters have been found in neuroscience studies, highlighting a hierarchy of temporal structure and input representation in different layers of the cortex. Motivated by this, we propose to impose a hierarchy of temporal representation in the hidden layers of SNNs, highlighting that such an inductive bias improves their performance. We demonstrate the positive effects of temporal hierarchy in the time constants of feed-forward SNNs applied to temporal tasks (Multi-Time-Scale XOR and Keyword Spotting, with a benefit of up to 4.1% in classification accuracy). Moreover, we show that such architectural biases, i.e. hierarchy of time constants, naturally emerge when optimizing the time constants through gradient descent, initialized as homogeneous values. We further pursue this proposal in temporal convolutional SNNs, by introducing the hierarchical bias in the size and dilation of temporal kernels, giving rise to competitive results in popular temporal spike-based datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, pre-print</p></details> |
| **[Graph Neural Networks for Virtual Sensing in Complex Systems: Addressing Heterogeneous Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18691v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time condition monitoring is crucial for the reliable and efficient operation of complex systems. However, relying solely on physical sensors can be limited due to their cost, placement constraints, or inability to directly measure certain critical parameters. Virtual sensing addresses these limitations by leveraging readily available sensor data and system knowledge to estimate inaccessible parameters or infer system states. The increasing complexity of industrial systems necessitates deployments of sensors with diverse modalities to provide a comprehensive understanding of system states. These sensors capture data at varying frequencies to monitor both rapid and slowly varying system dynamics, as well as local and global state evolutions of the systems. This leads to heterogeneous temporal dynamics, which, particularly under varying operational end environmental conditions, pose a significant challenge for accurate virtual sensing. To address this, we propose a Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural Network (HTGNN) framework. HTGNN explicitly models signals from diverse sensors and integrates operating conditions into the model architecture. We evaluate HTGNN using two newly released datasets: a bearing dataset with diverse load conditions for bearing load prediction and a year-long simulated dataset for predicting bridge live loads. Our results demonstrate that HTGNN significantly outperforms established baseline methods in both tasks, particularly under highly varying operating conditions. These results highlight HTGNN's potential as a robust and accurate virtual sensing approach for complex systems, paving the way for improved monitoring, predictive maintenance, and enhanced system performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper extends our previous conference paper (Best Paper at European Conference of the PHM Society 2024, https://doi.org/10.36001/phme.2024.v8i1.3998)</p></details> |

However, sampling speed has traditionally not been a priority due to their popularity for image generation, limiting their application to dynamical tasks. While recent work has improved the sampling speed of diffusion-based robotic policies, they are restricted to techniques from the image generation domain. We adapt Temporally Entangled Diffusion (TEDi), a framework specific for trajectory generation, to speed up diffusion-based policies for imitation learning. We introduce TEDi Policy, with novel regimes for training and sampling, and show that it drastically improves the sampling speed while remaining performant when applied to state-of-the-art diffusion-based imitation learning policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Temporal Approach for High-Resolution Gridded Wind Forecasting across Southwest Western Australia](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20283v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate wind speed and direction forecasting is paramount across many sectors, spanning agriculture, renewable energy generation, and bushfire management. However, conventional forecasting models encounter significant challenges in precisely predicting wind conditions at high spatial resolutions for individual locations or small geographical areas (< 20 km2) and capturing medium to long-range temporal trends and comprehensive spatio-temporal patterns. This study focuses on a spatial temporal approach for high-resolution gridded wind forecasting at the height of 3 and 10 metres across large areas of the Southwest of Western Australia to overcome these challenges. The model utilises the data that covers a broad geographic area and harnesses a diverse array of meteorological factors, including terrain characteristics, air pressure, 10-metre wind forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, and limited observation data from sparsely distributed weather stations (such as 3-metre wind profiles, humidity, and temperature), the model demonstrates promising advancements in wind forecasting accuracy and reliability across the entire region of interest. This paper shows the potential of our machine learning model for wind forecasts across various prediction horizons and spatial coverage. It can help facilitate more informed decision-making and enhance resilience across critical sectors.</p></details> |  |
| **[TCGPN: Temporal-Correlation Graph Pre-trained Network for Stock Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18519v1)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the incorporation of both temporal features and the correlation across time series has become an effective approach in time series prediction. Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) demonstrate good performance on many Temporal-correlation Forecasting Problem. However, when applied to tasks lacking periodicity, such as stock data prediction, the effectiveness and robustness of STGNNs are found to be unsatisfactory. And STGNNs are limited by memory savings so that cannot handle problems with a large number of nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called the Temporal-Correlation Graph Pre-trained Network (TCGPN) to address these limitations. TCGPN utilize Temporal-correlation fusion encoder to get a mixed representation and pre-training method with carefully designed temporal and correlation pre-training tasks. Entire structure is independent of the number and order of nodes, so better results can be obtained through various data enhancements. And memory consumption during training can be significantly reduced through multiple sampling. Experiments are conducted on real stock market data sets CSI300 and CSI500 that exhibit minimal periodicity. We fine-tune a simple MLP in downstream tasks and achieve state-of-the-art results, validating the capability to capture more robust temporal correlation patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing Temporal Causality for Advanced Temporal Action Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17792v2)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a fundamental task in long-form video understanding, temporal action detection (TAD) aims to capture inherent temporal relations in untrimmed videos and identify candidate actions with precise boundaries. Over the years, various networks, including convolutions, graphs, and transformers, have been explored for effective temporal modeling for TAD. However, these modules typically treat past and future information equally, overlooking the crucial fact that changes in action boundaries are essentially causal events. Inspired by this insight, we propose leveraging the temporal causality of actions to enhance TAD representation by restricting the model's access to only past or future context. We introduce CausalTAD, which combines causal attention and causal Mamba to achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Notably, with CausalTAD, we ranked 1st in the Action Recognition, Action Detection, and Audio-Based Interaction Detection tracks at the EPIC-Kitchens Challenge 2024, as well as 1st in the Moment Queries track at the Ego4D Challenge 2024.

| **[Causal Deepsets for Off-policy Evaluation under Spatial or Spatio-temporal Interferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17910v1)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is widely applied in sectors such as pharmaceuticals and e-commerce to evaluate the efficacy of novel products or policies from offline datasets. This paper introduces a causal deepset framework that relaxes several key structural assumptions, primarily the mean-field assumption, prevalent in existing OPE methodologies that handle spatio-temporal interference. These traditional assumptions frequently prove inadequate in real-world settings, thereby restricting the capability of current OPE methods to effectively address complex interference effects. In response, we advocate for the implementation of the permutation invariance (PI) assumption. This innovative approach enables the data-driven, adaptive learning of the mean-field function, offering a more flexible estimation method beyond conventional averaging. Furthermore, we present novel algorithms that incorporate the PI assumption into OPE and thoroughly examine their theoretical foundations. Our numerical analyses demonstrate that this novel approach yields significantly more precise estimations than existing baseline algorithms, thereby substantially improving the practical applicability and effectiveness of OPE methodologies. A Python implementation of our proposed method is available at https://github.com/BIG-S2/Causal-Deepsets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reliable Spatial-Temporal Voxels For Multi-Modal Test-Time Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06461v3)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal test-time adaptation (MM-TTA) is proposed to adapt models to an unlabeled target domain by leveraging the complementary multi-modal inputs in an online manner. Previous MM-TTA methods for 3D segmentation rely on predictions of cross-modal information in each input frame, while they ignore the fact that predictions of geometric neighborhoods within consecutive frames are highly correlated, leading to unstable predictions across time. To fulfill this gap, we propose ReLiable Spatial-temporal Voxels (Latte), an MM-TTA method that leverages reliable cross-modal spatial-temporal correspondences for multi-modal 3D segmentation. Motivated by the fact that reliable predictions should be consistent with their spatial-temporal correspondences, Latte aggregates consecutive frames in a slide window manner and constructs Spatial-Temopral (ST) voxels to capture temporally local prediction consistency for each modality. After filtering out ST voxels with high ST entropy, Latte conducts cross-modal learning for each point and pixel by attending to those with reliable and consistent predictions among both spatial and temporal neighborhoods. Experimental results show that Latte achieves state-of-the-art performance on three different MM-TTA benchmarks compared to previous MM-TTA or TTA methods.

| **[Spatial-Temporal Cross-View Contrastive Pre-training for Check-in Sequence Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15899v3)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of location-based services (LBS) has yielded massive amounts of data on human mobility. Effectively extracting meaningful representations for user-generated check-in sequences is pivotal for facilitating various downstream services. However, the user-generated check-in data are simultaneously influenced by the surrounding objective circumstances and the user's subjective intention. Specifically, the temporal uncertainty and spatial diversity exhibited in check-in data make it difficult to capture the macroscopic spatial-temporal patterns of users and to understand the semantics of user mobility activities. Furthermore, the distinct characteristics of the temporal and spatial information in check-in sequences call for an effective fusion method to incorporate these two types of information. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Cross-view Contrastive Representation (STCCR) framework for check-in sequence representation learning. Specifically, STCCR addresses the above challenges by employing self-supervision from "spatial topic" and "temporal intention" views, facilitating effective fusion of spatial and temporal information at the semantic level. Besides, STCCR leverages contrastive clustering to uncover users' shared spatial topics from diverse mobility activities, while employing angular momentum contrast to mitigate the impact of temporal uncertainty and noise. We extensively evaluate STCCR on three real-world datasets and demonstrate its superior performance across three downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted as a regular paper at IEEE TKDE</p></details> |
| **[CRASH: Crash Recognition and Anticipation System Harnessing with Context-Aware and Temporal Focus Attentions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17757v1)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately and promptly predicting accidents among surrounding traffic agents from camera footage is crucial for the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs). This task presents substantial challenges stemming from the unpredictable nature of traffic accidents, their long-tail distribution, the intricacies of traffic scene dynamics, and the inherently constrained field of vision of onboard cameras. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel accident anticipation framework for AVs, termed CRASH. It seamlessly integrates five components: object detector, feature extractor, object-aware module, context-aware module, and multi-layer fusion. Specifically, we develop the object-aware module to prioritize high-risk objects in complex and ambiguous environments by calculating the spatial-temporal relationships between traffic agents. In parallel, the context-aware is also devised to extend global visual information from the temporal to the frequency domain using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and capture fine-grained visual features of potential objects and broader context cues within traffic scenes. To capture a wider range of visual cues, we further propose a multi-layer fusion that dynamically computes the temporal dependencies between different scenes and iteratively updates the correlations between different visual features for accurate and timely accident prediction. Evaluated on real-world datasets--Dashcam Accident Dataset (DAD), Car Crash Dataset (CCD), and AnAn Accident Detection (A3D) datasets--our model surpasses existing top baselines in critical evaluation metrics like Average Precision (AP) and mean Time-To-Accident (mTTA). Importantly, its robustness and adaptability are particularly evident in challenging driving scenarios with missing or limited training data, demonstrating significant potential for application in real-world autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |

While increasing biomedical tasks have employed state-of-the-art language models, there are very few studies have examined temporal effects on biomedical models when data usually shifts across development and deployment. This study fills the gap by statistically probing relations between language model performance and data shifts across three biomedical tasks. We deploy diverse metrics to evaluate model performance, distance methods to measure data drifts, and statistical methods to quantify temporal effects on biomedical language models. Our study shows that time matters for deploying biomedical language models, while the degree of performance degradation varies by biomedical tasks and statistical quantification approaches. We believe this study can establish a solid benchmark to evaluate and assess temporal effects on deploying biomedical language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept to AMIA 2024 Annual Symposium</p></details> |
| **[Towards Adaptive Pseudo-label Learning for Semi-Supervised Temporal Action Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07673v3)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alleviating noisy pseudo labels remains a key challenge in Semi-Supervised Temporal Action Localization (SS-TAL). Existing methods often filter pseudo labels based on strict conditions, but they typically assess classification and localization quality separately, leading to suboptimal pseudo-label ranking and selection. In particular, there might be inaccurate pseudo labels within selected positives, alongside reliable counterparts erroneously assigned to negatives. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Adaptive Pseudo-label Learning (APL) framework to facilitate better pseudo-label selection. Specifically, to improve the ranking quality, Adaptive Label Quality Assessment (ALQA) is proposed to jointly learn classification confidence and localization reliability, followed by dynamically selecting pseudo labels based on the joint score. Additionally, we propose an Instance-level Consistency Discriminator (ICD) for eliminating ambiguous positives and mining potential positives simultaneously based on inter-instance intrinsic consistency, thereby leading to a more precise selection. We further introduce a general unsupervised Action-aware Contrastive Pre-training (ACP) to enhance the discrimination both within actions and between actions and backgrounds, which benefits SS-TAL. Extensive experiments on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet v1.3 demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under various semi-supervised settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECCV 2024</p></details> |

BlueTempNet integrates multiple types of networks into a single multi-network, including user-to-user interactions (following and blocking users) and user-to-community interactions (creating and joining communities). Communities are user-formed groups in custom Feeds, where users subscribe to posts aligned with their interests. Following Bluesky's public data policy, we collect existing Bluesky Feeds, including the users who liked and generated these Feeds, and provide tools to gather users' social interactions within a date range.

It captures photons at each pixel independently, creating binary spike streams rich in temporal information but challenging for image reconstruction. Current algorithms, both traditional and deep learning-based, still need to be improved in the utilization of the rich temporal detail and the restoration of the details of the reconstructed image. To overcome this, we introduce Swin Spikeformer (SwinSF), a novel model for dynamic scene reconstruction from spike streams. SwinSF is composed of Spike Feature Extraction, Spatial-Temporal Feature Extraction, and Final Reconstruction Module. It combines shifted window self-attention and proposed temporal spike attention, ensuring a comprehensive feature extraction that encapsulates both spatial and temporal dynamics, leading to a more robust and accurate reconstruction of spike streams. Furthermore, we build a new synthesized dataset for spike image reconstruction which matches the resolution of the latest spike camera, ensuring its relevance and applicability to the latest developments in spike camera imaging. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network SwinSF sets a new benchmark, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a series of datasets, including both real-world and synthesized data across various resolutions. Our codes and proposed dataset will be available soon.</p></details> |  |

Existing temporal representations have progressed from BEV or PV features to more compact query features. Compared to these aforementioned features, predictions offer the highest level of abstraction, providing explicit information. In the context of online vectorized HD map construction, this unique characteristic of predictions is potentially advantageous for long-term temporal modeling and the integration of map priors. This paper introduces PrevPredMap, a pioneering temporal modeling framework that leverages previous predictions for constructing online vectorized HD maps. We have meticulously crafted two essential modules for PrevPredMap: the previous-predictions-based query generator and the dynamic-position-query decoder. Specifically, the previous-predictions-based query generator is designed to separately encode different types of information from previous predictions, which are then effectively utilized by the dynamic-position-query decoder to generate current predictions. Furthermore, we have developed a dual-mode strategy to ensure PrevPredMap's robust performance across both single-frame and temporal modes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PrevPredMap achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets. Code will be available at https://github.com/pnnnnnnn/PrevPredMap.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Splitting of Reusable Temporal Monitors for Rare Traffic Violations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15771v2)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are often tested in simulation to estimate the probability they will violate safety specifications. Two common issues arise when using existing techniques to produce this estimation: If violations occur rarely, simple Monte-Carlo sampling techniques can fail to produce efficient estimates; if simulation horizons are too long, importance sampling techniques (which learn proposal distributions from past simulations) can fail to converge. This paper addresses both issues by interleaving rare-event sampling techniques with online specification monitoring algorithms. We use adaptive multi-level splitting to decompose simulations into partial trajectories, then calculate the distance of those partial trajectories to failure by leveraging robustness metrics from Signal Temporal Logic (STL). By caching those partial robustness metric values, we can efficiently re-use computations across multiple sampling stages. Our experiments on an interstate lane-change scenario show our method is viable for testing simulated AV-pipelines, efficiently estimating failure probabilities for STL specifications based on real traffic rules. We produce better estimates than Monte-Carlo and importance sampling in fewer simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable Artificial Intelligence Techniques for Irregular Temporal Classification of Multidrug Resistance Acquisition in Intensive Care Unit Patients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17165v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Antimicrobial Resistance represents a significant challenge in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), where patients are at heightened risk of Multidrug-Resistant (MDR) infections-pathogens resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents. This study introduces a novel methodology that integrates Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) with advanced intrinsic and post-hoc interpretability techniques for detecting the onset of MDR in patients across time. Within interpretability methods, we propose Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approaches to handle irregular Multivariate Time Series (MTS), introducing Irregular Time Shapley Additive Explanations (IT-SHAP), a modification of Shapley Additive Explanations designed for irregular MTS with Recurrent Neural Networks focused on temporal outputs. Our methodology aims to identify specific risk factors associated with MDR in ICU patients. GRU with Hadamard's attention demonstrated high initial specificity and increasing sensitivity over time, correlating with increased nosocomial infection risks during prolonged ICU stays. XAI analysis, enhanced by Hadamard attention and IT-SHAP, identified critical factors such as previous non-resistant cultures, specific antibiotic usage patterns, and hospital environment dynamics. These insights suggest that early detection of at-risk patients can inform interventions such as preventive isolation and customized treatments, significantly improving clinical outcomes. The proposed GRU model for temporal classification achieved an average Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve of 78.27 +- 1.26 over time, indicating strong predictive performance. In summary, this study highlights the clinical utility of our methodology, which combines predictive accuracy with interpretability, thereby facilitating more effective healthcare interventions by professionals.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOAP: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Relation and Motion Information Capturing for Few-Shot Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16344v2)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High frame-rate (HFR) videos of action recognition improve fine-grained expression while reducing the spatio-temporal relation and motion information density. Thus, large amounts of video samples are continuously required for traditional data-driven training. However, samples are not always sufficient in real-world scenarios, promoting few-shot action recognition (FSAR) research. We observe that most recent FSAR works build spatio-temporal relation of video samples via temporal alignment after spatial feature extraction, cutting apart spatial and temporal features within samples. They also capture motion information via narrow perspectives between adjacent frames without considering density, leading to insufficient motion information capturing. Therefore, we propose a novel plug-and-play architecture for FSAR called Spatio-tempOral frAme tuPle enhancer (SOAP) in this paper. The model we designed with such architecture refers to SOAP-Net. Temporal connections between different feature channels and spatio-temporal relation of features are considered instead of simple feature extraction. Comprehensive motion information is also captured, using frame tuples with multiple frames containing more motion information than adjacent frames. Combining frame tuples of diverse frame counts further provides a broader perspective. SOAP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance across well-known benchmarks such as SthSthV2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51. Extensive empirical evaluations underscore the competitiveness, pluggability, generalization, and robustness of SOAP.

The dataset, OVR (pronounced as over), contains annotations for over 72K videos, with each annotation specifying the number of repetitions, the start and end time of the repetitions, and also a free-form description of what is repeating. The annotations are provided for videos sourced from Kinetics and Ego4D, and consequently cover both Exo and Ego viewing conditions, with a huge variety of actions and activities. Moreover, OVR is almost an order of magnitude larger than previous datasets for video repetition. We also propose a baseline transformer-based counting model, OVRCounter, that can localise and count repetitions in videos that are up to 320 frames long. The model is trained and evaluated on the OVR dataset, and its performance assessed with and without using text to specify the target class to count. The performance is also compared to a prior repetition counting model. The dataset is available for download at: https://sites.google.com/view/openvocabreps/</p></details> |  |
| **[Curriculum Negative Mining For Temporal Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17070v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal networks are effective in capturing the evolving interactions of networks over time, such as social networks and e-commerce networks. In recent years, researchers have primarily concentrated on developing specific model architectures for Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) in order to improve the representation quality of temporal nodes and edges. However, limited attention has been given to the quality of negative samples during the training of TGNNs. When compared with static networks, temporal networks present two specific challenges for negative sampling: positive sparsity and positive shift. Positive sparsity refers to the presence of a single positive sample amidst numerous negative samples at each timestamp, while positive shift relates to the variations in positive samples across different timestamps. To robustly address these challenges in training TGNNs, we introduce Curriculum Negative Mining (CurNM), a model-aware curriculum learning framework that adaptively adjusts the difficulty of negative samples. Within this framework, we first establish a dynamically updated negative pool that balances random, historical, and hard negatives to address the challenges posed by positive sparsity. Secondly, we implement a temporal-aware negative selection module that focuses on learning from the disentangled factors of recently active edges, thus accurately capturing shifting preferences. Extensive experiments on 12 datasets and 3 TGNNs demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline methods by a significant margin. Additionally, thorough ablation studies and parameter sensitivity experiments verify the usefulness and robustness of our approach. Our code is available at https://github.com/zziyue83/CurNM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Temporal Sentence Grounding in Videos with Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03725v2)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Sentence Grounding in Videos (TSGV) aims to detect the event timestamps described by the natural language query from untrimmed videos. This paper discusses the challenge of achieving efficient computation in TSGV models while maintaining high performance. Most existing approaches exquisitely design complex architectures to improve accuracy with extra layers and loss, suffering from inefficiency and heaviness. Although some works have noticed that, they only make an issue of feature fusion layers, which can hardly enjoy the highspeed merit in the whole clunky network. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel efficient multi-teacher model (EMTM) based on knowledge distillation to transfer diverse knowledge from both heterogeneous and isomorphic networks. Specifically, We first unify different outputs of the heterogeneous models into one single form. Next, a Knowledge Aggregation Unit (KAU) is built to acquire high-quality integrated soft labels from multiple teachers. After that, the KAU module leverages the multi-scale video and global query information to adaptively determine the weights of different teachers. A Shared Encoder strategy is then proposed to solve the problem that the student shallow layers hardly benefit from teachers, in which an isomorphic teacher is collaboratively trained with the student to align their hidden states. Extensive experimental results on three popular TSGV benchmarks demonstrate that our method is both effective and efficient without bells and whistles.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, the Video-conditional Prompting (VP) module processes context tokens to generate informative prompts in the text modality.

A fundamental and crucial requirement for representation learning in CTDGs is the appropriate estimation and preservation of proximity. However, due to the sparse and evolving characteristics of CTDGs, the spatial-temporal properties inherent in high-order proximity remain largely unexplored. Despite its importance, this property presents significant challenges due to the computationally intensive nature of personalized interaction intensity estimation and the dynamic attributes of CTDGs. To this end, we propose a novel Correlated Spatial-Temporal Positional encoding that incorporates a parameter-free personalized interaction intensity estimation under the weak assumption of the Poisson Point Process. Building on this, we introduce the Dynamic Graph Transformer with \Correlated Spatial-Temporal Positional Encoding (CorDGT), which efficiently retains the evolving spatial-temporal high-order proximity for effective node representation learning in CTDGs. Extensive experiments on seven small and two large-scale datasets demonstrate the superior performance and scalability of the proposed CorDGT.</p></details> |  |
| **[TLRN: Temporal Latent Residual Networks For Large Deformation Image Registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11219v2)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel approach, termed {\em Temporal Latent Residual Network (TLRN)}, to predict a sequence of deformation fields in time-series image registration. The challenge of registering time-series images often lies in the occurrence of large motions, especially when images differ significantly from a reference (e.g., the start of a cardiac cycle compared to the peak stretching phase). To achieve accurate and robust registration results, we leverage the nature of motion continuity and exploit the temporal smoothness in consecutive image frames. Our proposed TLRN highlights a temporal residual network with residual blocks carefully designed in latent deformation spaces, which are parameterized by time-sequential initial velocity fields. We treat a sequence of residual blocks over time as a dynamic training system, where each block is designed to learn the residual function between desired deformation features and current input accumulated from previous time frames. We validate the effectivenss of TLRN on both synthetic data and real-world cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image videos. Our experimental results shows that TLRN is able to achieve substantially improved registration accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/nellie689/TLRN.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages. Accepted by MICCAI 2024</p></details> |
| **[Two-stage Generative Question Answering on Temporal Knowledge Graph Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16568v2)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) poses a significant challenge task, due to the temporal constraints hidden in questions and the answers sought from dynamic structured knowledge. Although large language models (LLMs) have made considerable progress in their reasoning ability over structured data, their application to the TKGQA task is a relatively unexplored area. This paper first proposes a novel generative temporal knowledge graph question answering framework, GenTKGQA, which guides LLMs to answer temporal questions through two phases: Subgraph Retrieval and Answer Generation. First, we exploit LLM's intrinsic knowledge to mine temporal constraints and structural links in the questions without extra training, thus narrowing down the subgraph search space in both temporal and structural dimensions. Next, we design virtual knowledge indicators to fuse the graph neural network signals of the subgraph and the text representations of the LLM in a non-shallow way, which helps the open-source LLM deeply understand the temporal order and structural dependencies among the retrieved facts through instruction tuning. Experimental results on two widely used datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL(Findings) 2024</p></details> |

Existing methods either utilize multi-modal information in video-text pairs or apply global and local alignment techniques to promote alignment precision. However, these methods often fail to fully explore the spatio-temporal relationships among vision tokens within video and across different video-text pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer module to uniformly learn spatial and temporal contexts for video-language alignment pre-training (dubbed STGT). Specifically, our STGT combines spatio-temporal graph structure information with attention in transformer block, effectively utilizing the spatio-temporal contexts. In this way, we can model the relationships between vision tokens, promoting video-text alignment precision for benefiting downstream tasks. In addition, we propose a self-similarity alignment loss to explore the inherent self-similarity in the video and text. With the initial optimization achieved by contrastive learning, it can further promote the alignment accuracy between video and text. Experimental results on challenging downstream tasks, including video-text retrieval and video question answering, verify the superior performance of our method.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Coarse-to-Fine Proposal Refinement Framework for Audio Temporal Forgery Detection and Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16554v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a novel form of audio partial forgery has posed challenges to its forensics, requiring advanced countermeasures to detect subtle forgery manipulations within long-duration audio. However, existing countermeasures still serve a classification purpose and fail to perform meaningful analysis of the start and end timestamps of partial forgery segments. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel coarse-to-fine proposal refinement framework (CFPRF) that incorporates a frame-level detection network (FDN) and a proposal refinement network (PRN) for audio temporal forgery detection and localization. Specifically, the FDN aims to mine informative inconsistency cues between real and fake frames to obtain discriminative features that are beneficial for roughly indicating forgery regions. The PRN is responsible for predicting confidence scores and regression offsets to refine the coarse-grained proposals derived from the FDN. To learn robust discriminative features, we devise a difference-aware feature learning (DAFL) module guided by contrastive representation learning to enlarge the sensitive differences between different frames induced by minor manipulations. We further design a boundary-aware feature enhancement (BAFE) module to capture the contextual information of multiple transition boundaries and guide the interaction between boundary information and temporal features via a cross-attention mechanism. Extensive experiments show that our CFPRF achieves state-of-the-art performance on various datasets, including LAV-DF, ASVS2019PS, and HAD.</p></details> | <details><summary>9page...</summary><p>9pages, 3figures.

Current state-of-the-art methods either require multiple independent stages of processing that employ motion cues or, in the case of end-to-end trainable networks, lack in segmentation accuracy, in part due to the difficulty of learning segmentation maps from videos with transient object presence. This limits the application of WSVOS for semantic annotation of surgical videos where multiple surgical tools frequently move in and out of the field of view, a problem that is more difficult than typically encountered in WSVOS. This paper introduces Video Spatio-Temporal Disentanglement Networks (VDST-Net), a framework to disentangle spatiotemporal information using semi-decoupled knowledge distillation to predict high-quality class activation maps (CAMs). A teacher network designed to resolve temporal conflicts when specifics about object location and timing in the video are not provided works with a student network that integrates information over time by leveraging temporal dependencies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on a public reference dataset and on a more challenging surgical video dataset where objects are, on average, present in less than 60\% of annotated frames. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and generates superior segmentation masks under video-level weak supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

We consider two variants depending on whether an edge is blocked. In the locally-informed variant, the traveller learns if an edge is blocked upon reaching one of its endpoints, while in the uninformed variant, they discover this only when the edge is supposed to appear. We provide a polynomial algorithm for each shortest path variant in the uninformed case. This algorithm also solves the case of directed acyclic non-temporal graphs. In the locally-informed case, we prove that finding a winning strategy is PSPACE-complete. Moreover, we establish that the problem is polynomial-time solvable when $k=1$ but NP-hard for $k\geq 2$. Additionally, we show that the standard (non-temporal) Canadian Traveller Problem is NP-hard when there are $k\geq 4$ blocked edges, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first hardness result for CTP for a constant number of blocked edges.</p></details> |  |

How do these digital traces change in response to events happening in the real world? We leverage Reddit conversation data, exploiting its community-based structure, to elucidate how offline events influence online user interactions and behavior. Online conversations, as posts and comments, are analysed along their temporal and semantic dimensions. Conversations tend to become repetitive with a more limited vocabulary, develop at a faster pace and feature heightened emotions. As the event approaches, the shifts occurring in conversations are reflected in the users' dynamics. Users become more active and they exchange information with a growing audience, despite using a less rich vocabulary and repetitive messages. The recurring patterns we discovered are persistent across a wide range of events and several contexts, representing a fingerprint of how online dynamics change in response to real-world occurrences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mobius: A High Efficient Spatial-Temporal Parallel Training Paradigm for Text-to-Video Generation Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06617v4)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the success of the text-to-image (T2I) generation task, many researchers are devoting themselves to the text-to-video (T2V) generation task. Most of the T2V frameworks usually inherit from the T2I model and add extra-temporal layers of training to generate dynamic videos, which can be viewed as a fine-tuning task. However, the traditional 3D-Unet is a serial mode and the temporal layers follow the spatial layers, which will result in high GPU memory and training time consumption according to its serial feature flow. We believe that this serial mode will bring more training costs with the large diffusion model and massive datasets, which are not environmentally friendly and not suitable for the development of the T2V. Therefore, we propose a highly efficient spatial-temporal parallel training paradigm for T2V tasks, named Mobius. In our 3D-Unet, the temporal layers and spatial layers are parallel, which optimizes the feature flow and backpropagation. The Mobius will save 24% GPU memory and 12% training time, which can greatly improve the T2V fine-tuning task and provide a novel insight for the AIGC community. We will release our codes in the future.</p></details> |  |

The knowledge tree enables the visualization of hierarchical interrelation within the STKG, while the knowledge net elucidates semantic relationships among knowledge entities. Additionally, the knowledge map displays spatial and temporal distributions via spatial maps and time axes, respectively. Our visualization technology addresses the limitations inherent in single-view approaches and the deficiency of interaction in spatio-temporal perspectives evident in existing visualization methods. Moreover, we have encapsulated this technology within an integrated, open-source platform named GeoViz.

| **[TransFeat-TPP: An Interpretable Deep Covariate Temporal Point Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16161v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The classical temporal point process (TPP) constructs an intensity function by taking the occurrence times into account. Nevertheless, occurrence time may not be the only relevant factor, other contextual data, termed covariates, may also impact the event evolution. Incorporating such covariates into the model is beneficial, while distinguishing their relevance to the event dynamics is of great practical significance. In this work, we propose a Transformer-based covariate temporal point process (TransFeat-TPP) model to improve the interpretability of deep covariate-TPPs while maintaining powerful expressiveness. TransFeat-TPP can effectively model complex relationships between events and covariates, and provide enhanced interpretability by discerning the importance of various covariates. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate improved prediction accuracy and consistently interpretable feature importance when compared to existing deep covariate-TPPs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Transformer Captures Spatial-Temporal Dependencies: A Theory for Gaussian Process Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16134v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformer, the backbone of Sora for video generation, successfully scales the capacity of diffusion models, pioneering new avenues for high-fidelity sequential data generation. Unlike static data such as images, sequential data consists of consecutive data frames indexed by time, exhibiting rich spatial and temporal dependencies. These dependencies represent the underlying dynamic model and are critical to validate the generated data. In this paper, we make the first theoretical step towards bridging diffusion transformers for capturing spatial-temporal dependencies. Specifically, we establish score approximation and distribution estimation guarantees of diffusion transformers for learning Gaussian process data with covariance functions of various decay patterns. We highlight how the spatial-temporal dependencies are captured and affect learning efficiency. Our study proposes a novel transformer approximation theory, where the transformer acts to unroll an algorithm. We support our theoretical results by numerical experiments, providing strong evidence that spatial-temporal dependencies are captured within attention layers, aligning with our approximation theory.</p></details> | 52 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Towards Effective Fusion and Forecasting of Multimodal Spatio-temporal Data for Smart Mobility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16123v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of location based services, multimodal spatio-temporal (ST) data including trajectories, transportation modes, traffic flow and social check-ins are being collected for deep learning based methods. These deep learning based methods learn ST correlations to support the downstream tasks in the fields such as smart mobility, smart city and other intelligent transportation systems. Despite their effectiveness, ST data fusion and forecasting methods face practical challenges in real-world scenarios. First, forecasting performance for ST data-insufficient area is inferior, making it necessary to transfer meta knowledge from heterogeneous area to enhance the sparse representations. Second, it is nontrivial to accurately forecast in multi-transportation-mode scenarios due to the fine-grained ST features of similar transportation modes, making it necessary to distinguish and measure the ST correlations to alleviate the influence caused by entangled ST features. At last, partial data modalities (e.g., transportation mode) are lost due to privacy or technical issues in certain scenarios, making it necessary to effectively fuse the multimodal sparse ST features and enrich the ST representations. To tackle these challenges, our research work aim to develop effective fusion and forecasting methods for multimodal ST data in smart mobility scenario. In this paper, we will introduce our recent works that investigates the challenges in terms of various real-world applications and establish the open challenges in this field for future work.</p></details> | 4 pages |

We propose a novel deep learning framework named EfficientCD, specifically designed for remote sensing image change detection. The framework employs EfficientNet as its backbone network for feature extraction. To enhance the information exchange between bi-temporal image feature maps, we have designed a new Feature Pyramid Network module targeted at remote sensing change detection, named ChangeFPN. Additionally, to make full use of the multi-level feature maps in the decoding stage, we have developed a layer-by-layer feature upsampling module combined with Euclidean distance to improve feature fusion and reconstruction during the decoding stage. The EfficientCD has been experimentally validated on four remote sensing datasets: LEVIR-CD, SYSU-CD, CLCD, and WHUCD. The experimental results demonstrate that EfficientCD exhibits outstanding performance in change detection accuracy. The code and pretrained models will be released at https://github.com/dyzy41/mmrscd.</p></details> |  |

Although Bayesian methods are common in spatio-temporal modeling, standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques are usually slow for large datasets such as house price data. To tackle this problem, we propose a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal modeling approach. This method involves partitioning the data into multiple subsets and applying an appropriate Gaussian process model to each subset in parallel. The results from each subset are then combined using the Wasserstein barycenter technique to obtain the global parameters for the original problem. The proposed methodology allows for multiple observations per spatial and time unit, thereby offering added benefits for practitioners. As a real-life application, we analyze house price data of more than 0.6 million transactions from 983 middle layer super output areas in London over a period of eight years. The methodology provides insightful findings about the effects of various amenities, trend patterns, and the relationship between prices and carbon emissions. Furthermore, as demonstrated through a cross-validation study, it shows good predictive accuracy while balancing computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary material is available from the authors upon request</p></details> |

Furthermore, we propose a learnable deformation representation based on the learnable control points and blending weights, which can deform the template surface non-rigidly while maintaining the consistency of the local shape. Experimental results demonstrate the significant superiority of DynoSurf over current state-of-the-art approaches, showcasing its potential as a powerful tool for dynamic mesh reconstruction.

Large space-time datasets call for new numerical methods to efficiently process them. The Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) approach has proven to be effective for the estimation and the prediction in a spatial context. We present here the advection-diffusion SPDE with first order derivative in time which defines a large class of nonseparable spatio-temporal models. A Gaussian Markov random field approximation of the solution to the SPDE is built by discretizing the temporal derivative with a finite difference method (implicit Euler) and by solving the spatial SPDE with a finite element method (continuous Galerkin) at each time step. The ''Streamline Diffusion'' stabilization technique is introduced when the advection term dominates the diffusion. Computationally efficient methods are proposed to estimate the parameters of the SPDE and to predict the spatio-temporal field by kriging, as well as to perform conditional simulations. The approach is applied to a solar radiation dataset. Its advantages and limitations are discussed.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, scholars have been actively investigating efficacious self-supervised pre-training paradigms. Nevertheless, temporal information, which is inherent in the LiDAR point cloud sequence, is consistently disregarded. To better utilize this property, we propose an effective pre-training strategy, namely Temporal Masked Auto-Encoders (T-MAE), which takes as input temporally adjacent frames and learns temporal dependency. A SiamWCA backbone, containing a Siamese encoder and a windowed cross-attention (WCA) module, is established for the two-frame input. Considering that the movement of an ego-vehicle alters the view of the same instance, temporal modeling also serves as a robust and natural data augmentation, enhancing the comprehension of target objects. SiamWCA is a powerful architecture but heavily relies on annotated data. Our T-MAE pre-training strategy alleviates its demand for annotated data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that T-MAE achieves the best performance on both Waymo and ONCE datasets among competitive self-supervised approaches.

In this paper, we propose a holistic framework that jointly optimizes the total latency and energy consumption for UAV-assisted fog computing in a three-dimensional spatial domain with varying terrain elevations and dynamic task generations. Our proposed framework considers three important and interdependent modules: attitude control, trajectory planning, and task assignment. We first establish a fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative control model to determine the UAV's attitude. Then, we propose an enhanced Ant Colony System (ACS) based algorithm, that includes a safety value and a decoupling mechanism to overcome the convergence issue in classical ACS, to compute the optimal UAV trajectory. Finally, we design an algorithm based on the Particle Swarm Optimization technique, to determine where each offloaded task should be executed. Under our proposed framework, the outcome of one module would affect the decision-making in one other, providing a holistic perspective of the system and thus leading to improved solutions. We demonstrate by extensive simulation results that our proposed framework can significantly improve the overall performance, measured by latency and energy consumption, compared to existing baseline approaches.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

Our goal is to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) match human-like paths while navigating in crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We use VLMs and a visual prompting approach with their zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our methods in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe at least 3.35% improvement in the traversability and 20.61% improvement in terms of human-like navigation in generated trajectories in challenging outdoor navigation scenarios, such as sidewalks, crosswalks, etc.</p></details> |  |

Such manoeuvring flight envelope variations, governed by the aircraft's complex nonlinear dynamics, are unpredictable by pilots and existing flight management systems. To prevent in-flight Loss of Control, post-failure trajectories must be optimal, planned in real-time, avoid terrain, and adhere to the impaired aircraft's reduced manoeuvrability and dynamic constraints. This paper presents a novel real-time trajectory optimization method for impaired aircraft based on a combination of differential flatness theory, the pseudospectral method, nonlinear programming, and inverse dynamics. In the proposed method, which utilizes a high-fidelity nonlinear six degree-of-freedom model, to conform to aircraft's altered dynamics a sequence of trim points is selected from the impaired aircraft's manoeuvring flight envelope based on the chosen optimization criteria, ensuring that the resulting three-dimensional trajectory observes terrain avoidance. Then, the required control inputs are obtained for each manoeuvre in less than a second. The method is applied to the NASA Generic Transport Model with rudder failure near a complex mountainous terrain. Both an optimal one-piece trajectory and a near-optimal piecewise path consisting of several optimal trajectories, are generated in non-real-time and real-time, respectively, and compared. Results show that the near-optimal real-time trajectory retains up to 80% of the optimality.</p></details> | <details><summary>56 pa...</summary><p>56 pages, 21 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Existing motion prediction approaches have ample room for improvement, particularly in terms of long-term prediction accuracy and interpretability. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing LC-LLM, an explainable lane change prediction model that leverages the strong reasoning capabilities and self-explanation abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Essentially, we reformulate the lane change prediction task as a language modeling problem, processing heterogeneous driving scenario information as natural language prompts for LLMs and employing supervised fine-tuning to tailor LLMs specifically for lane change prediction task. Additionally, we finetune the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve prediction transparency and reliability, and include explanatory requirements in the prompts during inference stage. Therefore, our LC-LLM model not only predicts lane change intentions and trajectories but also provides CoT reasoning and explanations for its predictions, enhancing its interpretability. Extensive experiments based on the large-scale highD dataset demonstrate the superior performance and interpretability of our LC-LLM in lane change prediction task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize LLMs for predicting lane change behavior. Our study shows that LLMs can effectively encode comprehensive interaction information for driving behavior understanding.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

Due to a large amount of variability in brain anatomy between different individuals, we hypothesize that leveraging MRI time series can help improve specificity, by treating each patient as their own baseline. Here we turn to conditional variational autoencoders to generate individualized MRI predictions given the subject's age, disease status and one previous scan. Using serial imaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we train a novel architecture to build a latent space distribution which can be sampled from to generate future predictions of changing anatomy. This enables us to extrapolate beyond the dataset and predict MRIs up to 10 years. We evaluated the model on a held-out set from ADNI and an independent dataset (from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies). By comparing to several alternatives, we show that our model produces more individualized images with higher resolution. Further, if an individual already has a follow-up MRI, we demonstrate a usage of our model to compute a likelihood ratio classifier for disease status. In practice, the model may be able to assist in early diagnosis of AD and provide a counterfactual baseline trajectory for treatment effect estimation. Furthermore, it generates a synthetic dataset that can potentially be used for downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI 2024 LDTM workshop</p></details> |

In particular, the tasks of different types and service requirements in MEC network are offloaded from one UAV to another. To pursue the goal of low-carbon edge computing, we study the problem of minimizing system energy consumption by jointly optimizing computation resource allocation, task scheduling, service placement, and UAV trajectories. Considering the inherent unpredictability associated with task generation and the dynamic nature of wireless fading channels, addressing this problem presents a significant challenge. To overcome this issue, we reformulate the complicated non-convex problem as a Markov decision process and propose a soft actor-critic-based trajectory optimization and resource allocation algorithm to implement a flexible learning strategy. Numerical results illustrate that within a multi-UAV-enabled MEC network, the proposed algorithm effectively reduces the system energy consumption in heterogeneous tasks and services scenarios compared to other baseline solutions.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |

In the past, relatively simple physics-motivated priors have been considered for such approaches, using assumptions such as constant velocity or acceleration. This paper presents an approach to incorporating exogenous control inputs, such as velocity or acceleration commands, into the continuous Gaussian process state-estimation framework. It is shown that this approach generalizes across different domains in robotics, making it applicable to both the estimation of continuous-time trajectories for mobile robots and continuum-robot shapes.

In this study, we focus on a scenario where a connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) serves as the central agent, utilizing both sensors and communication technologies to perceive its surrounding traffics consisting of autonomous vehicles (AVs), connected vehicles (CVs), and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Our trajectory prediction task is aimed at all the detected surrounding vehicles. To effectively integrate the multi-source data from both sensor and communication technologies, we propose a deep learning framework called MSMA utilizing a cross-attention module for multi-source data fusion. Vector map data is utilized to provide contextual information. The trajectory dataset is collected in CARLA simulator with synthesized data errors introduced. Numerical experiments demonstrate that in a mixed traffic flow scenario, the integration of data from different sources enhances our understanding of the environment. This notably improves trajectory prediction accuracy, particularly in situations with a high CV market penetration rate. The code is available at: https://github.com/xichennn/MSMA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformal Trajectory Prediction with Multi-View Data Integration in Cooperative Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00374v2)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current research on trajectory prediction primarily relies on data collected by onboard sensors of an ego vehicle. With the rapid advancement in connected technologies, such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, valuable information from alternate views becomes accessible via wireless networks. The integration of information from alternative views has the potential to overcome the inherent limitations associated with a single viewpoint, such as occlusions and limited field of view. In this work, we introduce V2INet, a novel trajectory prediction framework designed to model multi-view data by extending existing single-view models. Unlike previous approaches where the multi-view data is manually fused or formulated as a separate training stage, our model supports end-to-end training, enhancing both flexibility and performance. Moreover, the predicted multimodal trajectories are calibrated by a post-hoc conformal prediction module to get valid and efficient confidence regions. We evaluated the entire framework using the real-world V2I dataset V2X-Seq. Our results demonstrate superior performance in terms of Final Displacement Error (FDE) and Miss Rate (MR) using a single GPU.

However, the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) are based on supervised deep learning - which leads to challenges when the distribution of trajectories changes due to such a shock. We provide a neuro-symbolic rule-based framework to conduct error correction and detection of these models to integrate into our movement trajectory platform. We provide a suite of experiments on several recent SOTA models where we show highly accurate error detection, the ability to improve accuracy with a changing test distribution, and accuracy improvement for the base use case in addition to a suite of theoretical properties that informed algorithm development. Specifically, we show an F1 scores for predicting errors of up to 0.984, significant performance increase for out-of distribution accuracy (8.51% improvement over SOTA for zero-shot accuracy), and accuracy improvement over the SOTA model.</p></details> |  |

To tackle these challenges, we introduce Optimal Gaussian Diffusion (OGD) and Estimated Clean Manifold (ECM) Guidance. OGD optimizes the prior distribution for a small diffusion time $T$ and starts the reverse diffusion process from it. ECM directly injects guidance gradients to the estimated clean manifold, eliminating extensive gradient backpropagation throughout the network. Our methodology streamlines the generative process, enabling practical applications with reduced computational overhead. Experimental validation on the large-scale Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrates our approach's superior performance, offering a viable solution for computationally efficient, high-quality joint trajectory prediction and controllable generation for autonomous driving.

In this process, the complexity of algorithms used for vehicle control has grown significantly. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a prominent example, which has gained enormous popularity and is now widely used for vehicle motion planning and control. However, safety concerns constrain its practical application, especially since traditional procedures of functional safety (FS), with its universal standard ISO26262, reach their limits. Concomitantly, the new aspect of safety-of-the-intended-function (SOTIF) has moved into the center of attention, whose standard, ISO21448, has only been released in 2022. Thus, experience with SOTIF is low and few case studies are available in industry and research. Hence this paper aims to make two main contributions: (1) an analysis of the SOTIF for a generic MPC-based trajectory planner and (2) an interpretation and concrete application of the generic procedures described in ISO21448 for determining functional insufficiencies (FIs) and triggering conditions (TCs). Particular novelties of the paper include an approach for the out-of-context development of SOTIF-related elements (SOTIF-EooC), a compilation of important FIs and TCs for a MPC-based trajectory planner, and an optimized safety concept based on the identified FIs and TCs for the MPC-based trajectory planner.</p></details> | Extended Version |

We propose an expression exploration framework based on deep symbolic regression (DSR) integrated with a variable intersection selection (VIS) method to find variable combinations that encourage interpretable and parsimonious mathematical expressions. In the exploration learning process, two penalty terms are added to improve the reward function: (i) a complexity penalty to regulate the complexity of the explored expressions to be parsimonious, and (ii) a variable interaction penalty to encourage the expression exploration to focus on variable combinations that can best describe the data. We show the performance of the proposed method to learn several car-following dynamics models and discuss its limitations and future research directions.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, the potential of transformer-based diffusion models for effectively generating videos with controllable motion remains an area of limited exploration. This paper introduces Tora, the first trajectory-oriented DiT framework that integrates textual, visual, and trajectory conditions concurrently for video generation. Specifically, Tora consists of a Trajectory Extractor~(TE), a Spatial-Temporal DiT, and a Motion-guidance Fuser~(MGF). The TE encodes arbitrary trajectories into hierarchical spacetime motion patches with a 3D video compression network. The MGF integrates the motion patches into the DiT blocks to generate consistent videos following trajectories. Our design aligns seamlessly with DiT's scalability, allowing precise control of video content's dynamics with diverse durations, aspect ratios, and resolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate Tora's excellence in achieving high motion fidelity, while also meticulously simulating the movement of the physical world.

Learning-based approaches for multi-agent trajectory prediction, such as primarily relying on graph neural networks, graph transformers, and hypergraph neural networks, have demonstrated outstanding performance on real-world datasets in recent years. However, the hypergraph transformer-based method for trajectory prediction is yet to be explored. Therefore, we present a MultiscAle Relational Transformer (MART) network for multi-agent trajectory prediction. MART is a hypergraph transformer architecture to consider individual and group behaviors in transformer machinery. The core module of MART is the encoder, which comprises a Pair-wise Relational Transformer (PRT) and a Hyper Relational Transformer (HRT). The encoder extends the capabilities of a relational transformer by introducing HRT, which integrates hyperedge features into the transformer mechanism, promoting attention weights to focus on group-wise relations. In addition, we propose an Adaptive Group Estimator (AGE) designed to infer complex group relations in real-world environments. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets (NBA, SDD, and ETH-UCY) demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, enhancing ADE/FDE by 3.9%/11.8% on the NBA dataset.

Due to the intractable growth of non-convex constraints with the number of agents, exploring various homotopy classes that imply different convex domains, is crucial for finding a feasible solution. However, existing methods struggle to explore various homotopy classes efficiently due to combining it with time-consuming precise trajectory solution finding. CSDO, addresses this limitation by separating them into different levels and integrating an efficient Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithm to search homotopy classes. It first searches for a coarse initial guess using a large search step, identifying a specific homotopy class. Subsequent decentralized Quadratic Programming (QP) refinement processes this guess, resolving minor collisions efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that CSDO outperforms existing MVTP algorithms in large-scale, high-density scenarios, achieving up to 95% success rate in 50m $\times$ 50m random scenarios around one second.

We introduce the Enhanced Transformer for Health Outcome Simulation (ETHOS), a novel application of the transformer deep-learning architecture for analyzing high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and episodic health data. ETHOS is trained using Patient Health Timelines (PHTs)-detailed, tokenized records of health events-to predict future health trajectories, leveraging a zero-shot learning approach. ETHOS represents a significant advancement in foundation model development for healthcare analytics, eliminating the need for labeled data and model fine-tuning. Its ability to simulate various treatment pathways and consider patient-specific factors positions ETHOS as a tool for care optimization and addressing biases in healthcare delivery. Future developments will expand ETHOS' capabilities to incorporate a wider range of data types and data sources. Our work demonstrates a pathway toward accelerated AI development and deployment in healthcare.</p></details> |  |
| **[Acting upon Imagination: when to trust imagined trajectories in model based reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05716v6)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) aims to learn model(s) of the environment dynamics that can predict the outcome of its actions. Forward application of the model yields so called imagined trajectories (sequences of action, predicted state-reward) used to optimize the set of candidate actions that maximize expected reward. The outcome, an ideal imagined trajectory or plan, is imperfect and typically MBRL relies on model predictive control (MPC) to overcome this by continuously re-planning from scratch, incurring thus major computational cost and increasing complexity in tasks with longer receding horizon. We propose uncertainty estimation methods for online evaluation of imagined trajectories to assess whether further planned actions can be trusted to deliver acceptable reward. These methods include comparing the error after performing the last action with the standard expected error and using model uncertainty to assess the deviation from expected outcomes. Additionally, we introduce methods that exploit the forward propagation of the dynamics model to evaluate if the remainder of the plan aligns with expected results and assess the remainder of the plan in terms of the expected reward. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed uncertainty estimation methods by applying them to avoid unnecessary trajectory replanning in a shooting MBRL setting. Results highlight significant reduction on computational costs without sacrificing performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safe and Non-Conservative Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Driving Handling Unanticipated Behaviors of Traffic Participants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13396v2)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning for autonomous driving is challenging because the unknown future motion of traffic participants must be accounted for, yielding large uncertainty. Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC)-based planners provide non-conservative planning, but do not rule out a (small) probability of collision. We propose a control scheme that yields an efficient trajectory based on SMPC when the traffic scenario allows, still avoiding that the vehicle causes collisions with traffic participants if the latter move according to the prediction assumptions. If some traffic participant does not behave as anticipated, no safety guarantee can be given. Then, our approach yields a trajectory which minimizes the probability of collision, using Constraint Violation Probability Minimization techniques. Our algorithm can also be adapted to minimize the anticipated harm caused by a collision. We provide a thorough discussion of the benefits of our novel control scheme and compare it to a previous approach through numerical simulations from the CommonRoad database.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scene-Specific Trajectory Sets: Maximizing Representation in Motion Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20732v1)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representing diverse and plausible future trajectories of actors is crucial for motion forecasting in autonomous driving. However, efficiently capturing the true trajectory distribution with a compact set is challenging. In this work, we propose a novel approach for generating scene-specific trajectory sets that better represent the diversity and admissibility of future actor behavior. Our method constructs multiple trajectory sets tailored to different scene contexts, such as intersections and non-intersections, by leveraging map information and actor dynamics. We introduce a deterministic goal sampling algorithm that identifies relevant map regions and generates trajectories conditioned on the scene layout. Furthermore, we empirically investigate various sampling strategies and set sizes to optimize the trade-off between coverage and diversity. Experiments on the Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrate that our scene-specific sets achieve higher plausibility while maintaining diversity compared to traditional single-set approaches. The proposed Recursive In-Distribution Subsampling (RIDS) method effectively condenses the representation space and outperforms metric-driven sampling in terms of trajectory admissibility. Our work highlights the benefits of scene-aware trajectory set generation for capturing the complex and heterogeneous nature of actor behavior in real-world driving scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Aircraft Trajectory Segmentation-based Contrastive Coding (ATSCC), a novel self-supervised time series representation learning framework designed to capture semantic information in air traffic trajectory data. The framework leverages the segmentable characteristic of trajectories and ensures consistency within the self-assigned segments. Intensive experiments were conducted on datasets from three different airports, totaling four datasets, comparing the learned representation's performance of downstream classification and clustering with other state-of-the-art representation learning techniques. The results show that ATSCC outperforms these methods by aligning with the labels defined by aeronautical procedures. ATSCC is adaptable to various airport configurations and scalable to incomplete trajectories. This research has expanded upon existing capabilities, achieving these improvements independently without predefined inputs such as airport configurations, maneuvering procedures, or labeled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures.

Typical stochastic mobility models, e.g., random waypoint model and Gauss Markov model, can hardly capture the distribution characteristics of users within real-world areas. State-of-the-art trace-based mobility models and existing learning-based trajectory generation methods, however, are frequently constrained by the inaccessibility of substantial real trajectories due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we harness the intrinsic correlation between street maps and trajectories and develop a novel zero-shot trajectory generation method, named Map2Traj, by exploiting the diffusion model. We incorporate street maps as a condition to consistently pilot the denoising process and train our model on diverse sets of real trajectories from various regions in Xi'an, China, and their corresponding street maps. With solely the street map of an unobserved area, Map2Traj generates synthetic trajectories that not only closely resemble the real-world mobility pattern but also offer comparable efficacy. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our proposed method on zero-shot trajectory generation tasks in terms of both trajectory and distribution similarities. In addition, a case study of employing Map2Traj in wireless network optimization is presented to validate its efficacy for downstream applications.</p></details> |  |

SAPI uses an abstract way to represent and encode surrounding environment by utilizing information from real-time map, right-of-way, and surrounding traffic. The proposed model consists of two convolutional network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN)-based encoders and one decoder. A refiner is proposed to conduct a look-back operation inside the model, in order to make full use of raw history trajectory information. We evaluate SAPI on a proprietary dataset collected in real-world intersections through autonomous vehicles. It is demonstrated that SAPI shows promising performance when predicting vehicle trajectories at intersection, and outperforms benchmark methods. The average displacement error(ADE) and final displacement error(FDE) for 6-second prediction are 1.84m and 4.32m respectively. We also show that the proposed model can accurately predict vehicle trajectories in different scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Recent manifold learning-based methods have partially addressed the dimensionality and dataset size issues, but struggle with the complex text-conditional distribution. In this paper we propose a text-based trajectory generation model that attempts to address all three challenges while relying on only a handful of demonstration trajectory data. Our key idea is to leverage recent flow-based models capable of capturing complex conditional distributions, not directly in the high-dimensional trajectory space, but rather in the low-dimensional latent coordinate space of the motion manifold, with deliberately designed regularization terms to ensure smoothness of motions and robustness to text variations. We show that our {\it Motion Manifold Flow Primitive (MMFP)} framework can accurately generate qualitatively distinct motions for a wide range of text inputs, significantly outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, under review</p></details> |

Traditional methods usually perform holistic inference on the trajectories of agents, neglecting the differences in prediction difficulty among agents. This paper proposes a novel Difficulty-Guided Feature Enhancement Network (DGFNet), which leverages the prediction difficulty differences among agents for multi-agent trajectory prediction. Firstly, we employ spatio-temporal feature encoding and interaction to capture rich spatio-temporal features. Secondly, a difficulty-guided decoder is used to control the flow of future trajectories into subsequent modules, obtaining reliable future trajectories. Then, feature interaction and fusion are performed through the future feature interaction module. Finally, the fused agent features are fed into the final predictor to generate the predicted trajectory distributions for multiple participants. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Argoverse 1\&2 motion forecasting benchmarks. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each module. Moreover, compared with SOTA methods, our method balances trajectory prediction accuracy and real-time inference speed.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, with the increasing granularity and complexity of vehicle-generated data, the lack of data quality audits raises concerns about multi-party mistrust in trajectory prediction tasks. In response, this paper proposes an asynchronous federated learning data sharing method based on an interpretable reputation quantization mechanism utilizing graph neural network tools. Data providers share data structures under differential privacy constraints to ensure security while reducing redundant data. We implement deep reinforcement learning to categorize vehicles by reputation level, which optimizes the aggregation efficiency of federated learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed data sharing scheme not only reinforces the security of the trajectory prediction task but also enhances prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Human trajectory prediction is a noisy process, and no prediction does precisely match any future trajectory. It is therefore approached as a stochastic problem, where the goal is to minimise the error between the true and the predicted trajectory. In this work, we explore the application of metamorphic testing for human trajectory prediction. Metamorphic testing is designed to handle unclear or missing test oracles. It is well-designed for human trajectory prediction, where there is no clear criterion of correct or incorrect human behaviour. Metamorphic relations rely on transformations over source test cases and exploit invariants. A setting well-designed for human trajectory prediction where there are many symmetries of expected human behaviour under variations of the input, e.g. mirroring and rescaling of the input data. We discuss how metamorphic testing can be applied to stochastic human trajectory prediction and introduce the Wasserstein Violation Criterion to statistically assess whether a follow-up test case violates a label-preserving metamorphic relation.</p></details> | <details><summary>MET'2...</summary><p>MET'24: 9th ACM International Workshop on Metamorphic Testing</p></details> |

If the opposing vehicles do not react to the ego vehicle, they can be predicted accurately. However, if there is interaction between the vehicles, the prediction loses its validity. For high interaction, instead of a planning approach that reacts exclusively to the fixed prediction, a trajectory planning approach is required that incorporates the interaction with the opposing vehicles. This paper demonstrates the limitations of a widely used conventional sampling-based approach within a highly interactive blocking scenario. We show that high success rates are achieved for less aggressive blocking behavior but that the collision rate increases with more significant interaction. We further propose a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based trajectory planning approach for racing that explicitly exploits the interaction with the opposing vehicle without requiring a prediction. In contrast to the conventional approach, the RL-based approach achieves high success rates even for aggressive blocking behavior. Furthermore, we propose a novel safety layer (SL) that intervenes when the trajectory generated by the RL-based approach is infeasible. In that event, the SL generates a sub-optimal but feasible trajectory, avoiding termination of the scenario due to a not found valid solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, accepted to be published at the 27th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems, September 24 - 27, 2024, Edmonton, Canada</p></details> |

However, existing methods often struggle to simultaneously satisfy these two critical requirements. To address this issue, this paper proposes a sampling-based trajectory planning method with a hierarchical structure for formation flight in dense obstacle environments. To ensure reliable local sensing information sharing among UAVs, each UAV generates a safe flight corridor (SFC), which is transmitted to the leader UAV. Subsequently, a sampling-based formation guidance path generation method is designed as the front-end strategy, steering the formation to fly in the desired shape safely with the formation connectivity provided by the SFCs. Furthermore, a model predictive path integral (MPPI) based distributed trajectory optimization method is developed as the back-end part, which ensures the smoothness, safety and dynamics feasibility of the executable trajectory. To validate the efficiency of the developed algorithm, comprehensive simulation comparisons are conducted.

However, measuring real-world detouring behavior is challenging due to the need to track the movement of individual vehicles. Recent developments in high-resolution vehicle trajectory data have enabled transportation professionals to observe real-world detouring behaviors without the need to install and maintain hardware such as license plate reading cameras. This paper investigates the feasibility of vehicle probe trajectory data to capture commercial motor vehicle (CMV) detouring behavior under three unique case studies. Before doing so, a validation analysis was conducted to investigate the ability of CMV probe trajectory data to represent overall CMV volumes at well-calibrated count stations near virtual weigh stations (VWS) in Maryland. The validation analysis showed strong positive correlations (above 0.75) at all VWS stations. Upon validating the data, a methodology was applied to assess CMV detour behaviors associated with CMV enforcement activities, congestion avoidance, and incident induced temporary road closures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting 2024.

Existing methods often focus solely on either language or full trajectory control, lacking precision in synthesizing motions aligned with user-specified trajectories, especially for multi-joint control. To address these issues, we present TLControl, a novel method for realistic human motion synthesis, incorporating both low-level Trajectory and high-level Language semantics controls, through the integration of neural-based and optimization-based techniques. Specifically, we begin with training a VQ-VAE for a compact and well-structured latent motion space organized by body parts. We then propose a Masked Trajectories Transformer (MTT) for predicting a motion distribution conditioned on language and trajectory. Once trained, we use MTT to sample initial motion predictions given user-specified partial trajectories and text descriptions as conditioning. Finally, we introduce a test-time optimization to refine these coarse predictions for precise trajectory control, which offers flexibility by allowing users to specify various optimization goals and ensures high runtime efficiency. Comprehensive experiments show that TLControl significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in trajectory accuracy and time efficiency, making it practical for interactive and high-quality animation generation.</p></details> |  |

This model can characterize the stubbornness of the human, which measures how strong the human adheres to his preferred trajectory. Accordingly, a static model is introduced indicating a link between the force in haptically coupled human-robot interactions and humans's stubbornness. The introduced stubbornness parameter enables an application-independent reaction of the automation for the cooperative trajectory planning. Simulation results in the context of human-machine cooperation in a care application show that the proposed behavioral model can quantitatively estimate the stubbornness of the interacting human, enabling a more targeted adaptation of the automation to the human behavior.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methodologies have leaned heavily on historical trajectory data, frequently overlooking vital contextual cues such as pedestrian-specific traits and environmental factors. Furthermore, there's a notable knowledge gap as trajectory and intention prediction have largely been approached as separate problems, despite their mutual dependence. To bridge this gap, we introduce PTINet (Pedestrian Trajectory and Intention Prediction Network), which jointly learns the trajectory and intention prediction by combining past trajectory observations, local contextual features (individual pedestrian behaviors), and global features (signs, markings etc.). The efficacy of our approach is evaluated on widely used public datasets: JAAD and PIE, where it has demonstrated superior performance over existing state-of-the-art models in trajectory and intention prediction. The results from our experiments and ablation studies robustly validate PTINet's effectiveness in jointly exploring intention and trajectory prediction for pedestrian behaviour modelling. The experimental evaluation indicates the advantage of using global and local contextual features for pedestrian trajectory and intention prediction. The effectiveness of PTINet in predicting pedestrian behavior paves the way for the development of automated systems capable of seamlessly interacting with pedestrians in urban settings.</p></details> |  |

| **[Simultaneous Trajectory Optimization and Contact Selection for Contact-rich Manipulation with High-Fidelity Geometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16976v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contact-implicit trajectory optimization (CITO) is an effective method to plan complex trajectories for various contact-rich systems including manipulation and locomotion. CITO formulates a mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC) that enforces that contact forces must be zero when points are not in contact. However, MPCC solve times increase steeply with the number of allowable points of contact, which limits CITO's applicability to problems in which only a few, simple geometries are allowed to make contact. This paper introduces simultaneous trajectory optimization and contact selection (STOCS), as an extension of CITO that overcomes this limitation. The innovation of STOCS is to identify salient contact points and times inside the iterative trajectory optimization process. This effectively reduces the number of variables and constraints in each MPCC invocation. The STOCS framework, instantiated with key contact identification subroutines, renders the optimization of manipulation trajectories computationally tractable even for high-fidelity geometries consisting of tens of thousands of vertices.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2306.06465</p></details> |
| **[Synthetic Trajectory Generation Through Convolutional Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16938v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Location trajectories provide valuable insights for applications from urban planning to pandemic control. However, mobility data can also reveal sensitive information about individuals, such as political opinions, religious beliefs, or sexual orientations. Existing privacy-preserving approaches for publishing this data face a significant utility-privacy trade-off. Releasing synthetic trajectory data generated through deep learning offers a promising solution. Due to the trajectories' sequential nature, most existing models are based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, research in generative adversarial networks (GANs) largely employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image generation. This discrepancy raises the question of whether advances in computer vision can be applied to trajectory generation. In this work, we introduce a Reversible Trajectory-to-CNN Transformation (RTCT) that adapts trajectories into a format suitable for CNN-based models. We integrated this transformation with the well-known DCGAN in a proof-of-concept (PoC) and evaluated its performance against an RNN-based trajectory GAN using four metrics across two datasets. The PoC was superior in capturing spatial distributions compared to the RNN model but had difficulty replicating sequential and temporal properties. Although the PoC's utility is not sufficient for practical applications, the results demonstrate the transformation's potential to facilitate the use of CNNs for trajectory generation, opening up avenues for future research. To support continued research, all source code has been made available under an open-source license.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Privacy, Security & Trust (PST 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Guaranteed Trajectory Tracking under Learned Dynamics with Contraction Metrics and Disturbance Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08222v5)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an approach to trajectory-centric learning control based on contraction metrics and disturbance estimation for nonlinear systems subject to matched uncertainties. The approach uses deep neural networks to learn uncertain dynamics while still providing guarantees of transient tracking performance throughout the learning phase. Within the proposed approach, a disturbance estimation law is adopted to estimate the pointwise value of the uncertainty, with pre-computable estimation error bounds (EEBs). The learned dynamics, the estimated disturbances, and the EEBs are then incorporated in a robust Riemann energy condition to compute the control law that guarantees exponential convergence of actual trajectories to desired ones throughout the learning phase, even when the learned model is poor. On the other hand, with improved accuracy, the learned model can help improve the robustness of the tracking controller, e.g., against input delays, and can be incorporated to plan better trajectories with improved performance, e.g., lower energy consumption and shorter travel time.The proposed framework is validated on a planar quadrotor example.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

Multimodal trajectory prediction enhances decision-making by considering multiple possible future trajectories based on diverse sources of environmental data. In this approach, we leverage ResNet-50 to extract image features from high-definition map data and use IMU sensor data to calculate speed, acceleration, and yaw rate. A temporal probabilistic network is employed to compute potential trajectories, selecting the most accurate and highly probable trajectory paths. This method integrates HD map data to improve the robustness and reliability of trajectory predictions for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |
| **[PateGail: A Privacy-Preserving Mobility Trajectory Generator with Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16729v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating human mobility trajectories is of great importance to solve the lack of large-scale trajectory data in numerous applications, which is caused by privacy concerns. However, existing mobility trajectory generation methods still require real-world human trajectories centrally collected as the training data, where there exists an inescapable risk of privacy leakage. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we propose PateGail, a privacy-preserving imitation learning model to generate mobility trajectories, which utilizes the powerful generative adversary imitation learning model to simulate the decision-making process of humans. Further, in order to protect user privacy, we train this model collectively based on decentralized mobility data stored in user devices, where personal discriminators are trained locally to distinguish and reward the real and generated human trajectories. In the training process, only the generated trajectories and their rewards obtained based on personal discriminators are shared between the server and devices, whose privacy is further preserved by our proposed perturbation mechanisms with theoretical proof to satisfy differential privacy. Further, to better model the human decision-making process, we propose a novel aggregation mechanism of the rewards obtained from personal discriminators. We theoretically prove that under the reward obtained based on the aggregation mechanism, our proposed model maximizes the lower bound of the discounted total rewards of users. Extensive experiments show that the trajectories generated by our model are able to resemble real-world trajectories in terms of five key statistical metrics, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms by over 48.03%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the synthetic trajectories are able to efficiently support practical applications, including mobility prediction and location recommendation.</p></details> |  |

We frame constrained trajectory optimization as a novel form of constrained functional minimization over trajectory distributions, which avoids treating the constraints as a penalty in the objective and allows us to generate diverse sets of constraint-satisfying trajectories. Our method uses Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) to find a set of particles that approximates a distribution over low-cost trajectories while obeying constraints. CSVTO is applicable to problems with differentiable equality and inequality constraints and includes a novel particle re-sampling step to escape local minima. By explicitly generating diverse sets of trajectories, CSVTO is better able to avoid poor local minima and is more robust to initialization. We demonstrate that CSVTO outperforms baselines in challenging highly-constrained tasks, such as a 7DoF wrench manipulation task, where CSVTO outperforms all baselines both in success and constraint satisfaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Biological knowledge suggests that it may be best to describe complex diseases at the level of underlying pathways, which may interact with one another. We propose a Bayesian approach that allows for characterising such correlation among different pathways through Dependent Gaussian Processes (DGP) and mapping the observed high-dimensional gene expression trajectories into unobserved low-dimensional pathway expression trajectories via Bayesian Sparse Factor Analysis. Our proposal is the first attempt to relax the classical assumption of independent factors for longitudinal data and has demonstrated a superior performance in recovering the shape of pathway expression trajectories, revealing the relationships between genes and pathways, and predicting gene expressions (closer point estimates and narrower predictive intervals), as demonstrated through simulations and real data analysis. To fit the model, we propose a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM) scheme that can be implemented conveniently by combining a standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler and an R package GPFDA (Konzen and others, 2021), which returns the maximum likelihood estimates of DGP hyperparameters. The modular structure of MCEM makes it generalizable to other complex models involving the DGP model component. Our R package DGP4LCF that implements the proposed approach is available on CRAN.</p></details> |  |

However, configuring the skills' parameters for a specific task remains a manual and time-consuming endeavor. Existing approaches for learning or optimizing these parameters often require numerous real-world executions or do not work in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose MuTT, a novel encoder-decoder transformer architecture designed to predict environment-aware executions of robot skills by integrating vision, trajectory, and robot skill parameters. Notably, we pioneer the fusion of vision and trajectory, introducing a novel trajectory projection. Furthermore, we illustrate MuTT's efficacy as a predictor when combined with a model-based robot skill optimizer. This approach facilitates the optimization of robot skill parameters for the current environment, without the need for real-world executions during optimization. Designed for compatibility with any representation of robot skills, MuTT demonstrates its versatility across three comprehensive experiments, showcasing superior performance across two different skill representations.</p></details> |  |

To study this, structured clinical variables from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) data have traditionally been employed by many researchers. Presently, Natural Language Processing models have received great attention in clinical research which expanded the possibilities of using clinical narratives. In this paper, we propose a systematic methodology for developing sepsis prognostic pathways derived from clinical notes, focusing on diverse patient subgroups identified by exploring comorbidities associated with sepsis and generating explanations of these subgroups using SHAP. The extracted prognostic pathways of these subgroups provide valuable insights into the dynamic trajectories of sepsis severity over time. Visualizing these pathways sheds light on the likelihood and direction of disease progression across various contexts and reveals patterns and pivotal factors or biomarkers influencing the transition between sepsis stages, whether toward deterioration or improvement.

Some leading methods in this domain prioritize long-range matching, involving the unrolling of training trajectories with a fixed number of steps (NS) on the synthetic dataset to align with various expert training trajectories. However, traditional long-range matching methods possess an overfitting-like problem, the fixed step size NS forces synthetic dataset to distortedly conform seen expert training trajectories, resulting in a loss of generality-especially to those from unencountered architecture. We refer to this as the Accumulated Mismatching Problem (AMP), and propose a new approach, Automatic Training Trajectories (ATT), which dynamically and adaptively adjusts trajectory length NS to address the AMP. Our method outperforms existing methods particularly in tests involving cross-architectures. Moreover, owing to its adaptive nature, it exhibits enhanced stability in the face of parameter variations.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is accepted at ECCV 2024</p></details> |

This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the most prevalent distance-based vessel trajectory clustering methods, which encompass two main steps: trajectory similarity measurement and clustering. Initially, we conducted a thorough literature review using relevant keywords to gather and summarize pertinent research papers and datasets. Then, this paper discussed the principal methods of data pre-processing that prepare data for further analysis. The survey progresses to detail the leading algorithms for measuring vessel trajectory similarity and the main clustering techniques used in the field today. Furthermore, the various applications of trajectory clustering within the maritime context are explored. Finally, the paper evaluates the effectiveness of different algorithm combinations and pre-processing methods through experimental analysis, focusing on their impact on the performance of distance-based trajectory clustering algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of various trajectory clustering algorithms and notably highlight the significant improvements that trajectory compression techniques contribute to the efficiency and accuracy of trajectory clustering.

| **[Risk-Aware Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Under Safety-Critical Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13480v1)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is significant for intelligent vehicles to achieve high-level autonomous driving, and a lot of relevant research achievements have been made recently. Despite the rapid development, most existing studies solely focused on normal safe scenarios while largely neglecting safety-critical scenarios, particularly those involving imminent collisions. This oversight may result in autonomous vehicles lacking the essential predictive ability in such situations, posing a significant threat to safety. To tackle these, this paper proposes a risk-aware trajectory prediction framework tailored to safety-critical scenarios. Leveraging distinctive hazardous features, we develop three core risk-aware components. First, we introduce a risk-incorporated scene encoder, which augments conventional encoders with quantitative risk information to achieve risk-aware encoding of hazardous scene contexts. Next, we incorporate endpoint-risk-combined intention queries as prediction priors in the decoder to ensure that the predicted multimodal trajectories cover both various spatial intentions and risk levels. Lastly, an auxiliary risk prediction task is implemented for the ultimate risk-aware prediction. Furthermore, to support model training and performance evaluation, we introduce a safety-critical trajectory prediction dataset and tailored evaluation metrics. We conduct comprehensive evaluations and compare our model with several SOTA models. Results demonstrate the superior performance of our model, with a significant improvement in most metrics. This prediction advancement enables autonomous vehicles to execute correct collision avoidance maneuvers under safety-critical scenarios, eventually enhancing road traffic safety.</p></details> |  |

However, the development and ranking of state-of-the-art (SotA) models are driven by their In-Distribution (ID) performance on individual competition datasets. We present an OoD testing protocol that homogenizes datasets and prediction tasks across two large-scale motion datasets. We introduce a novel prediction algorithm based on polynomial representations for agent trajectory and road geometry on both the input and output sides of the model. With a much smaller model size, training effort, and inference time, we reach near SotA performance for ID testing and significantly improve robustness in OoD testing. Within our OoD testing protocol, we further study two augmentation strategies of SotA models and their effects on model generalization. Highlighting the contrast between ID and OoD performance, we suggest adding OoD testing to the evaluation criteria of trajectory prediction models.</p></details> |  |

It's a way of generating a smooth and feasible path for the robot to follow over time. The process primarily takes several factors to generate the path, such as velocity, acceleration and jerk. The process deals with how the robot can follow a desired motion path in a suitable environment. This trajectory planning is extensively used in Automobile Industrial Robot, Manipulators, and Mobile Robots. Trajectory planning is a fundamental component of motion control systems. To perform tasks like pick and place operations, assembly, welding, painting, path following, and obstacle avoidance. This paper introduces a comparative analysis of trajectory planning algorithms and their key software elements working strategy in complex and dynamic environments. Adaptability and real-time analysis are the most common problems in trajectory planning.

Both algorithms are inspired by a novel theoretical paradigm known as probabilistic optimal control, that reformulates optimal control as an equivalent probabilistic inference problem. This perspective allows to address the problem using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. We show that the application of this algorithm results in a fixed point iteration of probabilistic policies that converge to the deterministic optimal policy. Two strategies for policy evaluation are discussed, using state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods resulting into two distinct algorithms. The algorithms are structurally closest related to the differential dynamic programming algorithm and related methods that use sigma-point methods to avoid direct gradient evaluations. The main advantage of our work is an improved balance between exploration and exploitation over the iterations, leading to improved numerical stability and accelerated convergence. These properties are demonstrated on different nonlinear systems.</p></details> |  |

Notably, friction is not solely dependent on road surface conditions, but also varies significantly depending on the tire temperature. However, tire parameters such as the friction coefficient have been conventionally treated as constant values in automated vehicle motion planning. This paper develops a simple thermodynamic model that captures tire friction temperature variation. To verify the model, it is implemented into trajectory planning for automated drifting - a challenging application that requires leveraging an unstable, drifting equilibrium at the friction limits. The proposed method which captures the hidden tire dynamics provides a dynamically feasible trajectory, leading to more precise tracking during experiments with an LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator) controller.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript was accepted from IEEE Intelligent Vehicle Symposium (IV 2024) and will be published late August</p></details> |

Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have been developed to provably ensure system safety through forward invariance. However, they often unnecessarily sacrifice performance for safety since they are purely reactive. Receding horizon control (RHC), on the other hand, consider planned trajectories to account for the future evolution of a system. This work provides a new perspective on safety-critical control by introducing Forward Invariance in Trajectory Spaces (FITS). We lift the problem of safe RHC into the trajectory space and describe the evolution of planned trajectories as a controlled dynamical system. Safety constraints defined over states can be converted into sets in the trajectory space which we render forward invariant via a CBF framework. We derive an efficient quadratic program (QP) to synthesize trajectories that provably satisfy safety constraints. Our experiments support that FITS improves the adherence to safety specifications without sacrificing performance over alternative CBF and NMPC methods.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

It is common to map trajectories to vectors, called embeddings, before subsequent analyses. Thus, the qualities of embeddings are very important. Methods for pre-training embeddings, which leverage unlabeled trajectories for training universal embeddings, have shown promising applicability across different tasks, thus attracting considerable interest. However, research progress on this topic faces two key challenges: a lack of a comprehensive overview of existing methods, resulting in several related methods not being well-recognized, and the absence of a unified pipeline, complicating the development new methods and the analysis of methods. To overcome these obstacles and advance the field of pre-training of trajectory embeddings, we present UniTE, a survey and a unified pipeline for this domain. In doing so, we present a comprehensive list of existing methods for pre-training trajectory embeddings, which includes methods that either explicitly or implicitly employ pre-training techniques. Further, we present a unified and modular pipeline with publicly available underlying code, simplifying the process of constructing and evaluating methods for pre-training trajectory embeddings. Additionally, we contribute a selection of experimental results using the proposed pipeline on real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

Established trajectory prediction methods primarily use agent tracks generated by a detection and tracking system and HD map as inputs. In this work, we propose a novel method that also incorporates visual input from surround-view cameras, allowing the model to utilize visual cues such as human gazes and gestures, road conditions, vehicle turn signals, etc, which are typically hidden from the model in prior methods. Furthermore, we use textual descriptions generated by a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and refined by a Large Language Model (LLM) as supervision during training to guide the model on what to learn from the input data. Despite using these extra inputs, our method achieves a latency of 53 ms, making it feasible for real-time processing, which is significantly faster than that of previous single-agent prediction methods with similar performance. Our experiments show that both the visual inputs and the textual descriptions contribute to improvements in trajectory prediction performance, and our qualitative analysis highlights how the model is able to exploit these additional inputs. Lastly, in this work we create and release the nuScenes-Text dataset, which augments the established nuScenes dataset with rich textual annotations for every scene, demonstrating the positive impact of utilizing VLM on trajectory prediction.

In that regard, the widely adopted Model-Free RL (MFRL) promises to solve decision-making tasks in connected AVs (CAVs), contingent on the readiness of a significant amount of data samples for training. Nevertheless, it might be infeasible in practice and possibly lead to learning instability. In contrast, Model-Based RL (MBRL) manifests itself in sample-efficient learning, but the asymptotic performance of MBRL might lag behind the state-of-the-art MFRL algorithms. Furthermore, most studies for CAVs are limited to the decision-making of a single AV only, thus underscoring the performance due to the absence of communications. In this study, we try to address the decision-making problem of multiple CAVs with limited communications and propose a decentralized Multi-Agent Probabilistic Ensembles with Trajectory Sampling algorithm MA-PETS. In particular, in order to better capture the uncertainty of the unknown environment, MA-PETS leverages Probabilistic Ensemble (PE) neural networks to learn from communicated samples among neighboring CAVs. Afterwards, MA-PETS capably develops Trajectory Sampling (TS)-based model-predictive control for decision-making. On this basis, we derive the multi-agent group regret bound affected by the number of agents within the communication range and mathematically validate that incorporating effective information exchange among agents into the multi-agent learning scheme contributes to reducing the group regret bound in the worst case. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the superiority of MA-PETS in terms of the sample efficiency comparable to MFBL.</p></details> |  |

As the general communication network cannot meet the emergency requirements, in this paper we study the multi-UAV enabled wireless emergency communication system. Our goal is to maximize the capacity with jointly optimizing trajectory and allocating power. To tackle this non-convex optimization problem, we first decompose it into two sub-problems to optimize the trajectory and power allocation, respectively. Then, we propose the successive convex approximation technique and the block coordinate update algorithm to solve the two subproblems. The approximate optimal solution can be obtained after continuous iterations. Simulation results show that the capacity can be greatly increased using our proposed joint trajectory optimization and power allocation.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Progressive Pretext Task Learning for Human Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11588v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trajectory prediction is a practical task of predicting the future positions of pedestrians on the road, which typically covers all temporal ranges from short-term to long-term within a trajectory. However, existing works attempt to address the entire trajectory prediction with a singular, uniform training paradigm, neglecting the distinction between short-term and long-term dynamics in human trajectories. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel Progressive Pretext Task learning (PPT) framework, which progressively enhances the model's capacity of capturing short-term dynamics and long-term dependencies for the final entire trajectory prediction. Specifically, we elaborately design three stages of training tasks in the PPT framework. In the first stage, the model learns to comprehend the short-term dynamics through a stepwise next-position prediction task. In the second stage, the model is further enhanced to understand long-term dependencies through a destination prediction task. In the final stage, the model aims to address the entire future trajectory task by taking full advantage of the knowledge from previous stages. To alleviate the knowledge forgetting, we further apply a cross-task knowledge distillation. Additionally, we design a Transformer-based trajectory predictor, which is able to achieve highly efficient two-step reasoning by integrating a destination-driven prediction strategy and a group of learnable prompt embeddings. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks have demonstrated that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.

By leveraging natural language processing techniques, this study introduces the Scientific Concept Navigator (SciConNav), an embedding-based navigation model to infer the "knowledge pathway" from the research trajectories of millions of scholars. We validate that the learned representations effectively delineate disciplinary boundaries and capture the intricate relationships between diverse concepts. The utility of the inferred navigation space is showcased through multiple applications. Firstly, we demonstrated the multi-step analogy inferences within the knowledge space and the interconnectivity between concepts in different disciplines. Secondly, we formulated the attribute dimensions of knowledge across domains, observing the distributional shifts in the arrangement of 19 disciplines along these conceptual dimensions, including "Theoretical" to "Applied", and "Chemical" to "Biomedical', highlighting the evolution of functional attributes within knowledge domains. Lastly, by analyzing the high-dimensional knowledge network structure, we found that knowledge connects with shorter global pathways, and interdisciplinary knowledge plays a critical role in the accessibility of the global knowledge network. Our framework offers a novel approach to mining knowledge inheritance pathways in extensive scientific literature, which is of great significance for understanding scientific progression patterns, tailoring scientific learning trajectories, and accelerating scientific progress.</p></details> | <details><summary>21pag...</summary><p>21pages, 13 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Recent methods predict sub-goals on constructed topology map at each step to enable long-term action planning. However, they suffer from high computational cost when attempting to support such high-level predictions with GCN-like models. In this work, we propose an alternative method that facilitates navigation planning by considering the alignment between instructions and directed fidelity trajectories, which refers to a path from the initial node to the candidate locations on a directed graph without detours. This planning strategy leads to an efficient model while achieving strong performance. Specifically, we introduce a directed graph to illustrate the explored area of the environment, emphasizing directionality. Then, we firstly define the trajectory representation as a sequence of directed edge features, which are extracted from the panorama based on the corresponding orientation. Ultimately, we assess and compare the alignment between instruction and different trajectories during navigation to determine the next navigation target. Our method outperforms previous SOTA method BEVBert on RxR dataset and is comparable on R2R dataset while largely reducing the computational cost.

We aim to learn temporal latent representations of the underlying generative process that explain the observed patient disease trajectories in an interpretable and comprehensive way. To enhance the interpretability of these latent temporal processes, we develop a semi-supervised approach for disentangling the latent space using established medical knowledge. By combining the generative approach with medical definitions of different characteristics of SSc, we facilitate the discovery of new aspects of the disease. We show that the learned temporal latent processes can be utilized for further data analysis and clinical hypothesis testing, including finding similar patients and clustering SSc patient trajectories into novel sub-types. Moreover, our method enables personalized online monitoring and prediction of multivariate time series with uncertainty quantification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Machine Learning for Healthcare 2024. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2311.08149</p></details> |

The system uses readily accessible information from customer smartphones and retail apps, including motion data, store maps, and purchase records. This eliminates the need for additional hardware installations/maintenance and ensures customers full data control. Specifically, RetailOpt first uses inertial navigation to recover relative trajectories from smartphone motion data. The store map and purchase records are cross-referenced to identify a list of visited shelves, providing anchors to localize the relative trajectories in a store through continuous and discrete optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in five diverse environments. The system, if successful, would produce accurate customer movement data, essential for a broad range of retail applications including customer behavior analysis and in-store navigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Tracking for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in 3D Spaces under Motion Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10837v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article presents a three-dimensional nonlinear trajectory tracking control strategy for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the presence of spatial constraints. As opposed to many existing control strategies, which do not consider spatial constraints, the proposed strategy considers spatial constraints on each degree of freedom movement of the UAV. Such consideration makes the design appealing for many practical applications, such as pipeline inspection, boundary tracking, etc. The proposed design accounts for the limited information about the inertia matrix, thereby affirming its inherent robustness against unmodeled dynamics and other imperfections. We rigorously show that the UAV will converge to its desired path by maintaining bounded position, orientation, and linear and angular speeds. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy through various numerical simulations.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by the pivotal role trajectory length plays in the training process, we introduce Ada-NAV, a novel adaptive trajectory length scheme designed to enhance the training sample efficiency of RL algorithms in robotic navigation tasks. Unlike traditional approaches that treat trajectory length as a fixed hyperparameter, we propose to dynamically adjust it based on the entropy of the underlying navigation policy. Interestingly, Ada-NAV can be applied to both existing on-policy and off-policy RL methods, which we demonstrate by empirically validating its efficacy on three popular RL methods: REINFORCE, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). We demonstrate through simulated and real-world robotic experiments that Ada-NAV outperforms conventional methods that employ constant or randomly sampled trajectory lengths. Specifically, for a fixed sample budget, Ada-NAV achieves an 18\% increase in navigation success rate, a 20-38\% reduction in navigation path length, and a 9.32\% decrease in elevation costs. Furthermore, we showcase the versatility of Ada-NAV by integrating it with the Clearpath Husky robot, illustrating its applicability in complex outdoor environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Strengthening attacks and uncovering vulnerabilities, especially common issues in VLP models (e.g., high transferable AEs), can advance reliable and practical VLP models. A recent work (i.e., Set-level guidance attack) indicates that augmenting image-text pairs to increase AE diversity along the optimization path enhances the transferability of adversarial examples significantly. However, this approach predominantly emphasizes diversity around the online adversarial examples (i.e., AEs in the optimization period), leading to the risk of overfitting the victim model and affecting the transferability. In this study, we posit that the diversity of adversarial examples towards the clean input and online AEs are both pivotal for enhancing transferability across VLP models. Consequently, we propose using diversification along the intersection region of adversarial trajectory to expand the diversity of AEs. To fully leverage the interaction between modalities, we introduce text-guided adversarial example selection during optimization. Furthermore, to further mitigate the potential overfitting, we direct the adversarial text deviating from the last intersection region along the optimization path, rather than adversarial images as in existing methods. Extensive experiments affirm the effectiveness of our method in improving transferability across various VLP models and downstream vision-and-language tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV2...</summary><p>ECCV2024.

This work introduces a novel approach that combines RL with trajectory optimization to manage this trade-off effectively. Our approach embeds safety constraints within the action space of a modified Markov Decision Process (MDP). The RL agent produces a sequence of actions that are transformed into safe trajectories by a trajectory optimizer, thereby effectively ensuring safety and increasing training stability. This novel approach excels in its performance on challenging Safety Gym tasks, achieving significantly higher rewards and near-zero safety violations during inference. The method's real-world applicability is demonstrated through a safe and effective deployment in a real robot task of box-pushing around obstacles.</p></details> |  |

However, generating factually consistent responses in knowledge-intensive scenarios remains a challenge due to issues such as hallucination, difficulty in acquiring long-tailed knowledge, and limited memory expansion. This paper introduces SMART, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages external knowledge to enhance the interpretability and factual consistency of LLM-generated responses. SMART comprises four specialized agents, each performing a specific sub-trajectory action to navigate complex knowledge-intensive tasks. We propose a multi-agent co-training paradigm, Long- and Short-Trajectory Learning, which ensures synergistic collaboration among agents while maintaining fine-grained execution by each agent. Extensive experiments on 5 tasks demonstrate SMART's superior performance compared to previous widely adopted methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating 6-D Trajectories for Omnidirectional Multirotor Aerial Vehicles in Cluttered Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10392v2)** | 2024-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As fully-actuated systems, omnidirectional multirotor aerial vehicles (OMAVs) have more flexible maneuverability and advantages in aggressive flight in cluttered environments than traditional underactuated MAVs. %Due to the high dimensionality of configuration space, making the designed trajectory generation algorithm efficient is challenging. This paper aims to achieve safe flight of OMAVs in cluttered environments. Considering existing static obstacles, an efficient optimization-based framework is proposed to generate 6-D $SE(3)$ trajectories for OMAVs. Given the kinodynamic constraints and the 3D collision-free region represented by a series of intersecting convex polyhedra, the proposed method finally generates a safe and dynamically feasible 6-D trajectory. First, we parameterize the vehicle's attitude into a free 3D vector using stereographic projection to eliminate the constraints inherent in the $SO(3)$ manifold, while the complete $SE(3)$ trajectory is represented as a 6-D polynomial in time without inherent constraints. The vehicle's shape is modeled as a cuboid attached to the body frame to achieve whole-body collision evaluation. Then, we formulate the origin trajectory generation problem as a constrained optimization problem. The original constrained problem is finally transformed into an unconstrained one that can be solved efficiently. To verify the proposed framework's performance, simulations and real-world experiments based on a tilt-rotor hexarotor aerial vehicle are carried out.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

Existing physics-informed neural networks often emphasize short-term physics constraints, leaving the proper preservation of long-term conservation less explored. We introduce Neural Characteristic Trajectory Fields, a novel representation utilizing Eulerian neural fields to implicitly model Lagrangian fluid trajectories. This topology-free, auto-differentiable representation facilitates efficient flow map calculations between arbitrary frames as well as efficient velocity extraction via auto-differentiation. Consequently, it enables end-to-end supervision covering long-term conservation and short-term physics priors. Building on the representation, we propose physics-informed trajectory learning and integration into NeRF-based scene reconstruction. We enable advanced obstacle handling through self-supervised scene decomposition and seamless integrated boundary constraints.

| **[Towards Personalised Patient Risk Prediction Using Temporal Hospital Data Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09373v1)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantifying a patient's health status provides clinicians with insight into patient risk, and the ability to better triage and manage resources. Early Warning Scores (EWS) are widely deployed to measure overall health status, and risk of adverse outcomes, in hospital patients. However, current EWS are limited both by their lack of personalisation and use of static observations. We propose a pipeline that groups intensive care unit patients by the trajectories of observations data throughout their stay as a basis for the development of personalised risk predictions. Feature importance is considered to provide model explainability. Using the MIMIC-IV dataset, six clusters were identified, capturing differences in disease codes, observations, lengths of admissions and outcomes. Applying the pipeline to data from just the first four hours of each ICU stay assigns the majority of patients to the same cluster as when the entire stay duration is considered. In-hospital mortality prediction models trained on individual clusters had higher F1 score performance in five of the six clusters when compared against the unclustered patient cohort. The pipeline could form the basis of a clinical decision support tool, working to improve the clinical characterisation of risk groups and the early detection of patient deterioration.</p></details> |  |

Location-Based Services (LBS) capitalize on this trajectory data to offer users personalized services tailored to their location information. However, this trajectory data contains sensitive information about users' movement patterns and habits, necessitating confidentiality and protection from unknown collectors. To address this challenge, privacy-preserving methods like K-anonymity and Differential Privacy have been proposed to safeguard private information in the dataset. Despite their effectiveness, these methods can impact the original features by introducing perturbations or generating unrealistic trajectory data, leading to suboptimal performance in downstream tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Federated Variational AutoEncoder (FedVAE) approach, which effectively generates a new trajectory dataset while preserving the confidentiality of private information and retaining the structure of the original features. In addition, FedVAE leverages Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) to maintain the original feature space and generate new trajectory data, and incorporates Federated Learning (FL) during the training stage, ensuring that users' data remains locally stored to protect their personal information. The results demonstrate its superior performance compared to other existing methods, affirming FedVAE as a promising solution for enhancing data privacy and utility in location-based applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>2023 ...</summary><p>2023 IEEE 98th Vehicular Technology Conference</p></details> |

However, the high cost of collecting demonstration data is a significant bottleneck. Videos, as a rich data source, contain knowledge of behaviors, physics, and semantics, but extracting control-specific information from them is challenging due to the lack of action labels. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, Any-point Trajectory Modeling (ATM), that utilizes video demonstrations by pre-training a trajectory model to predict future trajectories of arbitrary points within a video frame. Once trained, these trajectories provide detailed control guidance, enabling the learning of robust visuomotor policies with minimal action-labeled data. Across over 130 language-conditioned tasks we evaluated in both simulation and the real world, ATM outperforms strong video pre-training baselines by 80% on average. Furthermore, we show effective transfer learning of manipulation skills from human videos and videos from a different robot morphology.

A novel energy function optimization-based framework is proposed to generate prediction trajectories. Firstly, a new energy function is designed for easier optimization. Secondly, an online optimization pipeline for calculating parameters and agents' velocities is developed. In this pipeline, we first design an efficient group division method based on Frechet distance to classify agents online. Then the strategy on decoupling the optimization of velocities and critical parameters in the energy function is developed, where the the slap swarm algorithm and gradient descent algorithms are integrated to solve the optimization problems more efficiently. Thirdly, we propose a similarity-based resample evaluation algorithm to predict agents' optimal goals, defined as the target-moving headings of agents, which effectively extracts hidden information in observed states and avoids learning agents' destinations via the training dataset in advance. Experiments and comparison studies verify the advantages of the proposed method in terms of prediction accuracy and speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[ImageFlowNet: Forecasting Multiscale Trajectories of Disease Progression with Irregularly-Sampled Longitudinal Medical Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14794v3)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The forecasting of disease progression from images is a holy grail for clinical decision making. However, this task is complicated by the inherent high dimensionality, temporal sparsity and sampling irregularity in longitudinal image acquisitions. Existing methods often rely on extracting hand-crafted features and performing time-series analysis in this vector space, leading to a loss of rich spatial information within the images. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ImageFlowNet, a novel framework that learns latent-space flow fields that evolve multiscale representations in joint embedding spaces using neural ODEs and SDEs to model disease progression in the image domain. Notably, ImageFlowNet learns multiscale joint representation spaces by combining cohorts of patients together so that information can be transferred between the patient samples. The dynamics then provide plausible trajectories of progression, with the SDE providing alternative trajectories from the same starting point. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We then demonstrate ImageFlowNet's effectiveness through empirical evaluations on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in retinal geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixed...</summary><p>Fixed some typos.

| **[Adaptive Human Trajectory Prediction via Latent Corridors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06653v2)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trajectory prediction is typically posed as a zero-shot generalization problem: a predictor is learnt on a dataset of human motion in training scenes, and then deployed on unseen test scenes. While this paradigm has yielded tremendous progress, it fundamentally assumes that trends in human behavior within the deployment scene are constant over time. As such, current prediction models are unable to adapt to scene-specific transient human behaviors, such as crowds temporarily gathering to see buskers, pedestrians hurrying through the rain and avoiding puddles, or a protest breaking out. We formalize the problem of scene-specific adaptive trajectory prediction and propose a new adaptation approach inspired by prompt tuning called latent corridors. By augmenting the input of any pre-trained human trajectory predictor with learnable image prompts, the predictor can improve in the deployment scene by inferring trends from extremely small amounts of new data (e.g., 2 humans observed for 30 seconds). With less than 0.1% additional model parameters, we see up to 23.9% ADE improvement in MOTSynth simulated data and 16.4% ADE in MOT and Wildtrack real pedestrian data. Qualitatively, we observe that latent corridors imbue predictors with an awareness of scene geometry and scene-specific human behaviors that non-adaptive predictors struggle to capture.

They can be considered to be simplified traffic flow maps, whereas the computational challenges in aggregating small scale traffic flows prevent the wider dissemination of high resolution flow maps. Vehicle trajectories are a promising data source to solve this challenging problem. The solution begins with the alignment (or map matching) of the trajectories to the road network. However even the state-of-the-art map matching implementations produce sub-optimal results with small misalignments. While these misalignments are negligible for large scale flow aggregation in desire line maps, they pose substantial obstacles for small scale flow aggregation in high resolution maps. To remove these remaining misalignments, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. With each local alignment iteration, the misalignments of the trajectories with each other and with the road network are reduced, and so converge closer to a minimal flow map. By analysing a set of empirical trajectories collected in Hannover, Germany, we confirm that our minimal flow map has high levels of spatial resolution, accuracy and coverage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Path Long-Term Vessel Trajectories Forecasting with Probabilistic Feature Fusion for Problem Shifting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18948v6)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenge of boosting the precision of multi-path long-term vessel trajectory forecasting on engineered sequences of Automatic Identification System (AIS) data using feature fusion for problem shifting. We have developed a deep auto-encoder model and a phased framework approach to predict the next 12 hours of vessel trajectories using 1 to 3 hours of AIS data as input. To this end, we fuse the spatiotemporal features from the AIS messages with probabilistic features engineered from historical AIS data referring to potential routes and destinations. As a result, we reduce the forecasting uncertainty by shifting the problem into a trajectory reconstruction problem. The probabilistic features have an F1-Score of approximately 85% and 75% for the vessel route and destination prediction, respectively. Under such circumstances, we achieved an R2 Score of over 98% with different layer structures and varying feature combinations; the high R2 Score is a natural outcome of the well-defined shipping lanes in the study region. However, our proposal stands out among competing approaches as it demonstrates the capability of complex decision-making during turnings and route selection. Furthermore, we have shown that our model achieves more accurate forecasting with average and median errors of 11km and 6km, respectively, a 25% improvement from the current state-of-the-art approaches. The resulting model from this proposal is deployed as part of a broader Decision Support System to safeguard whales by preventing the risk of vessel-whale collisions under the smartWhales initiative and acting on the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Atlantic Canada.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we present an exploration-based trajectory optimization approach, referred to as ETO. This learning method is designed to enhance the performance of open LLM agents. Contrary to previous studies that exclusively train on successful expert trajectories, our method allows agents to learn from their exploration failures. This leads to improved performance through an iterative optimization framework. During the exploration phase, the agent interacts with the environment while completing given tasks, gathering failure trajectories to create contrastive trajectory pairs. In the subsequent training phase, the agent utilizes these trajectory preference pairs to update its policy using contrastive learning methods like DPO. This iterative cycle of exploration and training fosters continued improvement in the agents. Our experiments on three complex tasks demonstrate that ETO consistently surpasses baseline performance by a large margin. Furthermore, an examination of task-solving efficiency and potential in scenarios lacking expert trajectory underscores the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2024 Main Conference; Camera Ready</p></details> |

For instance, the intricate flying behavior of migratory birds hinges on their analysis of environmental cues such as wind direction and air pressure. However, the diverse and dynamic nature of contextual information renders it an arduous task for AI models to comprehend its impact on trajectories and consequently predict them accurately. To address this issue, we propose a ``manager-worker'' framework to unleash the full potential of contextual information and construct CATP model, an implementation of the framework for Context-Aware Trajectory Prediction. The framework comprises a manager model, several worker models, and a tailored training mechanism inspired by competition symbiosis in nature. Taking CATP as an example, each worker needs to compete against others for training data and develop an advantage in predicting specific moving patterns. The manager learns the workers' performance in different contexts and selects the best one in the given context to predict trajectories, enabling CATP as a whole to operate in a symbiotic manner. We conducted two comparative experiments and an ablation study to quantitatively evaluate the proposed framework and CATP model. The results showed that CATP could outperform SOTA models, and the framework could be generalized to different context-aware tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a holistic framework that jointly optimizes the total latency and energy consumption for UAV-assisted fog computing in a three-dimensional spatial domain with varying terrain elevations and dynamic task generations. Our proposed framework considers three important and interdependent modules: attitude control, trajectory planning, and task assignment. We first establish a fuzzy proportional-integral-derivative control model to determine the UAV's attitude. Then, we propose an enhanced Ant Colony System (ACS) based algorithm, that includes a safety value and a decoupling mechanism to overcome the convergence issue in classical ACS, to compute the optimal UAV trajectory. Finally, we design an algorithm based on the Particle Swarm Optimization technique, to determine where each offloaded task should be executed. Under our proposed framework, the outcome of one module would affect the decision-making in one other, providing a holistic perspective of the system and thus leading to improved solutions. We demonstrate by extensive simulation results that our proposed framework can significantly improve the overall performance, measured by latency and energy consumption, compared to existing baseline approaches.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |

Our goal is to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) match human-like paths while navigating in crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We use VLMs and a visual prompting approach with their zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our methods in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe at least 3.35% improvement in the traversability and 20.61% improvement in terms of human-like navigation in generated trajectories in challenging outdoor navigation scenarios, such as sidewalks, crosswalks, etc.</p></details> |  |

Such manoeuvring flight envelope variations, governed by the aircraft's complex nonlinear dynamics, are unpredictable by pilots and existing flight management systems. To prevent in-flight Loss of Control, post-failure trajectories must be optimal, planned in real-time, avoid terrain, and adhere to the impaired aircraft's reduced manoeuvrability and dynamic constraints. This paper presents a novel real-time trajectory optimization method for impaired aircraft based on a combination of differential flatness theory, the pseudospectral method, nonlinear programming, and inverse dynamics. In the proposed method, which utilizes a high-fidelity nonlinear six degree-of-freedom model, to conform to aircraft's altered dynamics a sequence of trim points is selected from the impaired aircraft's manoeuvring flight envelope based on the chosen optimization criteria, ensuring that the resulting three-dimensional trajectory observes terrain avoidance. Then, the required control inputs are obtained for each manoeuvre in less than a second. The method is applied to the NASA Generic Transport Model with rudder failure near a complex mountainous terrain. Both an optimal one-piece trajectory and a near-optimal piecewise path consisting of several optimal trajectories, are generated in non-real-time and real-time, respectively, and compared. Results show that the near-optimal real-time trajectory retains up to 80% of the optimality.</p></details> | <details><summary>56 pa...</summary><p>56 pages, 21 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[LC-LLM: Explainable Lane-Change Intention and Trajectory Predictions with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18344v2)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To ensure safe driving in dynamic environments, autonomous vehicles should possess the capability to accurately predict lane change intentions of surrounding vehicles in advance and forecast their future trajectories. Existing motion prediction approaches have ample room for improvement, particularly in terms of long-term prediction accuracy and interpretability. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing LC-LLM, an explainable lane change prediction model that leverages the strong reasoning capabilities and self-explanation abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Essentially, we reformulate the lane change prediction task as a language modeling problem, processing heterogeneous driving scenario information as natural language prompts for LLMs and employing supervised fine-tuning to tailor LLMs specifically for lane change prediction task. Additionally, we finetune the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve prediction transparency and reliability, and include explanatory requirements in the prompts during inference stage. Therefore, our LC-LLM model not only predicts lane change intentions and trajectories but also provides CoT reasoning and explanations for its predictions, enhancing its interpretability. Extensive experiments based on the large-scale highD dataset demonstrate the superior performance and interpretability of our LC-LLM in lane change prediction task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize LLMs for predicting lane change behavior. Our study shows that LLMs can effectively encode comprehensive interaction information for driving behavior understanding.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

Due to a large amount of variability in brain anatomy between different individuals, we hypothesize that leveraging MRI time series can help improve specificity, by treating each patient as their own baseline. Here we turn to conditional variational autoencoders to generate individualized MRI predictions given the subject's age, disease status and one previous scan. Using serial imaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we train a novel architecture to build a latent space distribution which can be sampled from to generate future predictions of changing anatomy. This enables us to extrapolate beyond the dataset and predict MRIs up to 10 years. We evaluated the model on a held-out set from ADNI and an independent dataset (from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies). By comparing to several alternatives, we show that our model produces more individualized images with higher resolution. Further, if an individual already has a follow-up MRI, we demonstrate a usage of our model to compute a likelihood ratio classifier for disease status. In practice, the model may be able to assist in early diagnosis of AD and provide a counterfactual baseline trajectory for treatment effect estimation. Furthermore, it generates a synthetic dataset that can potentially be used for downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI 2024 LDTM workshop</p></details> |

In particular, the tasks of different types and service requirements in MEC network are offloaded from one UAV to another. To pursue the goal of low-carbon edge computing, we study the problem of minimizing system energy consumption by jointly optimizing computation resource allocation, task scheduling, service placement, and UAV trajectories. Considering the inherent unpredictability associated with task generation and the dynamic nature of wireless fading channels, addressing this problem presents a significant challenge. To overcome this issue, we reformulate the complicated non-convex problem as a Markov decision process and propose a soft actor-critic-based trajectory optimization and resource allocation algorithm to implement a flexible learning strategy. Numerical results illustrate that within a multi-UAV-enabled MEC network, the proposed algorithm effectively reduces the system energy consumption in heterogeneous tasks and services scenarios compared to other baseline solutions.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |

In the past, relatively simple physics-motivated priors have been considered for such approaches, using assumptions such as constant velocity or acceleration. This paper presents an approach to incorporating exogenous control inputs, such as velocity or acceleration commands, into the continuous Gaussian process state-estimation framework. It is shown that this approach generalizes across different domains in robotics, making it applicable to both the estimation of continuous-time trajectories for mobile robots and continuum-robot shapes. Results show that incorporating control inputs leads to more informed priors, potentially requiring less measurements and estimation nodes to obtain accurate estimates.

In this study, we focus on a scenario where a connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) serves as the central agent, utilizing both sensors and communication technologies to perceive its surrounding traffics consisting of autonomous vehicles (AVs), connected vehicles (CVs), and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Our trajectory prediction task is aimed at all the detected surrounding vehicles. To effectively integrate the multi-source data from both sensor and communication technologies, we propose a deep learning framework called MSMA utilizing a cross-attention module for multi-source data fusion. Vector map data is utilized to provide contextual information. The trajectory dataset is collected in CARLA simulator with synthesized data errors introduced. Numerical experiments demonstrate that in a mixed traffic flow scenario, the integration of data from different sources enhances our understanding of the environment. This notably improves trajectory prediction accuracy, particularly in situations with a high CV market penetration rate. The code is available at: https://github.com/xichennn/MSMA.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid advancement in connected technologies, such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, valuable information from alternate views becomes accessible via wireless networks. The integration of information from alternative views has the potential to overcome the inherent limitations associated with a single viewpoint, such as occlusions and limited field of view. In this work, we introduce V2INet, a novel trajectory prediction framework designed to model multi-view data by extending existing single-view models. Unlike previous approaches where the multi-view data is manually fused or formulated as a separate training stage, our model supports end-to-end training, enhancing both flexibility and performance. Moreover, the predicted multimodal trajectories are calibrated by a post-hoc conformal prediction module to get valid and efficient confidence regions. We evaluated the entire framework using the real-world V2I dataset V2X-Seq. Our results demonstrate superior performance in terms of Final Displacement Error (FDE) and Miss Rate (MR) using a single GPU.

However, the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) are based on supervised deep learning - which leads to challenges when the distribution of trajectories changes due to such a shock. We provide a neuro-symbolic rule-based framework to conduct error correction and detection of these models to integrate into our movement trajectory platform. We provide a suite of experiments on several recent SOTA models where we show highly accurate error detection, the ability to improve accuracy with a changing test distribution, and accuracy improvement for the base use case in addition to a suite of theoretical properties that informed algorithm development. Specifically, we show an F1 scores for predicting errors of up to 0.984, significant performance increase for out-of distribution accuracy (8.51% improvement over SOTA for zero-shot accuracy), and accuracy improvement over the SOTA model.</p></details> |  |

To tackle these challenges, we introduce Optimal Gaussian Diffusion (OGD) and Estimated Clean Manifold (ECM) Guidance. OGD optimizes the prior distribution for a small diffusion time $T$ and starts the reverse diffusion process from it. ECM directly injects guidance gradients to the estimated clean manifold, eliminating extensive gradient backpropagation throughout the network. Our methodology streamlines the generative process, enabling practical applications with reduced computational overhead. Experimental validation on the large-scale Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrates our approach's superior performance, offering a viable solution for computationally efficient, high-quality joint trajectory prediction and controllable generation for autonomous driving.

In this process, the complexity of algorithms used for vehicle control has grown significantly. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a prominent example, which has gained enormous popularity and is now widely used for vehicle motion planning and control. However, safety concerns constrain its practical application, especially since traditional procedures of functional safety (FS), with its universal standard ISO26262, reach their limits. Concomitantly, the new aspect of safety-of-the-intended-function (SOTIF) has moved into the center of attention, whose standard, ISO21448, has only been released in 2022. Thus, experience with SOTIF is low and few case studies are available in industry and research. Hence this paper aims to make two main contributions: (1) an analysis of the SOTIF for a generic MPC-based trajectory planner and (2) an interpretation and concrete application of the generic procedures described in ISO21448 for determining functional insufficiencies (FIs) and triggering conditions (TCs). Particular novelties of the paper include an approach for the out-of-context development of SOTIF-related elements (SOTIF-EooC), a compilation of important FIs and TCs for a MPC-based trajectory planner, and an optimized safety concept based on the identified FIs and TCs for the MPC-based trajectory planner.</p></details> | Extended Version |

We propose an expression exploration framework based on deep symbolic regression (DSR) integrated with a variable intersection selection (VIS) method to find variable combinations that encourage interpretable and parsimonious mathematical expressions. In the exploration learning process, two penalty terms are added to improve the reward function: (i) a complexity penalty to regulate the complexity of the explored expressions to be parsimonious, and (ii) a variable interaction penalty to encourage the expression exploration to focus on variable combinations that can best describe the data. We show the performance of the proposed method to learn several car-following dynamics models and discuss its limitations and future research directions.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, the potential of transformer-based diffusion models for effectively generating videos with controllable motion remains an area of limited exploration. This paper introduces Tora, the first trajectory-oriented DiT framework that integrates textual, visual, and trajectory conditions concurrently for video generation. Specifically, Tora consists of a Trajectory Extractor~(TE), a Spatial-Temporal DiT, and a Motion-guidance Fuser~(MGF). The TE encodes arbitrary trajectories into hierarchical spacetime motion patches with a 3D video compression network. The MGF integrates the motion patches into the DiT blocks to generate consistent videos following trajectories. Our design aligns seamlessly with DiT's scalability, allowing precise control of video content's dynamics with diverse durations, aspect ratios, and resolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate Tora's excellence in achieving high motion fidelity, while also meticulously simulating the movement of the physical world.

Learning-based approaches for multi-agent trajectory prediction, such as primarily relying on graph neural networks, graph transformers, and hypergraph neural networks, have demonstrated outstanding performance on real-world datasets in recent years. However, the hypergraph transformer-based method for trajectory prediction is yet to be explored. Therefore, we present a MultiscAle Relational Transformer (MART) network for multi-agent trajectory prediction. MART is a hypergraph transformer architecture to consider individual and group behaviors in transformer machinery. The core module of MART is the encoder, which comprises a Pair-wise Relational Transformer (PRT) and a Hyper Relational Transformer (HRT). The encoder extends the capabilities of a relational transformer by introducing HRT, which integrates hyperedge features into the transformer mechanism, promoting attention weights to focus on group-wise relations. In addition, we propose an Adaptive Group Estimator (AGE) designed to infer complex group relations in real-world environments. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets (NBA, SDD, and ETH-UCY) demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, enhancing ADE/FDE by 3.9%/11.8% on the NBA dataset.

Due to the intractable growth of non-convex constraints with the number of agents, exploring various homotopy classes that imply different convex domains, is crucial for finding a feasible solution. However, existing methods struggle to explore various homotopy classes efficiently due to combining it with time-consuming precise trajectory solution finding. CSDO, addresses this limitation by separating them into different levels and integrating an efficient Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithm to search homotopy classes. It first searches for a coarse initial guess using a large search step, identifying a specific homotopy class. Subsequent decentralized Quadratic Programming (QP) refinement processes this guess, resolving minor collisions efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that CSDO outperforms existing MVTP algorithms in large-scale, high-density scenarios, achieving up to 95% success rate in 50m $\times$ 50m random scenarios around one second.

We introduce the Enhanced Transformer for Health Outcome Simulation (ETHOS), a novel application of the transformer deep-learning architecture for analyzing high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and episodic health data. ETHOS is trained using Patient Health Timelines (PHTs)-detailed, tokenized records of health events-to predict future health trajectories, leveraging a zero-shot learning approach. ETHOS represents a significant advancement in foundation model development for healthcare analytics, eliminating the need for labeled data and model fine-tuning. Its ability to simulate various treatment pathways and consider patient-specific factors positions ETHOS as a tool for care optimization and addressing biases in healthcare delivery. Future developments will expand ETHOS' capabilities to incorporate a wider range of data types and data sources.

Forward application of the model yields so called imagined trajectories (sequences of action, predicted state-reward) used to optimize the set of candidate actions that maximize expected reward. The outcome, an ideal imagined trajectory or plan, is imperfect and typically MBRL relies on model predictive control (MPC) to overcome this by continuously re-planning from scratch, incurring thus major computational cost and increasing complexity in tasks with longer receding horizon. We propose uncertainty estimation methods for online evaluation of imagined trajectories to assess whether further planned actions can be trusted to deliver acceptable reward. These methods include comparing the error after performing the last action with the standard expected error and using model uncertainty to assess the deviation from expected outcomes. Additionally, we introduce methods that exploit the forward propagation of the dynamics model to evaluate if the remainder of the plan aligns with expected results and assess the remainder of the plan in terms of the expected reward. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed uncertainty estimation methods by applying them to avoid unnecessary trajectory replanning in a shooting MBRL setting. Results highlight significant reduction on computational costs without sacrificing performance.</p></details> |  |

Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC)-based planners provide non-conservative planning, but do not rule out a (small) probability of collision. We propose a control scheme that yields an efficient trajectory based on SMPC when the traffic scenario allows, still avoiding that the vehicle causes collisions with traffic participants if the latter move according to the prediction assumptions. If some traffic participant does not behave as anticipated, no safety guarantee can be given. Then, our approach yields a trajectory which minimizes the probability of collision, using Constraint Violation Probability Minimization techniques. Our algorithm can also be adapted to minimize the anticipated harm caused by a collision. We provide a thorough discussion of the benefits of our novel control scheme and compare it to a previous approach through numerical simulations from the CommonRoad database.</p></details> |  |

However, efficiently capturing the true trajectory distribution with a compact set is challenging. In this work, we propose a novel approach for generating scene-specific trajectory sets that better represent the diversity and admissibility of future actor behavior. Our method constructs multiple trajectory sets tailored to different scene contexts, such as intersections and non-intersections, by leveraging map information and actor dynamics. We introduce a deterministic goal sampling algorithm that identifies relevant map regions and generates trajectories conditioned on the scene layout. Furthermore, we empirically investigate various sampling strategies and set sizes to optimize the trade-off between coverage and diversity. Experiments on the Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrate that our scene-specific sets achieve higher plausibility while maintaining diversity compared to traditional single-set approaches. The proposed Recursive In-Distribution Subsampling (RIDS) method effectively condenses the representation space and outperforms metric-driven sampling in terms of trajectory admissibility. Our work highlights the benefits of scene-aware trajectory set generation for capturing the complex and heterogeneous nature of actor behavior in real-world driving scenarios.</p></details> |  |

The framework leverages the segmentable characteristic of trajectories and ensures consistency within the self-assigned segments. Intensive experiments were conducted on datasets from three different airports, totaling four datasets, comparing the learned representation's performance of downstream classification and clustering with other state-of-the-art representation learning techniques. The results show that ATSCC outperforms these methods by aligning with the labels defined by aeronautical procedures. ATSCC is adaptable to various airport configurations and scalable to incomplete trajectories. This research has expanded upon existing capabilities, achieving these improvements independently without predefined inputs such as airport configurations, maneuvering procedures, or labeled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures.

Typical stochastic mobility models, e.g., random waypoint model and Gauss Markov model, can hardly capture the distribution characteristics of users within real-world areas. State-of-the-art trace-based mobility models and existing learning-based trajectory generation methods, however, are frequently constrained by the inaccessibility of substantial real trajectories due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we harness the intrinsic correlation between street maps and trajectories and develop a novel zero-shot trajectory generation method, named Map2Traj, by exploiting the diffusion model. We incorporate street maps as a condition to consistently pilot the denoising process and train our model on diverse sets of real trajectories from various regions in Xi'an, China, and their corresponding street maps. With solely the street map of an unobserved area, Map2Traj generates synthetic trajectories that not only closely resemble the real-world mobility pattern but also offer comparable efficacy. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our proposed method on zero-shot trajectory generation tasks in terms of both trajectory and distribution similarities. In addition, a case study of employing Map2Traj in wireless network optimization is presented to validate its efficacy for downstream applications.</p></details> |  |

SAPI uses an abstract way to represent and encode surrounding environment by utilizing information from real-time map, right-of-way, and surrounding traffic. The proposed model consists of two convolutional network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN)-based encoders and one decoder. A refiner is proposed to conduct a look-back operation inside the model, in order to make full use of raw history trajectory information. We evaluate SAPI on a proprietary dataset collected in real-world intersections through autonomous vehicles. It is demonstrated that SAPI shows promising performance when predicting vehicle trajectories at intersection, and outperforms benchmark methods. The average displacement error(ADE) and final displacement error(FDE) for 6-second prediction are 1.84m and 4.32m respectively. We also show that the proposed model can accurately predict vehicle trajectories in different scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we propose a text-based trajectory generation model that attempts to address all three challenges while relying on only a handful of demonstration trajectory data. Our key idea is to leverage recent flow-based models capable of capturing complex conditional distributions, not directly in the high-dimensional trajectory space, but rather in the low-dimensional latent coordinate space of the motion manifold, with deliberately designed regularization terms to ensure smoothness of motions and robustness to text variations. We show that our {\it Motion Manifold Flow Primitive (MMFP)} framework can accurately generate qualitatively distinct motions for a wide range of text inputs, significantly outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, under review</p></details> |

Traditional methods usually perform holistic inference on the trajectories of agents, neglecting the differences in prediction difficulty among agents. This paper proposes a novel Difficulty-Guided Feature Enhancement Network (DGFNet), which leverages the prediction difficulty differences among agents for multi-agent trajectory prediction. Firstly, we employ spatio-temporal feature encoding and interaction to capture rich spatio-temporal features. Secondly, a difficulty-guided decoder is used to control the flow of future trajectories into subsequent modules, obtaining reliable future trajectories. Then, feature interaction and fusion are performed through the future feature interaction module. Finally, the fused agent features are fed into the final predictor to generate the predicted trajectory distributions for multiple participants. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Argoverse 1\&2 motion forecasting benchmarks. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each module. Moreover, compared with SOTA methods, our method balances trajectory prediction accuracy and real-time inference speed.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, with the increasing granularity and complexity of vehicle-generated data, the lack of data quality audits raises concerns about multi-party mistrust in trajectory prediction tasks. In response, this paper proposes an asynchronous federated learning data sharing method based on an interpretable reputation quantization mechanism utilizing graph neural network tools. Data providers share data structures under differential privacy constraints to ensure security while reducing redundant data. We implement deep reinforcement learning to categorize vehicles by reputation level, which optimizes the aggregation efficiency of federated learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed data sharing scheme not only reinforces the security of the trajectory prediction task but also enhances prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Human trajectory prediction is a noisy process, and no prediction does precisely match any future trajectory. It is therefore approached as a stochastic problem, where the goal is to minimise the error between the true and the predicted trajectory. In this work, we explore the application of metamorphic testing for human trajectory prediction. Metamorphic testing is designed to handle unclear or missing test oracles. It is well-designed for human trajectory prediction, where there is no clear criterion of correct or incorrect human behaviour. Metamorphic relations rely on transformations over source test cases and exploit invariants. A setting well-designed for human trajectory prediction where there are many symmetries of expected human behaviour under variations of the input, e.g. mirroring and rescaling of the input data. We discuss how metamorphic testing can be applied to stochastic human trajectory prediction and introduce the Wasserstein Violation Criterion to statistically assess whether a follow-up test case violates a label-preserving metamorphic relation.</p></details> | <details><summary>MET'2...</summary><p>MET'24: 9th ACM International Workshop on Metamorphic Testing</p></details> |

If the opposing vehicles do not react to the ego vehicle, they can be predicted accurately. However, if there is interaction between the vehicles, the prediction loses its validity. For high interaction, instead of a planning approach that reacts exclusively to the fixed prediction, a trajectory planning approach is required that incorporates the interaction with the opposing vehicles. This paper demonstrates the limitations of a widely used conventional sampling-based approach within a highly interactive blocking scenario. We show that high success rates are achieved for less aggressive blocking behavior but that the collision rate increases with more significant interaction. We further propose a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based trajectory planning approach for racing that explicitly exploits the interaction with the opposing vehicle without requiring a prediction. In contrast to the conventional approach, the RL-based approach achieves high success rates even for aggressive blocking behavior. Furthermore, we propose a novel safety layer (SL) that intervenes when the trajectory generated by the RL-based approach is infeasible. In that event, the SL generates a sub-optimal but feasible trajectory, avoiding termination of the scenario due to a not found valid solution.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, accepted to be published at the 27th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems, September 24 - 27, 2024, Edmonton, Canada</p></details> |
| **[Sampling-Based Hierarchical Trajectory Planning for Formation Flight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17392v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formation flight of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) poses significant challenges in terms of safety and formation keeping, particularly in cluttered environments. However, existing methods often struggle to simultaneously satisfy these two critical requirements. To address this issue, this paper proposes a sampling-based trajectory planning method with a hierarchical structure for formation flight in dense obstacle environments. To ensure reliable local sensing information sharing among UAVs, each UAV generates a safe flight corridor (SFC), which is transmitted to the leader UAV. Subsequently, a sampling-based formation guidance path generation method is designed as the front-end strategy, steering the formation to fly in the desired shape safely with the formation connectivity provided by the SFCs. Furthermore, a model predictive path integral (MPPI) based distributed trajectory optimization method is developed as the back-end part, which ensures the smoothness, safety and dynamics feasibility of the executable trajectory. To validate the efficiency of the developed algorithm, comprehensive simulation comparisons are conducted.

| **[Exploring Commercial Vehicle Detouring Patterns through the Application of Probe Trajectory Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17319v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding motorist detouring behavior is critical for both traffic operations and planning applications. However, measuring real-world detouring behavior is challenging due to the need to track the movement of individual vehicles. Recent developments in high-resolution vehicle trajectory data have enabled transportation professionals to observe real-world detouring behaviors without the need to install and maintain hardware such as license plate reading cameras. This paper investigates the feasibility of vehicle probe trajectory data to capture commercial motor vehicle (CMV) detouring behavior under three unique case studies. Before doing so, a validation analysis was conducted to investigate the ability of CMV probe trajectory data to represent overall CMV volumes at well-calibrated count stations near virtual weigh stations (VWS) in Maryland. The validation analysis showed strong positive correlations (above 0.75) at all VWS stations. Upon validating the data, a methodology was applied to assess CMV detour behaviors associated with CMV enforcement activities, congestion avoidance, and incident induced temporary road closures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting 2024.

| **[TLControl: Trajectory and Language Control for Human Motion Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17135v4)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controllable human motion synthesis is essential for applications in AR/VR, gaming and embodied AI. Existing methods often focus solely on either language or full trajectory control, lacking precision in synthesizing motions aligned with user-specified trajectories, especially for multi-joint control. To address these issues, we present TLControl, a novel method for realistic human motion synthesis, incorporating both low-level Trajectory and high-level Language semantics controls, through the integration of neural-based and optimization-based techniques. Specifically, we begin with training a VQ-VAE for a compact and well-structured latent motion space organized by body parts. We then propose a Masked Trajectories Transformer (MTT) for predicting a motion distribution conditioned on language and trajectory. Once trained, we use MTT to sample initial motion predictions given user-specified partial trajectories and text descriptions as conditioning. Finally, we introduce a test-time optimization to refine these coarse predictions for precise trajectory control, which offers flexibility by allowing users to specify various optimization goals and ensures high runtime efficiency. Comprehensive experiments show that TLControl significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in trajectory accuracy and time efficiency, making it practical for interactive and high-quality animation generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reacting on human stubbornness in human-machine trajectory planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17275v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, a method for a cooperative trajectory planning between a human and an automation is extended by a behavioral model of the human. This model can characterize the stubbornness of the human, which measures how strong the human adheres to his preferred trajectory. Accordingly, a static model is introduced indicating a link between the force in haptically coupled human-robot interactions and humans's stubbornness. The introduced stubbornness parameter enables an application-independent reaction of the automation for the cooperative trajectory planning. Simulation results in the context of human-machine cooperation in a care application show that the proposed behavioral model can quantitatively estimate the stubbornness of the interacting human, enabling a more targeted adaptation of the automation to the human behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-aware Multi-task Learning for Pedestrian Intent and Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17162v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of socially-aware autonomous vehicles hinges on precise modeling of human behavior. Within this broad paradigm, the specific challenge lies in accurately predicting pedestrian's trajectory and intention. Traditional methodologies have leaned heavily on historical trajectory data, frequently overlooking vital contextual cues such as pedestrian-specific traits and environmental factors. Furthermore, there's a notable knowledge gap as trajectory and intention prediction have largely been approached as separate problems, despite their mutual dependence. To bridge this gap, we introduce PTINet (Pedestrian Trajectory and Intention Prediction Network), which jointly learns the trajectory and intention prediction by combining past trajectory observations, local contextual features (individual pedestrian behaviors), and global features (signs, markings etc.). The efficacy of our approach is evaluated on widely used public datasets: JAAD and PIE, where it has demonstrated superior performance over existing state-of-the-art models in trajectory and intention prediction. The results from our experiments and ablation studies robustly validate PTINet's effectiveness in jointly exploring intention and trajectory prediction for pedestrian behaviour modelling. The experimental evaluation indicates the advantage of using global and local contextual features for pedestrian trajectory and intention prediction. The effectiveness of PTINet in predicting pedestrian behavior paves the way for the development of automated systems capable of seamlessly interacting with pedestrians in urban settings.</p></details> |  |

Although the specifications for transmitting and receiving AIS messages are fixed, it is well known that technical inaccuracies and lacking seafarer compliance lead to severe data quality impairment. This paper proposes an adaptable, data-driven, $\alpha$-quantile-based framework for decoding, constructing, splitting, and assessing trajectories from raw AIS records to improve transparency in AIS data mining. Results indicate the proposed filtering algorithm robustly extracts clean, long, and uninterrupted trajectories for further processing.

| **[Simultaneous Trajectory Optimization and Contact Selection for Contact-rich Manipulation with High-Fidelity Geometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16976v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contact-implicit trajectory optimization (CITO) is an effective method to plan complex trajectories for various contact-rich systems including manipulation and locomotion. CITO formulates a mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC) that enforces that contact forces must be zero when points are not in contact. However, MPCC solve times increase steeply with the number of allowable points of contact, which limits CITO's applicability to problems in which only a few, simple geometries are allowed to make contact. This paper introduces simultaneous trajectory optimization and contact selection (STOCS), as an extension of CITO that overcomes this limitation. The innovation of STOCS is to identify salient contact points and times inside the iterative trajectory optimization process. This effectively reduces the number of variables and constraints in each MPCC invocation. The STOCS framework, instantiated with key contact identification subroutines, renders the optimization of manipulation trajectories computationally tractable even for high-fidelity geometries consisting of tens of thousands of vertices.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2306.06465</p></details> |
| **[Synthetic Trajectory Generation Through Convolutional Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16938v1)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Location trajectories provide valuable insights for applications from urban planning to pandemic control. However, mobility data can also reveal sensitive information about individuals, such as political opinions, religious beliefs, or sexual orientations. Existing privacy-preserving approaches for publishing this data face a significant utility-privacy trade-off. Releasing synthetic trajectory data generated through deep learning offers a promising solution. Due to the trajectories' sequential nature, most existing models are based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, research in generative adversarial networks (GANs) largely employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image generation. This discrepancy raises the question of whether advances in computer vision can be applied to trajectory generation. In this work, we introduce a Reversible Trajectory-to-CNN Transformation (RTCT) that adapts trajectories into a format suitable for CNN-based models. We integrated this transformation with the well-known DCGAN in a proof-of-concept (PoC) and evaluated its performance against an RNN-based trajectory GAN using four metrics across two datasets. The PoC was superior in capturing spatial distributions compared to the RNN model but had difficulty replicating sequential and temporal properties. Although the PoC's utility is not sufficient for practical applications, the results demonstrate the transformation's potential to facilitate the use of CNNs for trajectory generation, opening up avenues for future research. To support continued research, all source code has been made available under an open-source license.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Privacy, Security & Trust (PST 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Guaranteed Trajectory Tracking under Learned Dynamics with Contraction Metrics and Disturbance Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08222v5)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an approach to trajectory-centric learning control based on contraction metrics and disturbance estimation for nonlinear systems subject to matched uncertainties. The approach uses deep neural networks to learn uncertain dynamics while still providing guarantees of transient tracking performance throughout the learning phase. Within the proposed approach, a disturbance estimation law is adopted to estimate the pointwise value of the uncertainty, with pre-computable estimation error bounds (EEBs). The learned dynamics, the estimated disturbances, and the EEBs are then incorporated in a robust Riemann energy condition to compute the control law that guarantees exponential convergence of actual trajectories to desired ones throughout the learning phase, even when the learned model is poor. On the other hand, with improved accuracy, the learned model can help improve the robustness of the tracking controller, e.g., against input delays, and can be incorporated to plan better trajectories with improved performance, e.g., lower energy consumption and shorter travel time.The proposed framework is validated on a planar quadrotor example.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

Multimodal trajectory prediction enhances decision-making by considering multiple possible future trajectories based on diverse sources of environmental data. In this approach, we leverage ResNet-50 to extract image features from high-definition map data and use IMU sensor data to calculate speed, acceleration, and yaw rate. A temporal probabilistic network is employed to compute potential trajectories, selecting the most accurate and highly probable trajectory paths. This method integrates HD map data to improve the robustness and reliability of trajectory predictions for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |
| **[PateGail: A Privacy-Preserving Mobility Trajectory Generator with Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16729v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating human mobility trajectories is of great importance to solve the lack of large-scale trajectory data in numerous applications, which is caused by privacy concerns. However, existing mobility trajectory generation methods still require real-world human trajectories centrally collected as the training data, where there exists an inescapable risk of privacy leakage. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we propose PateGail, a privacy-preserving imitation learning model to generate mobility trajectories, which utilizes the powerful generative adversary imitation learning model to simulate the decision-making process of humans. Further, in order to protect user privacy, we train this model collectively based on decentralized mobility data stored in user devices, where personal discriminators are trained locally to distinguish and reward the real and generated human trajectories. In the training process, only the generated trajectories and their rewards obtained based on personal discriminators are shared between the server and devices, whose privacy is further preserved by our proposed perturbation mechanisms with theoretical proof to satisfy differential privacy. Further, to better model the human decision-making process, we propose a novel aggregation mechanism of the rewards obtained from personal discriminators. We theoretically prove that under the reward obtained based on the aggregation mechanism, our proposed model maximizes the lower bound of the discounted total rewards of users. Extensive experiments show that the trajectories generated by our model are able to resemble real-world trajectories in terms of five key statistical metrics, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms by over 48.03%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the synthetic trajectories are able to efficiently support practical applications, including mobility prediction and location recommendation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Stein Variational Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12110v3)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Constrained Stein Variational Trajectory Optimization (CSVTO), an algorithm for performing trajectory optimization with constraints on a set of trajectories in parallel. We frame constrained trajectory optimization as a novel form of constrained functional minimization over trajectory distributions, which avoids treating the constraints as a penalty in the objective and allows us to generate diverse sets of constraint-satisfying trajectories. Our method uses Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) to find a set of particles that approximates a distribution over low-cost trajectories while obeying constraints. CSVTO is applicable to problems with differentiable equality and inequality constraints and includes a novel particle re-sampling step to escape local minima. By explicitly generating diverse sets of trajectories, CSVTO is better able to avoid poor local minima and is more robust to initialization. We demonstrate that CSVTO outperforms baselines in challenging highly-constrained tasks, such as a 7DoF wrench manipulation task, where CSVTO outperforms all baselines both in success and constraint satisfaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Biological knowledge suggests that it may be best to describe complex diseases at the level of underlying pathways, which may interact with one another. We propose a Bayesian approach that allows for characterising such correlation among different pathways through Dependent Gaussian Processes (DGP) and mapping the observed high-dimensional gene expression trajectories into unobserved low-dimensional pathway expression trajectories via Bayesian Sparse Factor Analysis. Our proposal is the first attempt to relax the classical assumption of independent factors for longitudinal data and has demonstrated a superior performance in recovering the shape of pathway expression trajectories, revealing the relationships between genes and pathways, and predicting gene expressions (closer point estimates and narrower predictive intervals), as demonstrated through simulations and real data analysis. To fit the model, we propose a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM) scheme that can be implemented conveniently by combining a standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler and an R package GPFDA (Konzen and others, 2021), which returns the maximum likelihood estimates of DGP hyperparameters. The modular structure of MCEM makes it generalizable to other complex models involving the DGP model component. Our R package DGP4LCF that implements the proposed approach is available on CRAN.</p></details> |  |

However, configuring the skills' parameters for a specific task remains a manual and time-consuming endeavor. Existing approaches for learning or optimizing these parameters often require numerous real-world executions or do not work in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose MuTT, a novel encoder-decoder transformer architecture designed to predict environment-aware executions of robot skills by integrating vision, trajectory, and robot skill parameters. Notably, we pioneer the fusion of vision and trajectory, introducing a novel trajectory projection. Furthermore, we illustrate MuTT's efficacy as a predictor when combined with a model-based robot skill optimizer. This approach facilitates the optimization of robot skill parameters for the current environment, without the need for real-world executions during optimization. Designed for compatibility with any representation of robot skills, MuTT demonstrates its versatility across three comprehensive experiments, showcasing superior performance across two different skill representations.</p></details> |  |

To study this, structured clinical variables from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) data have traditionally been employed by many researchers. Presently, Natural Language Processing models have received great attention in clinical research which expanded the possibilities of using clinical narratives. In this paper, we propose a systematic methodology for developing sepsis prognostic pathways derived from clinical notes, focusing on diverse patient subgroups identified by exploring comorbidities associated with sepsis and generating explanations of these subgroups using SHAP. The extracted prognostic pathways of these subgroups provide valuable insights into the dynamic trajectories of sepsis severity over time. Visualizing these pathways sheds light on the likelihood and direction of disease progression across various contexts and reveals patterns and pivotal factors or biomarkers influencing the transition between sepsis stages, whether toward deterioration or improvement.

Some leading methods in this domain prioritize long-range matching, involving the unrolling of training trajectories with a fixed number of steps (NS) on the synthetic dataset to align with various expert training trajectories. However, traditional long-range matching methods possess an overfitting-like problem, the fixed step size NS forces synthetic dataset to distortedly conform seen expert training trajectories, resulting in a loss of generality-especially to those from unencountered architecture. We refer to this as the Accumulated Mismatching Problem (AMP), and propose a new approach, Automatic Training Trajectories (ATT), which dynamically and adaptively adjusts trajectory length NS to address the AMP. Our method outperforms existing methods particularly in tests involving cross-architectures. Moreover, owing to its adaptive nature, it exhibits enhanced stability in the face of parameter variations.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is accepted at ECCV 2024</p></details> |

This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the most prevalent distance-based vessel trajectory clustering methods, which encompass two main steps: trajectory similarity measurement and clustering. Initially, we conducted a thorough literature review using relevant keywords to gather and summarize pertinent research papers and datasets. Then, this paper discussed the principal methods of data pre-processing that prepare data for further analysis. The survey progresses to detail the leading algorithms for measuring vessel trajectory similarity and the main clustering techniques used in the field today. Furthermore, the various applications of trajectory clustering within the maritime context are explored. Finally, the paper evaluates the effectiveness of different algorithm combinations and pre-processing methods through experimental analysis, focusing on their impact on the performance of distance-based trajectory clustering algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of various trajectory clustering algorithms and notably highlight the significant improvements that trajectory compression techniques contribute to the efficiency and accuracy of trajectory clustering.

| **[Risk-Aware Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Under Safety-Critical Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13480v1)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is significant for intelligent vehicles to achieve high-level autonomous driving, and a lot of relevant research achievements have been made recently. Despite the rapid development, most existing studies solely focused on normal safe scenarios while largely neglecting safety-critical scenarios, particularly those involving imminent collisions. This oversight may result in autonomous vehicles lacking the essential predictive ability in such situations, posing a significant threat to safety. To tackle these, this paper proposes a risk-aware trajectory prediction framework tailored to safety-critical scenarios. Leveraging distinctive hazardous features, we develop three core risk-aware components. First, we introduce a risk-incorporated scene encoder, which augments conventional encoders with quantitative risk information to achieve risk-aware encoding of hazardous scene contexts. Next, we incorporate endpoint-risk-combined intention queries as prediction priors in the decoder to ensure that the predicted multimodal trajectories cover both various spatial intentions and risk levels. Lastly, an auxiliary risk prediction task is implemented for the ultimate risk-aware prediction. Furthermore, to support model training and performance evaluation, we introduce a safety-critical trajectory prediction dataset and tailored evaluation metrics. We conduct comprehensive evaluations and compare our model with several SOTA models. Results demonstrate the superior performance of our model, with a significant improvement in most metrics. This prediction advancement enables autonomous vehicles to execute correct collision avoidance maneuvers under safety-critical scenarios, eventually enhancing road traffic safety.</p></details> |  |

However, the development and ranking of state-of-the-art (SotA) models are driven by their In-Distribution (ID) performance on individual competition datasets. We present an OoD testing protocol that homogenizes datasets and prediction tasks across two large-scale motion datasets. We introduce a novel prediction algorithm based on polynomial representations for agent trajectory and road geometry on both the input and output sides of the model. With a much smaller model size, training effort, and inference time, we reach near SotA performance for ID testing and significantly improve robustness in OoD testing. Within our OoD testing protocol, we further study two augmentation strategies of SotA models and their effects on model generalization. Highlighting the contrast between ID and OoD performance, we suggest adding OoD testing to the evaluation criteria of trajectory prediction models.</p></details> |  |

It's a way of generating a smooth and feasible path for the robot to follow over time. The process primarily takes several factors to generate the path, such as velocity, acceleration and jerk. The process deals with how the robot can follow a desired motion path in a suitable environment. This trajectory planning is extensively used in Automobile Industrial Robot, Manipulators, and Mobile Robots. Trajectory planning is a fundamental component of motion control systems. To perform tasks like pick and place operations, assembly, welding, painting, path following, and obstacle avoidance.

Both algorithms are inspired by a novel theoretical paradigm known as probabilistic optimal control, that reformulates optimal control as an equivalent probabilistic inference problem. This perspective allows to address the problem using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. We show that the application of this algorithm results in a fixed point iteration of probabilistic policies that converge to the deterministic optimal policy. Two strategies for policy evaluation are discussed, using state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods resulting into two distinct algorithms. The algorithms are structurally closest related to the differential dynamic programming algorithm and related methods that use sigma-point methods to avoid direct gradient evaluations. The main advantage of our work is an improved balance between exploration and exploitation over the iterations, leading to improved numerical stability and accelerated convergence. These properties are demonstrated on different nonlinear systems.</p></details> |  |

Notably, friction is not solely dependent on road surface conditions, but also varies significantly depending on the tire temperature. However, tire parameters such as the friction coefficient have been conventionally treated as constant values in automated vehicle motion planning. This paper develops a simple thermodynamic model that captures tire friction temperature variation. To verify the model, it is implemented into trajectory planning for automated drifting - a challenging application that requires leveraging an unstable, drifting equilibrium at the friction limits. The proposed method which captures the hidden tire dynamics provides a dynamically feasible trajectory, leading to more precise tracking during experiments with an LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator) controller.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript was accepted from IEEE Intelligent Vehicle Symposium (IV 2024) and will be published late August</p></details> |

Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have been developed to provably ensure system safety through forward invariance. However, they often unnecessarily sacrifice performance for safety since they are purely reactive. Receding horizon control (RHC), on the other hand, consider planned trajectories to account for the future evolution of a system. This work provides a new perspective on safety-critical control by introducing Forward Invariance in Trajectory Spaces (FITS). We lift the problem of safe RHC into the trajectory space and describe the evolution of planned trajectories as a controlled dynamical system. Safety constraints defined over states can be converted into sets in the trajectory space which we render forward invariant via a CBF framework. We derive an efficient quadratic program (QP) to synthesize trajectories that provably satisfy safety constraints. Our experiments support that FITS improves the adherence to safety specifications without sacrificing performance over alternative CBF and NMPC methods.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

It is common to map trajectories to vectors, called embeddings, before subsequent analyses. Thus, the qualities of embeddings are very important. Methods for pre-training embeddings, which leverage unlabeled trajectories for training universal embeddings, have shown promising applicability across different tasks, thus attracting considerable interest. However, research progress on this topic faces two key challenges: a lack of a comprehensive overview of existing methods, resulting in several related methods not being well-recognized, and the absence of a unified pipeline, complicating the development new methods and the analysis of methods. To overcome these obstacles and advance the field of pre-training of trajectory embeddings, we present UniTE, a survey and a unified pipeline for this domain. In doing so, we present a comprehensive list of existing methods for pre-training trajectory embeddings, which includes methods that either explicitly or implicitly employ pre-training techniques. Further, we present a unified and modular pipeline with publicly available underlying code, simplifying the process of constructing and evaluating methods for pre-training trajectory embeddings. Additionally, we contribute a selection of experimental results using the proposed pipeline on real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

Established trajectory prediction methods primarily use agent tracks generated by a detection and tracking system and HD map as inputs. In this work, we propose a novel method that also incorporates visual input from surround-view cameras, allowing the model to utilize visual cues such as human gazes and gestures, road conditions, vehicle turn signals, etc, which are typically hidden from the model in prior methods. Furthermore, we use textual descriptions generated by a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and refined by a Large Language Model (LLM) as supervision during training to guide the model on what to learn from the input data. Despite using these extra inputs, our method achieves a latency of 53 ms, making it feasible for real-time processing, which is significantly faster than that of previous single-agent prediction methods with similar performance. Our experiments show that both the visual inputs and the textual descriptions contribute to improvements in trajectory prediction performance, and our qualitative analysis highlights how the model is able to exploit these additional inputs. Lastly, in this work we create and release the nuScenes-Text dataset, which augments the established nuScenes dataset with rich textual annotations for every scene, demonstrating the positive impact of utilizing VLM on trajectory prediction.

| **[Multi-Agent Probabilistic Ensembles with Trajectory Sampling for Connected Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13910v3)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have attracted significant attention in recent years and Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable performance in improving the autonomy of vehicles. In that regard, the widely adopted Model-Free RL (MFRL) promises to solve decision-making tasks in connected AVs (CAVs), contingent on the readiness of a significant amount of data samples for training. Nevertheless, it might be infeasible in practice and possibly lead to learning instability. In contrast, Model-Based RL (MBRL) manifests itself in sample-efficient learning, but the asymptotic performance of MBRL might lag behind the state-of-the-art MFRL algorithms. Furthermore, most studies for CAVs are limited to the decision-making of a single AV only, thus underscoring the performance due to the absence of communications. In this study, we try to address the decision-making problem of multiple CAVs with limited communications and propose a decentralized Multi-Agent Probabilistic Ensembles with Trajectory Sampling algorithm MA-PETS. In particular, in order to better capture the uncertainty of the unknown environment, MA-PETS leverages Probabilistic Ensemble (PE) neural networks to learn from communicated samples among neighboring CAVs. Afterwards, MA-PETS capably develops Trajectory Sampling (TS)-based model-predictive control for decision-making. On this basis, we derive the multi-agent group regret bound affected by the number of agents within the communication range and mathematically validate that incorporating effective information exchange among agents into the multi-agent learning scheme contributes to reducing the group regret bound in the worst case. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the superiority of MA-PETS in terms of the sample efficiency comparable to MFBL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory and Power Optimization for Multi-UAV Enabled Emergency Wireless Communications Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11896v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has attracted much attention due to its flexible deployment and controllable mobility. As the general communication network cannot meet the emergency requirements, in this paper we study the multi-UAV enabled wireless emergency communication system. Our goal is to maximize the capacity with jointly optimizing trajectory and allocating power. To tackle this non-convex optimization problem, we first decompose it into two sub-problems to optimize the trajectory and power allocation, respectively. Then, we propose the successive convex approximation technique and the block coordinate update algorithm to solve the two subproblems. The approximate optimal solution can be obtained after continuous iterations. Simulation results show that the capacity can be greatly increased using our proposed joint trajectory optimization and power allocation.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Progressive Pretext Task Learning for Human Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11588v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trajectory prediction is a practical task of predicting the future positions of pedestrians on the road, which typically covers all temporal ranges from short-term to long-term within a trajectory. However, existing works attempt to address the entire trajectory prediction with a singular, uniform training paradigm, neglecting the distinction between short-term and long-term dynamics in human trajectories. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel Progressive Pretext Task learning (PPT) framework, which progressively enhances the model's capacity of capturing short-term dynamics and long-term dependencies for the final entire trajectory prediction. Specifically, we elaborately design three stages of training tasks in the PPT framework. In the first stage, the model learns to comprehend the short-term dynamics through a stepwise next-position prediction task. In the second stage, the model is further enhanced to understand long-term dependencies through a destination prediction task. In the final stage, the model aims to address the entire future trajectory task by taking full advantage of the knowledge from previous stages. To alleviate the knowledge forgetting, we further apply a cross-task knowledge distillation. Additionally, we design a Transformer-based trajectory predictor, which is able to achieve highly efficient two-step reasoning by integrating a destination-driven prediction strategy and a group of learnable prompt embeddings. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks have demonstrated that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.

By leveraging natural language processing techniques, this study introduces the Scientific Concept Navigator (SciConNav), an embedding-based navigation model to infer the "knowledge pathway" from the research trajectories of millions of scholars. We validate that the learned representations effectively delineate disciplinary boundaries and capture the intricate relationships between diverse concepts. The utility of the inferred navigation space is showcased through multiple applications. Firstly, we demonstrated the multi-step analogy inferences within the knowledge space and the interconnectivity between concepts in different disciplines. Secondly, we formulated the attribute dimensions of knowledge across domains, observing the distributional shifts in the arrangement of 19 disciplines along these conceptual dimensions, including "Theoretical" to "Applied", and "Chemical" to "Biomedical', highlighting the evolution of functional attributes within knowledge domains. Lastly, by analyzing the high-dimensional knowledge network structure, we found that knowledge connects with shorter global pathways, and interdisciplinary knowledge plays a critical role in the accessibility of the global knowledge network. Our framework offers a novel approach to mining knowledge inheritance pathways in extensive scientific literature, which is of great significance for understanding scientific progression patterns, tailoring scientific learning trajectories, and accelerating scientific progress.</p></details> | <details><summary>21pag...</summary><p>21pages, 13 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Recent methods predict sub-goals on constructed topology map at each step to enable long-term action planning. However, they suffer from high computational cost when attempting to support such high-level predictions with GCN-like models. In this work, we propose an alternative method that facilitates navigation planning by considering the alignment between instructions and directed fidelity trajectories, which refers to a path from the initial node to the candidate locations on a directed graph without detours. This planning strategy leads to an efficient model while achieving strong performance. Specifically, we introduce a directed graph to illustrate the explored area of the environment, emphasizing directionality. Then, we firstly define the trajectory representation as a sequence of directed edge features, which are extracted from the panorama based on the corresponding orientation. Ultimately, we assess and compare the alignment between instruction and different trajectories during navigation to determine the next navigation target. Our method outperforms previous SOTA method BEVBert on RxR dataset and is comparable on R2R dataset while largely reducing the computational cost.

We aim to learn temporal latent representations of the underlying generative process that explain the observed patient disease trajectories in an interpretable and comprehensive way. To enhance the interpretability of these latent temporal processes, we develop a semi-supervised approach for disentangling the latent space using established medical knowledge. By combining the generative approach with medical definitions of different characteristics of SSc, we facilitate the discovery of new aspects of the disease. We show that the learned temporal latent processes can be utilized for further data analysis and clinical hypothesis testing, including finding similar patients and clustering SSc patient trajectories into novel sub-types. Moreover, our method enables personalized online monitoring and prediction of multivariate time series with uncertainty quantification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Machine Learning for Healthcare 2024. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2311.08149</p></details> |

The system uses readily accessible information from customer smartphones and retail apps, including motion data, store maps, and purchase records. This eliminates the need for additional hardware installations/maintenance and ensures customers full data control. Specifically, RetailOpt first uses inertial navigation to recover relative trajectories from smartphone motion data. The store map and purchase records are cross-referenced to identify a list of visited shelves, providing anchors to localize the relative trajectories in a store through continuous and discrete optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in five diverse environments. The system, if successful, would produce accurate customer movement data, essential for a broad range of retail applications including customer behavior analysis and in-store navigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Tracking for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in 3D Spaces under Motion Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10837v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article presents a three-dimensional nonlinear trajectory tracking control strategy for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the presence of spatial constraints. As opposed to many existing control strategies, which do not consider spatial constraints, the proposed strategy considers spatial constraints on each degree of freedom movement of the UAV. Such consideration makes the design appealing for many practical applications, such as pipeline inspection, boundary tracking, etc. The proposed design accounts for the limited information about the inertia matrix, thereby affirming its inherent robustness against unmodeled dynamics and other imperfections. We rigorously show that the UAV will converge to its desired path by maintaining bounded position, orientation, and linear and angular speeds. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy through various numerical simulations.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by the pivotal role trajectory length plays in the training process, we introduce Ada-NAV, a novel adaptive trajectory length scheme designed to enhance the training sample efficiency of RL algorithms in robotic navigation tasks. Unlike traditional approaches that treat trajectory length as a fixed hyperparameter, we propose to dynamically adjust it based on the entropy of the underlying navigation policy. Interestingly, Ada-NAV can be applied to both existing on-policy and off-policy RL methods, which we demonstrate by empirically validating its efficacy on three popular RL methods: REINFORCE, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). We demonstrate through simulated and real-world robotic experiments that Ada-NAV outperforms conventional methods that employ constant or randomly sampled trajectory lengths. Specifically, for a fixed sample budget, Ada-NAV achieves an 18\% increase in navigation success rate, a 20-38\% reduction in navigation path length, and a 9.32\% decrease in elevation costs. Furthermore, we showcase the versatility of Ada-NAV by integrating it with the Clearpath Husky robot, illustrating its applicability in complex outdoor environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Strengthening attacks and uncovering vulnerabilities, especially common issues in VLP models (e.g., high transferable AEs), can advance reliable and practical VLP models. A recent work (i.e., Set-level guidance attack) indicates that augmenting image-text pairs to increase AE diversity along the optimization path enhances the transferability of adversarial examples significantly. However, this approach predominantly emphasizes diversity around the online adversarial examples (i.e., AEs in the optimization period), leading to the risk of overfitting the victim model and affecting the transferability. In this study, we posit that the diversity of adversarial examples towards the clean input and online AEs are both pivotal for enhancing transferability across VLP models. Consequently, we propose using diversification along the intersection region of adversarial trajectory to expand the diversity of AEs. To fully leverage the interaction between modalities, we introduce text-guided adversarial example selection during optimization. Furthermore, to further mitigate the potential overfitting, we direct the adversarial text deviating from the last intersection region along the optimization path, rather than adversarial images as in existing methods. Extensive experiments affirm the effectiveness of our method in improving transferability across various VLP models and downstream vision-and-language tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV2...</summary><p>ECCV2024.

This work introduces a novel approach that combines RL with trajectory optimization to manage this trade-off effectively. Our approach embeds safety constraints within the action space of a modified Markov Decision Process (MDP). The RL agent produces a sequence of actions that are transformed into safe trajectories by a trajectory optimizer, thereby effectively ensuring safety and increasing training stability. This novel approach excels in its performance on challenging Safety Gym tasks, achieving significantly higher rewards and near-zero safety violations during inference. The method's real-world applicability is demonstrated through a safe and effective deployment in a real robot task of box-pushing around obstacles.</p></details> |  |

However, generating factually consistent responses in knowledge-intensive scenarios remains a challenge due to issues such as hallucination, difficulty in acquiring long-tailed knowledge, and limited memory expansion. This paper introduces SMART, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages external knowledge to enhance the interpretability and factual consistency of LLM-generated responses. SMART comprises four specialized agents, each performing a specific sub-trajectory action to navigate complex knowledge-intensive tasks. We propose a multi-agent co-training paradigm, Long- and Short-Trajectory Learning, which ensures synergistic collaboration among agents while maintaining fine-grained execution by each agent. Extensive experiments on 5 tasks demonstrate SMART's superior performance compared to previous widely adopted methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating 6-D Trajectories for Omnidirectional Multirotor Aerial Vehicles in Cluttered Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10392v2)** | 2024-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As fully-actuated systems, omnidirectional multirotor aerial vehicles (OMAVs) have more flexible maneuverability and advantages in aggressive flight in cluttered environments than traditional underactuated MAVs. %Due to the high dimensionality of configuration space, making the designed trajectory generation algorithm efficient is challenging. This paper aims to achieve safe flight of OMAVs in cluttered environments. Considering existing static obstacles, an efficient optimization-based framework is proposed to generate 6-D $SE(3)$ trajectories for OMAVs. Given the kinodynamic constraints and the 3D collision-free region represented by a series of intersecting convex polyhedra, the proposed method finally generates a safe and dynamically feasible 6-D trajectory. First, we parameterize the vehicle's attitude into a free 3D vector using stereographic projection to eliminate the constraints inherent in the $SO(3)$ manifold, while the complete $SE(3)$ trajectory is represented as a 6-D polynomial in time without inherent constraints. The vehicle's shape is modeled as a cuboid attached to the body frame to achieve whole-body collision evaluation. Then, we formulate the origin trajectory generation problem as a constrained optimization problem. The original constrained problem is finally transformed into an unconstrained one that can be solved efficiently. To verify the proposed framework's performance, simulations and real-world experiments based on a tilt-rotor hexarotor aerial vehicle are carried out.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

Existing physics-informed neural networks often emphasize short-term physics constraints, leaving the proper preservation of long-term conservation less explored. We introduce Neural Characteristic Trajectory Fields, a novel representation utilizing Eulerian neural fields to implicitly model Lagrangian fluid trajectories. This topology-free, auto-differentiable representation facilitates efficient flow map calculations between arbitrary frames as well as efficient velocity extraction via auto-differentiation. Consequently, it enables end-to-end supervision covering long-term conservation and short-term physics priors. Building on the representation, we propose physics-informed trajectory learning and integration into NeRF-based scene reconstruction. We enable advanced obstacle handling through self-supervised scene decomposition and seamless integrated boundary constraints.

| **[Towards Personalised Patient Risk Prediction Using Temporal Hospital Data Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09373v1)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantifying a patient's health status provides clinicians with insight into patient risk, and the ability to better triage and manage resources. Early Warning Scores (EWS) are widely deployed to measure overall health status, and risk of adverse outcomes, in hospital patients. However, current EWS are limited both by their lack of personalisation and use of static observations. We propose a pipeline that groups intensive care unit patients by the trajectories of observations data throughout their stay as a basis for the development of personalised risk predictions. Feature importance is considered to provide model explainability. Using the MIMIC-IV dataset, six clusters were identified, capturing differences in disease codes, observations, lengths of admissions and outcomes. Applying the pipeline to data from just the first four hours of each ICU stay assigns the majority of patients to the same cluster as when the entire stay duration is considered. In-hospital mortality prediction models trained on individual clusters had higher F1 score performance in five of the six clusters when compared against the unclustered patient cohort. The pipeline could form the basis of a clinical decision support tool, working to improve the clinical characterisation of risk groups and the early detection of patient deterioration.</p></details> |  |

Location-Based Services (LBS) capitalize on this trajectory data to offer users personalized services tailored to their location information. However, this trajectory data contains sensitive information about users' movement patterns and habits, necessitating confidentiality and protection from unknown collectors. To address this challenge, privacy-preserving methods like K-anonymity and Differential Privacy have been proposed to safeguard private information in the dataset. Despite their effectiveness, these methods can impact the original features by introducing perturbations or generating unrealistic trajectory data, leading to suboptimal performance in downstream tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Federated Variational AutoEncoder (FedVAE) approach, which effectively generates a new trajectory dataset while preserving the confidentiality of private information and retaining the structure of the original features. In addition, FedVAE leverages Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) to maintain the original feature space and generate new trajectory data, and incorporates Federated Learning (FL) during the training stage, ensuring that users' data remains locally stored to protect their personal information. The results demonstrate its superior performance compared to other existing methods, affirming FedVAE as a promising solution for enhancing data privacy and utility in location-based applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>2023 ...</summary><p>2023 IEEE 98th Vehicular Technology Conference</p></details> |

However, the high cost of collecting demonstration data is a significant bottleneck. Videos, as a rich data source, contain knowledge of behaviors, physics, and semantics, but extracting control-specific information from them is challenging due to the lack of action labels. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, Any-point Trajectory Modeling (ATM), that utilizes video demonstrations by pre-training a trajectory model to predict future trajectories of arbitrary points within a video frame. Once trained, these trajectories provide detailed control guidance, enabling the learning of robust visuomotor policies with minimal action-labeled data. Across over 130 language-conditioned tasks we evaluated in both simulation and the real world, ATM outperforms strong video pre-training baselines by 80% on average. Furthermore, we show effective transfer learning of manipulation skills from human videos and videos from a different robot morphology.

A novel energy function optimization-based framework is proposed to generate prediction trajectories. Firstly, a new energy function is designed for easier optimization. Secondly, an online optimization pipeline for calculating parameters and agents' velocities is developed. In this pipeline, we first design an efficient group division method based on Frechet distance to classify agents online. Then the strategy on decoupling the optimization of velocities and critical parameters in the energy function is developed, where the the slap swarm algorithm and gradient descent algorithms are integrated to solve the optimization problems more efficiently. Thirdly, we propose a similarity-based resample evaluation algorithm to predict agents' optimal goals, defined as the target-moving headings of agents, which effectively extracts hidden information in observed states and avoids learning agents' destinations via the training dataset in advance. Experiments and comparison studies verify the advantages of the proposed method in terms of prediction accuracy and speed.</p></details> |  |

However, this task is complicated by the inherent high dimensionality, temporal sparsity and sampling irregularity in longitudinal image acquisitions. Existing methods often rely on extracting hand-crafted features and performing time-series analysis in this vector space, leading to a loss of rich spatial information within the images. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ImageFlowNet, a novel framework that learns latent-space flow fields that evolve multiscale representations in joint embedding spaces using neural ODEs and SDEs to model disease progression in the image domain. Notably, ImageFlowNet learns multiscale joint representation spaces by combining cohorts of patients together so that information can be transferred between the patient samples. The dynamics then provide plausible trajectories of progression, with the SDE providing alternative trajectories from the same starting point. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We then demonstrate ImageFlowNet's effectiveness through empirical evaluations on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in retinal geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixed...</summary><p>Fixed some typos.

| **[Adaptive Human Trajectory Prediction via Latent Corridors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06653v2)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trajectory prediction is typically posed as a zero-shot generalization problem: a predictor is learnt on a dataset of human motion in training scenes, and then deployed on unseen test scenes. While this paradigm has yielded tremendous progress, it fundamentally assumes that trends in human behavior within the deployment scene are constant over time. As such, current prediction models are unable to adapt to scene-specific transient human behaviors, such as crowds temporarily gathering to see buskers, pedestrians hurrying through the rain and avoiding puddles, or a protest breaking out. We formalize the problem of scene-specific adaptive trajectory prediction and propose a new adaptation approach inspired by prompt tuning called latent corridors. By augmenting the input of any pre-trained human trajectory predictor with learnable image prompts, the predictor can improve in the deployment scene by inferring trends from extremely small amounts of new data (e.g., 2 humans observed for 30 seconds). With less than 0.1% additional model parameters, we see up to 23.9% ADE improvement in MOTSynth simulated data and 16.4% ADE in MOT and Wildtrack real pedestrian data. Qualitatively, we observe that latent corridors imbue predictors with an awareness of scene geometry and scene-specific human behaviors that non-adaptive predictors struggle to capture.

They can be considered to be simplified traffic flow maps, whereas the computational challenges in aggregating small scale traffic flows prevent the wider dissemination of high resolution flow maps. Vehicle trajectories are a promising data source to solve this challenging problem. The solution begins with the alignment (or map matching) of the trajectories to the road network. However even the state-of-the-art map matching implementations produce sub-optimal results with small misalignments. While these misalignments are negligible for large scale flow aggregation in desire line maps, they pose substantial obstacles for small scale flow aggregation in high resolution maps. To remove these remaining misalignments, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. With each local alignment iteration, the misalignments of the trajectories with each other and with the road network are reduced, and so converge closer to a minimal flow map. By analysing a set of empirical trajectories collected in Hannover, Germany, we confirm that our minimal flow map has high levels of spatial resolution, accuracy and coverage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Path Long-Term Vessel Trajectories Forecasting with Probabilistic Feature Fusion for Problem Shifting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18948v6)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenge of boosting the precision of multi-path long-term vessel trajectory forecasting on engineered sequences of Automatic Identification System (AIS) data using feature fusion for problem shifting. We have developed a deep auto-encoder model and a phased framework approach to predict the next 12 hours of vessel trajectories using 1 to 3 hours of AIS data as input. To this end, we fuse the spatiotemporal features from the AIS messages with probabilistic features engineered from historical AIS data referring to potential routes and destinations. As a result, we reduce the forecasting uncertainty by shifting the problem into a trajectory reconstruction problem. The probabilistic features have an F1-Score of approximately 85% and 75% for the vessel route and destination prediction, respectively. Under such circumstances, we achieved an R2 Score of over 98% with different layer structures and varying feature combinations; the high R2 Score is a natural outcome of the well-defined shipping lanes in the study region. However, our proposal stands out among competing approaches as it demonstrates the capability of complex decision-making during turnings and route selection. Furthermore, we have shown that our model achieves more accurate forecasting with average and median errors of 11km and 6km, respectively, a 25% improvement from the current state-of-the-art approaches. The resulting model from this proposal is deployed as part of a broader Decision Support System to safeguard whales by preventing the risk of vessel-whale collisions under the smartWhales initiative and acting on the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Atlantic Canada.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we present an exploration-based trajectory optimization approach, referred to as ETO. This learning method is designed to enhance the performance of open LLM agents. Contrary to previous studies that exclusively train on successful expert trajectories, our method allows agents to learn from their exploration failures. This leads to improved performance through an iterative optimization framework. During the exploration phase, the agent interacts with the environment while completing given tasks, gathering failure trajectories to create contrastive trajectory pairs. In the subsequent training phase, the agent utilizes these trajectory preference pairs to update its policy using contrastive learning methods like DPO. This iterative cycle of exploration and training fosters continued improvement in the agents. Our experiments on three complex tasks demonstrate that ETO consistently surpasses baseline performance by a large margin.

The modeling of the behavior of the vehicle in these events is crucial to proper planning and controlling; the used model should present accurate and computationally efficient properties to ensure consistency with the dynamics of the vehicle and to be employed in real-time systems. In this article, we propose an LSTM-based hybrid extended bicycle model able to present an accurate description of the state of the vehicle for both normal and aggressive situations. The introduced model is used in a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) plan and control framework for performing trajectories in high-dynamic scenarios. The proposed model and framework prove their ability to plan feasible trajectories ensuring an accurate vehicle behavior even at the limits of handling.</p></details> |  |

For instance, the intricate flying behavior of migratory birds hinges on their analysis of environmental cues such as wind direction and air pressure. However, the diverse and dynamic nature of contextual information renders it an arduous task for AI models to comprehend its impact on trajectories and consequently predict them accurately. To address this issue, we propose a ``manager-worker'' framework to unleash the full potential of contextual information and construct CATP model, an implementation of the framework for Context-Aware Trajectory Prediction. The framework comprises a manager model, several worker models, and a tailored training mechanism inspired by competition symbiosis in nature. Taking CATP as an example, each worker needs to compete against others for training data and develop an advantage in predicting specific moving patterns. The manager learns the workers' performance in different contexts and selects the best one in the given context to predict trajectories, enabling CATP as a whole to operate in a symbiotic manner. We conducted two comparative experiments and an ablation study to quantitatively evaluate the proposed framework and CATP model. The results showed that CATP could outperform SOTA models, and the framework could be generalized to different context-aware tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, if relay technology is utilized unlawfully, it can amplify potential harm. Effectively surveilling illegitimate relay links poses a challenging problem. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can proactively surveil wireless relay systems due to their flexible mobility. This work focuses on maximizing the eavesdropping rate (ER) of UAVs by jointly optimizing the trajectory and jamming power.

Processing ALS data at scale requires efficient point classification methods that perform well over highly diverse territories. To evaluate them, researchers need large annotated Lidar datasets, however, current Lidar benchmark datasets have restricted scope and often cover a single urban area. To bridge this data gap, we present the FRench ALS Clouds from TArgeted Landscapes (FRACTAL) dataset: an ultra-large-scale aerial Lidar dataset made of 100,000 dense point clouds with high-quality labels for 7 semantic classes and spanning 250 km$^2$. FRACTAL is built upon France's nationwide open Lidar data. It achieves spatial and semantic diversity via a sampling scheme that explicitly concentrates rare classes and challenging landscapes from five French regions. It should support the development of 3D deep learning approaches for large-scale land monitoring. We describe the nature of the source data, the sampling workflow, the content of the resulting dataset, and provide an initial evaluation of segmentation performance using a performant 3D neural architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages | 9 figures | 8 tables | Dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/IGNF/FRACTAL | Trained model is available at https://huggingface.co/IGNF/FRACTAL-LidarHD_7cl_randlanet | Deep learning code repository is on Gihtub at https://github.com/IGNF/myria3d | Data engineering code repository is on Github at https://github.com/IGNF/pacasam</p></details> |
| **[Can Reinforcement Learning Unlock the Hidden Dangers in Aligned Large Language Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02651v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language tasks, but their safety and morality remain contentious due to their training on internet text corpora. To address these concerns, alignment techniques have been developed to improve the public usability and safety of LLMs. Yet, the potential for generating harmful content through these models seems to persist. This paper explores the concept of jailbreaking LLMs-reversing their alignment through adversarial triggers. Previous methods, such as soft embedding prompts, manually crafted prompts, and gradient-based automatic prompts, have had limited success on black-box models due to their requirements for model access and for producing a low variety of manually crafted prompts, making them susceptible to being blocked. This paper introduces a novel approach using reinforcement learning to optimize adversarial triggers, requiring only inference API access to the target model and a small surrogate model. Our method, which leverages a BERTScore-based reward function, enhances the transferability and effectiveness of adversarial triggers on new black-box models. We demonstrate that this approach improves the performance of adversarial triggers on a previously untested language model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AI4CYBER - KDD 2024</p></details> |

A promising approach to address these concerns involves training models to automatically generate adversarial prompts for red teaming. However, the evolving subtlety of vulnerabilities in LLMs challenges the effectiveness of current adversarial methods, which struggle to specifically target and explore the weaknesses of these models. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the $\mathbf{S}\text{elf-}\mathbf{E}\text{volving }\mathbf{A}\text{dversarial }\mathbf{S}\text{afety }\mathbf{(SEAS)}$ optimization framework, which enhances security by leveraging data generated by the model itself. SEAS operates through three iterative stages: Initialization, Attack, and Adversarial Optimization, refining both the Red Team and Target models to improve robustness and safety. This framework reduces reliance on manual testing and significantly enhances the security capabilities of LLMs. Our contributions include a novel adversarial framework, a comprehensive safety dataset, and after three iterations, the Target model achieves a security level comparable to GPT-4, while the Red Team model shows a marked increase in attack success rate (ASR) against advanced models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting and Understanding Human Action Decisions: Insights from Large Language Models and Cognitive Instance-Based Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09281v2)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their capabilities across various tasks, from language translation to complex reasoning. Understanding and predicting human behavior and biases are crucial for artificial intelligence (AI) assisted systems to provide useful assistance, yet it remains an open question whether these models can achieve this. This paper addresses this gap by leveraging the reasoning and generative capabilities of the LLMs to predict human behavior in two sequential decision-making tasks. These tasks involve balancing between exploitative and exploratory actions and handling delayed feedback, both essential for simulating real-life decision processes. We compare the performance of LLMs with a cognitive instance-based learning (IBL) model, which imitates human experiential decision-making. Our findings indicate that LLMs excel at rapidly incorporating feedback to enhance prediction accuracy. In contrast, the cognitive IBL model better accounts for human exploratory behaviors and effectively captures loss aversion bias, i.e., the tendency to choose a sub-optimal goal with fewer step-cost penalties rather than exploring to find the optimal choice, even with limited experience. The results highlight the benefits of integrating LLMs with cognitive architectures, suggesting that this synergy could enhance the modeling and understanding of complex human decision-making patterns.</p></details> |  |

However, these models are often trained for specific tasks and rely on task-specific input-output formats, limiting their applicability to a broader range of tasks. This raises a fundamental question: Can we develop a unified approach to represent and handle different multi-modal tasks to maximize the generalizability of MLLMs? In this paper, we propose UnifiedMLLM, a comprehensive model designed to represent various tasks using a unified representation. Our model exhibits strong capabilities in comprehending the implicit intent of user instructions and preforming reasoning. In addition to generating textual responses, our model also outputs task tokens and grounding tokens, serving as indicators of task types and task granularity. These outputs are subsequently routed through the task router and directed to specific expert models for task completion. To train our model, we construct a task-specific dataset and an 100k multi-task dataset encompassing complex scenarios. Employing a three-stage training strategy, we equip our model with robust reasoning and task processing capabilities while preserving its generalization capacity and knowledge reservoir. Extensive experiments showcase the impressive performance of our unified representation approach across various tasks, surpassing existing methodologies. Furthermore, our approach exhibits exceptional scalability and generality. Our code, model, and dataset will be available at \url{https://github.com/lzw-lzw/UnifiedMLLM}.</p></details> |  |

In fact, the values of the hyperparameters directly impact the trajectory taken by the optimization process, and their choice requires extensive reasoning by human operators. Although a variety of self-adaptive Evolutionary Algorithms have been proposed in the literature, no definitive solution has been found. In this work, we perform a preliminary investigation to automate the reasoning process that leads to the choice of hyperparameter values. We employ two open-source Large Language Models (LLMs), namely Llama2-70b and Mixtral, to analyze the optimization logs online and provide novel real-time hyperparameter recommendations. We study our approach in the context of step-size adaptation for (1+1)-ES. The results suggest that LLMs can be an effective method for optimizing hyperparameters in Evolution Strategies, encouraging further research in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the GECCO'24 Companion: Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference Companion</p></details> |

A Study on the Impact of Format Restrictions on Performance of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02442v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structured generation, the process of producing content in standardized formats like JSON and XML, is widely utilized in real-world applications to extract key output information from large language models (LLMs). This study investigates whether such constraints on generation space impact LLMs' abilities, including reasoning and domain knowledge comprehension. Specifically, we evaluate LLMs' performance when restricted to adhere to structured formats versus generating free-form responses across various common tasks. Surprisingly, we observe a significant decline in LLMs' reasoning abilities under format restrictions. Furthermore, we find that stricter format constraints generally lead to greater performance degradation in reasoning tasks.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Revolutionizing Urban Safety Perception Assessments: Integrating Multimodal Large Language Models with Street View Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19719v2)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Measuring urban safety perception is an important and complex task that traditionally relies heavily on human resources. This process often involves extensive field surveys, manual data collection, and subjective assessments, which can be time-consuming, costly, and sometimes inconsistent. Street View Images (SVIs), along with deep learning methods, provide a way to realize large-scale urban safety detection. However, achieving this goal often requires extensive human annotation to train safety ranking models, and the architectural differences between cities hinder the transferability of these models. Thus, a fully automated method for conducting safety evaluations is essential. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated powerful reasoning and analytical capabilities. Cutting-edge models, e.g., GPT-4 have shown surprising performance in many tasks. We employed these models for urban safety ranking on a human-annotated anchor set and validated that the results from MLLMs align closely with human perceptions. Additionally, we proposed a method based on the pre-trained Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) feature and K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) retrieval to quickly assess the safety index of the entire city. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing training needed deep learning approaches, achieving efficient and accurate urban safety evaluations. The proposed automation for urban safety perception assessment is a valuable tool for city planners, policymakers, and researchers aiming to improve urban environments.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Unraveling Prompt Extraction Threats in Customized Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02416v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The drastic increase of large language models' (LLMs) parameters has led to a new research direction of fine-tuning-free downstream customization by prompts, i.e., task descriptions. While these prompt-based services (e.g. OpenAI's GPTs) play an important role in many businesses, there has emerged growing concerns about the prompt leakage, which undermines the intellectual properties of these services and causes downstream attacks. In this paper, we analyze the underlying mechanism of prompt leakage, which we refer to as prompt memorization, and develop corresponding defending strategies. By exploring the scaling laws in prompt extraction, we analyze key attributes that influence prompt extraction, including model sizes, prompt lengths, as well as the types of prompts. Then we propose two hypotheses that explain how LLMs expose their prompts. The first is attributed to the perplexity, i.e. the familiarity of LLMs to texts, whereas the second is based on the straightforward token translation path in attention matrices. To defend against such threats, we investigate whether alignments can undermine the extraction of prompts. We find that current LLMs, even those with safety alignments like GPT-4, are highly vulnerable to prompt extraction attacks, even under the most straightforward user attacks. Therefore, we put forward several defense strategies with the inspiration of our findings, which achieve 83.8\% and 71.0\% drop in the prompt extraction rate for Llama2-7B and GPT-3.5, respectively.

In the realm of conversational artificial intelligence, the ability to discern and respond to human affective cues is a critical factor for creating engaging and empathetic interactions. This study investigates the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to recognise human affect in conversations, with a focus on both open-domain chit-chat dialogues and task-oriented dialogues. Leveraging three diverse datasets, namely IEMOCAP (Busso et al., 2008), EmoWOZ (Feng et al., 2022), and DAIC-WOZ (Gratch et al., 2014), covering a spectrum of dialogues from casual conversations to clinical interviews, we evaluate and compare LLMs' performance in affect recognition. Our investigation explores the zero-shot and few-shot capabilities of LLMs through in-context learning as well as their model capacities through task-specific fine-tuning. Additionally, this study takes into account the potential impact of automatic speech recognition errors on LLM predictions. With this work, we aim to shed light on the extent to which LLMs can replicate human-like affect recognition capabilities in conversations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGDIAL 2024</p></details> |

Recent research has shown that the UAV-to-UAV (U2U) cooperative perception system has great potential to revolutionize the autonomous flight industry. However, the lack of a large-scale dataset is hindering progress in this area. This paper presents U2UData, the first large-scale cooperative perception dataset for swarm UAVs autonomous flight. The dataset was collected by three UAVs flying autonomously in the U2USim, covering a 9 km$^2$ flight area. It comprises 315K LiDAR frames, 945K RGB and depth frames, and 2.41M annotated 3D bounding boxes for 3 classes. It also includes brightness, temperature, humidity, smoke, and airflow values covering all flight routes. U2USim is the first real-world mapping swarm UAVs simulation environment. It takes Yunnan Province as the prototype and includes 4 terrains, 7 weather conditions, and 8 sensor types. U2UData introduces two perception tasks: cooperative 3D object detection and cooperative 3D object tracking. This paper provides comprehensive benchmarks of recent cooperative perception algorithms on these tasks.</p></details> | Accepted by ACM MM24 |

It uses a sparse model to replace the dense model, achieving comparable performance while activating fewer parameters during inference, thus significantly reducing the inference cost. Existing MoE methods in LVLMs encourage different experts to handle different tokens, and they usually employ a router to predict the routing of each token. However, the predictions are based solely on sample features and do not truly reveal the optimization directions of tokens. This may lead to severe optimization interference between different tokens assigned to an expert. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel method based on token-level gradient analysis, i.e., Solving Token Gradient Conflict (STGC). Specifically, we first use token-level gradients to identify conflicting tokens in experts. After that, we add a specialized loss tailored to eliminate conflicts among tokens within each expert. Our method can serve as a plug-in for diverse Large Vision-Language Models, and extensive experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/longrongyang/STGC.</p></details> |  |

Universal Black Box Jailbreaking of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01446v4)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs), designed to provide helpful and safe responses, often rely on alignment techniques to align with user intent and social guidelines. Unfortunately, this alignment can be exploited by malicious actors seeking to manipulate an LLM's outputs for unintended purposes. In this paper we introduce a novel approach that employs a genetic algorithm (GA) to manipulate LLMs when model architecture and parameters are inaccessible. The GA attack works by optimizing a universal adversarial prompt that -- when combined with a user's query -- disrupts the attacked model's alignment, resulting in unintended and potentially harmful outputs. Our novel approach systematically reveals a model's limitations and vulnerabilities by uncovering instances where its responses deviate from expected behavior. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate the efficacy of our technique, thus contributing to the ongoing discussion on responsible AI development by providing a diagnostic tool for evaluating and enhancing alignment of LLMs with human intent. To our knowledge this is the first automated universal black box jailbreak attack.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SeT-LLM @ ICLR 2024</p></details> |

This paper explores fine-tuning LLMs for stock return forecasting with financial newsflow. In quantitative investing, return forecasting is fundamental for subsequent tasks like stock picking, portfolio optimization, etc. We formulate the model to include text representation and forecasting modules. We propose to compare the encoder-only and decoder-only LLMs, considering they generate text representations in distinct ways. The impact of these different representations on forecasting performance remains an open question. Meanwhile, we compare two simple methods of integrating LLMs' token-level representations into the forecasting module. The experiments on real news and investment universes reveal that: (1) aggregated representations from LLMs' token-level embeddings generally produce return predictions that enhance the performance of long-only and long-short portfolios; (2) in the relatively large investment universe, the decoder LLMs-based prediction model leads to stronger portfolios, whereas in the small universes, there are no consistent winners. Among the three LLMs studied (DeBERTa, Mistral, Llama), Mistral performs more robustly across different universes; (3) return predictions derived from LLMs' text representations are a strong signal for portfolio construction, outperforming conventional sentiment scores.</p></details> |  |

While these relations are fully applicable across scientific areas, existing models are trained on few domain-specific datasets such as SciERC and do not perform well on new target domains. In this paper, we experiment with leveraging in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models to perform schema-constrained data annotation, collecting in-domain training instances for a Transformer-based relation extraction model deployed on titles and abstracts of research papers in the Architecture, Construction, Engineering and Operations (AECO) domain. By assessing the performance gain with respect to a baseline Deep Learning architecture trained on off-domain data, we show that by using a few-shot learning strategy with structured prompts and only minimal expert annotation the presented approach can potentially support domain adaptation of a science KG generation model.</p></details> |  |

Based on the powerful LLMs, multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) extend the modality from text to a broader spectrum of domains, attracting widespread attention due to the broader range of application scenarios. As LLMs and MLLMs rely on vast amounts of model parameters and data to achieve emergent capabilities, the importance of data is receiving increasingly widespread attention and recognition. Tracing and analyzing recent data-oriented works for MLLMs, we find that the development of models and data is not two separate paths but rather interconnected. On the one hand, vaster and higher-quality data contribute to better performance of MLLMs; on the other hand, MLLMs can facilitate the development of data. The co-development of multi-modal data and MLLMs requires a clear view of 1) at which development stages of MLLMs specific data-centric approaches can be employed to enhance certain MLLM capabilities, and 2) how MLLMs, utilizing those capabilities, can contribute to multi-modal data in specific roles. To promote the data-model co-development for MLLM community, we systematically review existing works related to MLLMs from the data-model co-development perspective.

The KG-guided navigation fosters deep and long-range associations to uphold logical consistency and optimize the scope of retrieval for precision and interoperability. In conjunction, factual consistency can be better ensured through semantic similarity guided by precise directives. ToG${2.0}$ not only improves the accuracy and reliability of LLMs' responses but also demonstrates the potential of hybrid structured knowledge systems to significantly advance LLM reasoning, aligning it closer to human-like performance. We conducted extensive experiments on four public datasets to demonstrate the advantages of our method compared to the baseline.</p></details> |  |

Here, we introduce a multi-constraint molecular generation large language model, TSMMG, which, akin to a student, incorporates knowledge from various small models and tools, namely, the 'teachers'. To train TSMMG, we construct a large set of text-molecule pairs by extracting molecular knowledge from these 'teachers', enabling it to generate novel molecules that conform to the descriptions through various text prompts. We experimentally show that TSMMG remarkably performs in generating molecules meeting complex, natural language-described property requirements across two-, three-, and four-constraint tasks, with an average molecular validity of over 99% and success ratio of 82.58%, 68.03%, and 67.48%, respectively. The model also exhibits adaptability through zero-shot testing, creating molecules that satisfy combinations of properties that have not been encountered. It can comprehend text inputs with various language styles, extending beyond the confines of outlined prompts, as confirmed through empirical validation. Additionally, the knowledge distillation feature of TSMMG contributes to the continuous enhancement of small models, while the innovative approach to dataset construction effectively addresses the issues of data scarcity and quality, which positions TSMMG as a promising tool in the domains of drug discovery and materials science.</p></details> | 37 pages, 10 figures |

However, existing financial LLMs often face challenges such as hallucinations or superficial parameter training, resulting in suboptimal performance, particularly in financial computing and machine reading comprehension (MRC). To address these issues, we propose a novel large language model specifically designed for the Chinese financial domain, named SNFinLLM. SNFinLLM excels in domain-specific tasks such as answering questions, summarizing financial research reports, analyzing sentiment, and executing financial calculations. We then perform the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance the model's proficiency across various financial domains. Specifically, we gather extensive financial data and create a high-quality instruction dataset composed of news articles, professional papers, and research reports of finance domain. Utilizing both domain-specific and general datasets, we proceed with continuous pre-training on an established open-source base model, resulting in SNFinLLM-base. Following this, we engage in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to bolster the model's capability across multiple financial tasks. Crucially, we employ a straightforward Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) method to better align the model with human preferences. Extensive experiments conducted on finance benchmarks and our evaluation dataset demonstrate that SNFinLLM markedly outperforms other state-of-the-art financial language models.

However, P2P lending faces the challenge of information asymmetry, as lenders often lack sufficient data to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers. This paper proposes a novel approach to address this issue by leveraging the textual descriptions provided by borrowers during the loan application process. Our methodology involves processing these textual descriptions using a Large Language Model (LLM), a powerful tool capable of discerning patterns and semantics within the text. Transfer learning is applied to adapt the LLM to the specific task at hand. Our results derived from the analysis of the Lending Club dataset show that the risk score generated by BERT, a widely used LLM, significantly improves the performance of credit risk classifiers. However, the inherent opacity of LLM-based systems, coupled with uncertainties about potential biases, underscores critical considerations for regulatory frameworks and engenders trust-related concerns among end-users, opening new avenues for future research in the dynamic landscape of P2P lending and artificial intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Faux Polyglot: A Study on Information Disparity in Multilingual Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05502v2)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLMs) are playing a pivotal role in information search and are being adopted globally. Although the multilingual capability of LLMs offers new opportunities to bridge the language barrier, do these capabilities translate into real-life scenarios where linguistic divide and knowledge conflicts between multilingual sources are known occurrences? In this paper, we studied LLM's linguistic preference in a RAG-based information search setting. We found that LLMs displayed systemic bias towards information in the same language as the query language in both information retrieval and answer generation. Furthermore, in scenarios where there is little information in the language of the query, LLMs prefer documents in high-resource languages, reinforcing the dominant views. Such bias exists for both factual and opinion-based queries. Our results highlight the linguistic divide within multilingual LLMs in information search systems. The seemingly beneficial multilingual capability of LLMs may backfire on information parity by reinforcing language-specific information cocoons or filter bubbles further marginalizing low-resource views.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometric Algebra Meets Large Language Models: Instruction-Based Transformations of Separate Meshes in 3D, Interactive and Controllable Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02275v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Conformal Geometric Algebra (CGA) to revolutionize controllable 3D scene editing, particularly for object repositioning tasks, which traditionally requires intricate manual processes and specialized expertise. These conventional methods typically suffer from reliance on large training datasets or lack a formalized language for precise edits. Utilizing CGA as a robust formal language, our system, shenlong, precisely models spatial transformations necessary for accurate object repositioning. Leveraging the zero-shot learning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs, shenlong translates natural language instructions into CGA operations which are then applied to the scene, facilitating exact spatial transformations within 3D scenes without the need for specialized pre-training. Implemented in a realistic simulation environment, shenlong ensures compatibility with existing graphics pipelines. To accurately assess the impact of CGA, we benchmark against robust Euclidean Space baselines, evaluating both latency and accuracy. Comparative performance evaluations indicate that shenlong significantly reduces LLM response times by 16% and boosts success rates by 9.6% on average compared to the traditional methods. Notably, shenlong achieves a 100% perfect success rate in common practical queries, a benchmark where other systems fall short. These advancements underscore shenlong's potential to democratize 3D scene editing, enhancing accessibility and fostering innovation across sectors such as education, digital entertainment, and virtual reality.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |

However, self-contradictory instructions may arise due to the increasing trend of multimodal interaction and context length, which is challenging for language beginners and vulnerable populations. We introduce the Self-Contradictory Instructions benchmark to evaluate the capability of LMMs in recognizing conflicting commands. It comprises 20,000 conflicts, evenly distributed between language and vision paradigms. It is constructed by a novel automatic dataset creation framework, which expedites the process and enables us to encompass a wide range of instruction forms. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals current LMMs consistently struggle to identify multimodal instruction discordance due to a lack of self-awareness. Hence, we propose the Cognitive Awakening Prompting to inject cognition from external, largely enhancing dissonance detection.

While commercial LLMs like ChatGPT have dominated this domain, open-source alternatives have lagged considerably in performance, limiting the flexibility and data privacy of this emerging technology. This study introduces a novel approach utilizing reinforcement learning with golden code feedback to enhance the performance of pre-trained models. Leveraging open-source data and base models, we have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) results with a substantial margin. Notably, our 6.7B parameter model \ours{} demonstrates superior performance compared to current best-in-class 13B and 16B models. Furthermore, through a comprehensive analysis of the limitations in direct fine-tuning and the training dynamics of reinforcement learning, we posit that the development of comprehensive supervisory signals, which are align with the inherent parallel semantics of Verilog code, is critical to effective generation.

| **[Self-Enhancing Video Data Management System for Compositional Events with Large Language Models [Technical Report]](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02243v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex video queries can be answered by decomposing them into modular subtasks. However, existing video data management systems assume the existence of predefined modules for each subtask. We introduce VOCAL-UDF, a novel self-enhancing system that supports compositional queries over videos without the need for predefined modules. VOCAL-UDF automatically identifies and constructs missing modules and encapsulates them as user-defined functions (UDFs), thus expanding its querying capabilities. To achieve this, we formulate a unified UDF model that leverages large language models (LLMs) to aid in new UDF generation. VOCAL-UDF handles a wide range of concepts by supporting both program-based UDFs (i.e., Python functions generated by LLMs) and distilled-model UDFs (lightweight vision models distilled from strong pretrained models). To resolve the inherent ambiguity in user intent, VOCAL-UDF generates multiple candidate UDFs and uses active learning to efficiently select the best one. With the self-enhancing capability, VOCAL-UDF significantly improves query performance across three video datasets.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging recent advancements in data availability and efficient fine-tuning, BOTS-LM achieves performance similar to models significantly larger than itself while maintaining computational efficiency. Our initial release features an 8 billion parameter generative large language model, with upcoming 0.5 billion and 1 billion parameter large language models and a 278 million parameter encoder-only model soon to be released. We find the 8 billion parameter model significantly outperforms Llama-3-70B and Aya 23 on English-Setswana translation tasks, approaching the performance of dedicated machine translation models, while approaching 70B parameter performance on Setswana reasoning as measured by a machine translated subset of the MMLU benchmark. To accompany the BOTS-LM series of language models, we release the largest Setswana web dataset, SetsText, totalling over 267 million tokens. In addition, we release the largest machine translated Setswana dataset, the first and largest synthetic Setswana dataset, training and evaluation code, training logs, and MMLU-tsn, a machine translated subset of MMLU.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 tables |

A Comparative Study in Low-Resource Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02237v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant interest in natural language processing (NLP), particularly their remarkable performance in various downstream tasks in resource-rich languages. Recent studies have highlighted the limitations of LLMs in low-resource languages, primarily focusing on binary classification tasks and giving minimal attention to South Asian languages. These limitations are primarily attributed to constraints such as dataset scarcity, computational costs, and research gaps specific to low-resource languages. To address this gap, we present datasets for sentiment and hate speech tasks by translating from English to Bangla, Hindi, and Urdu, facilitating research in low-resource language processing. Further, we comprehensively examine zero-shot learning using multiple LLMs in English and widely spoken South Asian languages. Our findings indicate that GPT-4 consistently outperforms Llama 2 and Gemini, with English consistently demonstrating superior performance across diverse tasks compared to low-resource languages. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that natural language inference (NLI) exhibits the highest performance among the evaluated tasks, with GPT-4 demonstrating superior capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model Aided QoS Prediction for Service Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02223v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid improvement in the recent years, and are used in a wider range of applications. After being trained on large text corpus, LLMs obtain the capability of extracting rich features from textual data. Such capability is potentially useful for the web service recommendation task, where the web users and services have intrinsic attributes that can be described using natural language sentences and are useful for recommendation. In this paper, we explore the possibility and practicality of using LLMs for web service recommendation. We propose the large language model aided QoS prediction (llmQoS) model, which use LLMs to extract useful information from attributes of web users and services via descriptive sentences. This information is then used in combination with the QoS values of historical interactions of users and services, to predict QoS values for any given user-service pair. Our proposed model is shown to overcome the data sparsity issue for QoS prediction. We show that on the WSDream dataset, llmQoS outperforms comparable baseline models consistently.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reliable Academic Conference Question Answering: A Study Based on Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13028v2)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the development of academic conferences fosters global scholarly communication, researchers consistently need to obtain accurate and up-to-date information about academic conferences. Since the information is scattered, using an intelligent question-answering system to efficiently handle researchers' queries and ensure awareness of the latest advancements is necessary. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in question answering, and have been enhanced by retrieving external knowledge to deal with outdated knowledge. However, these methods fail to work due to the lack of the latest conference knowledge. To address this challenge, we develop the ConferenceQA dataset, consisting of seven diverse academic conferences. Specifically, for each conference, we first organize academic conference data in a tree-structured format through a semi-automated method. Then we annotate question-answer pairs and classify the pairs into four different types to better distinguish their difficulty. With the constructed dataset, we further propose a novel method STAR (STructure-Aware Retrieval) to improve the question-answering abilities of LLMs, leveraging inherent structural information during the retrieval process. Experimental results on the ConferenceQA dataset show the effectiveness of our retrieval method. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/zjukg/ConferenceQA.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

A Comprehensive Experimental Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02213v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knob tuning plays a crucial role in optimizing databases by adjusting knobs to enhance database performance. However, traditional tuning methods often follow a Try-Collect-Adjust approach, proving inefficient and database-specific. Moreover, these methods are often opaque, making it challenging for DBAs to grasp the underlying decision-making process. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Claude-3 has excelled in complex natural language tasks, yet their potential in database knob tuning remains largely unexplored. This study harnesses LLMs as experienced DBAs for knob-tuning tasks with carefully designed prompts. We identify three key subtasks in the tuning system: knob pruning, model initialization, and knob recommendation, proposing LLM-driven solutions to replace conventional methods for each subtask. We conduct extensive experiments to compare LLM-driven approaches against traditional methods across the subtasks to evaluate LLMs' efficacy in the knob tuning domain. Furthermore, we explore the adaptability of LLM-based solutions in diverse evaluation settings, encompassing new benchmarks, database engines, and hardware environments. Our findings reveal that LLMs not only match or surpass traditional methods but also exhibit notable interpretability by generating responses in a coherent ``chain-of-thought'' manner. We further observe that LLMs exhibit remarkable generalizability through simple adjustments in prompts, eliminating the necessity for additional training or extensive code modifications. Drawing insights from our experimental findings, we identify several opportunities for future research aimed at advancing the utilization of LLMs in the realm of database management.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large-scale Deployment of Vision-based Tactile Sensors on Multi-fingered Grippers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02206v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-based Tactile Sensors (VBTSs) show significant promise in that they can leverage image measurements to provide high-spatial-resolution human-like performance. However, current VBTS designs, typically confined to the fingertips of robotic grippers, prove somewhat inadequate, as many grasping and manipulation tasks require multiple contact points with the object. With an end goal of enabling large-scale, multi-surface tactile sensing via VBTSs, our research (i) develops a synchronized image acquisition system with minimal latency,(ii) proposes a modularized VBTS design for easy integration into finger phalanges, and (iii) devises a zero-shot calibration approach to improve data efficiency in the simultaneous calibration of multiple VBTSs. In validating the system within a miniature 3-fingered robotic gripper equipped with 7 VBTSs we demonstrate improved tactile perception performance by covering the contact surfaces of both gripper fingers and palm. Additionally, we show that our VBTS design can be seamlessly integrated into various end-effector morphologies significantly reducing the data requirements for calibration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating the Performance of Large Language Models for SDG Mapping (Technical Report)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02201v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of large language models (LLMs) is expanding rapidly, and open-source versions are becoming available, offering users safer and more adaptable options. These models enable users to protect data privacy by eliminating the need to provide data to third parties and can be customized for specific tasks. In this study, we compare the performance of various language models on the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) mapping task, using the output of GPT-4o as the baseline. The selected open-source models for comparison include Mixtral, LLaMA 2, LLaMA 3, Gemma, and Qwen2. Additionally, GPT-4o-mini, a more specialized version of GPT-4o, was included to extend the comparison. Given the multi-label nature of the SDG mapping task, we employed metrics such as F1 score, precision, and recall with micro-averaging to evaluate different aspects of the models' performance. These metrics are derived from the confusion matrix to ensure a comprehensive evaluation. We provide a clear observation and analysis of each model's performance by plotting curves based on F1 score, precision, and recall at different thresholds. According to the results of this experiment, LLaMA 2 and Gemma still have significant room for improvement. The other four models do not exhibit particularly large differences in performance. The outputs from all seven models are available on Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12789375.</p></details> |  |

Existing motion prediction approaches have ample room for improvement, particularly in terms of long-term prediction accuracy and interpretability. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing LC-LLM, an explainable lane change prediction model that leverages the strong reasoning capabilities and self-explanation abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Essentially, we reformulate the lane change prediction task as a language modeling problem, processing heterogeneous driving scenario information as natural language prompts for LLMs and employing supervised fine-tuning to tailor LLMs specifically for lane change prediction task. Additionally, we finetune the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve prediction transparency and reliability, and include explanatory requirements in the prompts during inference stage. Therefore, our LC-LLM model not only predicts lane change intentions and trajectories but also provides CoT reasoning and explanations for its predictions, enhancing its interpretability. Extensive experiments based on the large-scale highD dataset demonstrate the superior performance and interpretability of our LC-LLM in lane change prediction task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize LLMs for predicting lane change behavior. Our study shows that LLMs can effectively encode comprehensive interaction information for driving behavior understanding.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

However, MLLMs occasionally generate content inconsistent with the given images, which is known as "hallucination". Prior works primarily center on evaluating hallucination using standard, unperturbed benchmarks, which overlook the prevalent occurrence of perturbed inputs in real-world scenarios-such as image cropping or blurring-that are critical for a comprehensive assessment of MLLMs' hallucination. In this paper, to bridge this gap, we propose Hallu-PI, the first benchmark designed to evaluate Hallucination in MLLMs within Perturbed Inputs. Specifically, Hallu-PI consists of seven perturbed scenarios, containing 1,260 perturbed images from 11 object types. Each image is accompanied by detailed annotations, which include fine-grained hallucination types, such as existence, attribute, and relation. We equip these annotations with a rich set of questions, making Hallu-PI suitable for both discriminative and generative tasks. Extensive experiments on 12 mainstream MLLMs, such as GPT-4V and Gemini-Pro Vision, demonstrate that these models exhibit significant hallucinations on Hallu-PI, which is not observed in unperturbed scenarios. Furthermore, our research reveals a severe bias in MLLMs' ability to handle different types of hallucinations. We also design two baselines specifically for perturbed scenarios, namely Perturbed-Reminder and Perturbed-ICL. We hope that our study will bring researchers' attention to the limitations of MLLMs when dealing with perturbed inputs, and spur further investigations to address this issue. Our code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/Hallu-PI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accce...</summary><p>Acccepted by ACM MM 2024, 14 pages, 11 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

Unlike fairness in traditional machine learning, fairness in LLMs involves unique backgrounds, taxonomies, and fulfillment techniques. This tutorial provides a systematic overview of recent advances in the literature concerning fair LLMs, beginning with real-world case studies to introduce LLMs, followed by an analysis of bias causes therein. The concept of fairness in LLMs is then explored, summarizing the strategies for evaluating bias and the algorithms designed to promote fairness. Additionally, resources for assessing bias in LLMs, including toolkits and datasets, are compiled, and current research challenges and open questions in the field are discussed.

| **[Embedding generalization within the learning dynamics: An approach based-on sample path large deviation theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02167v1)** | 2024-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a typical learning problem of point estimations for modeling of nonlinear functions or dynamical systems in which generalization, i.e., verifying a given learned model, can be embedded as an integral part of the learning process or dynamics. In particular, we consider an empirical risk minimization based learning problem that exploits gradient methods from continuous-time perspective with small random perturbations, which is guided by the training dataset loss. Here, we provide an asymptotic probability estimate in the small noise limit based-on the Freidlin-Wentzell theory of large deviations, when the sample path of the random process corresponding to the randomly perturbed gradient dynamical system hits a certain target set, i.e., a rare event, when the latter is specified by the testing dataset loss landscape. Interestingly, the proposed framework can be viewed as one way of improving generalization and robustness in learning problems that provides new insights leading to optimal point estimates which is guided by training data loss, while, at the same time, the learning dynamics has an access to the testing dataset loss landscape in some form of future achievable or anticipated target goal. Moreover, as a by-product, we establish a connection with optimal control problem, where the target set, i.e., the rare event, is considered as the desired outcome or achievable target goal for a certain optimal control problem, for which we also provide a verification result reinforcing the rationale behind the proposed framework. Finally, we present a computational algorithm that solves the corresponding variational problem leading to an optimal point estimates and, as part of this work, we also present some numerical results for a typical case of nonlinear regression problem.</p></details> | 13 Pages |

However, even with the widespread use of contemporary Computer-Aided Design (CAD) systems, there are still high learning costs, repetitive work, and other challenges. In recent years, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced new productivity opportunities to the field of mechanical design. Yet, it remains unrealistic to rely on LLMs alone to complete mechanical design tasks directly. Through a series of explorations, we propose a method for constructing a comprehensive Mechanical Design Agent (MDA) by guiding LLM learning. To verify the validity of our proposed method, we conducted a series of experiments and presented relevant cases.</p></details> |  |

However, few approaches has been made toward a complete AI-powered tutoring system. In this work, we explore the development of a full-fledged intelligent tutoring system powered by state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), covering automatic course planning and adjusting, tailored instruction, and flexible quiz evaluation. To make the system robust to prolonged interaction and cater to individualized education, the system is decomposed into three inter-connected core processes-interaction, reflection, and reaction. Each process is implemented by chaining LLM-powered tools along with dynamically updated memory modules. Tools are LLMs prompted to execute one specific task at a time, while memories are data storage that gets updated during education process. Statistical results from learning logs demonstrate the effectiveness and mechanism of each tool usage. Subjective feedback from human users reveal the usability of each function, and comparison with ablation systems further testify the benefits of the designed processes in long-term interaction.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods mitigate this issue mainly from two perspectives: One approach leverages extra knowledge like robust instruction tuning LVLMs with curated datasets or employing auxiliary analysis networks, which inevitable incur additional costs. Another approach, known as contrastive decoding, induces hallucinations by manually disturbing the vision or instruction raw inputs and mitigates them by contrasting the outputs of the disturbed and original LVLMs. However, these approaches rely on empirical holistic input disturbances and double the inference cost. To avoid these issues, we propose a simple yet effective method named Self-Introspective Decoding (SID). Our empirical investigation reveals that pretrained LVLMs can introspectively assess the importance of vision tokens based on preceding vision and text (both instruction and generated) tokens. We develop the Context and Text-aware Token Selection (CT2S) strategy, which preserves only unimportant vision tokens after early layers of LVLMs to adaptively amplify text-informed hallucination during the auto-regressive decoding. This approach ensures that multimodal knowledge absorbed in the early layers induces multimodal contextual rather than aimless hallucinations. Subsequently, the original token logits subtract the amplified vision-and-text association hallucinations, guiding LVLMs decoding faithfully. Extensive experiments illustrate SID generates less-hallucination and higher-quality texts across various metrics, without extra knowledge and much additional computation burdens.</p></details> |  |

The task of association rule mining successfully discovers regular patterns in item sets and substructures. Still, to our best knowledge, this concept has not yet been extended to path patterns in large property graphs. In this paper, we introduce the problem of path association rule mining (PARM). Applied to any \emph{reachability path} between two vertices within a large graph, PARM discovers regular ways in which path patterns, identified by vertex attributes and edge labels, co-occur with each other. We develop an efficient and scalable algorithm PIONEER that exploits an anti-monotonicity property to effectively prune the search space. Further, we devise approximation techniques and employ parallelization to achieve scalable path association rule mining. Our experimental study using real-world graph data verifies the significance of path association rules and the efficiency of our solutions.</p></details> |  |

However, the multimodal SC has several challenges, including data heterogeneity, semantic ambiguity, and signal distortion during transmission. Recent advancements in large AI models, particularly in the Multimodal Language Model (MLM) and Large Language Model (LLM), offer potential solutions for addressing these issues. To this end, we propose a Large AI Model-based Multimodal SC (LAM-MSC) framework, where we first present the MLM-based Multimodal Alignment (MMA) that utilizes the MLM to enable the transformation between multimodal and unimodal data while preserving semantic consistency. Then, a personalized LLM-based Knowledge Base (LKB) is proposed, which allows users to perform personalized semantic extraction or recovery through the LLM. This effectively addresses the semantic ambiguity. Finally, we apply the Conditional Generative adversarial network-based channel Estimation (CGE) for estimating the wireless channel state information. This approach effectively mitigates the impact of fading channels in SC. Finally, we conduct simulations that demonstrate the superior performance of the LAM-MSC framework.</p></details> | Accepted by IEEE CM |

Developing an e-commerce shopping assistant for customers is crucial to aiding them in quickly finding desired products and recommending precisely what they need. However, most previous shopping assistants face two main problems: (1) task-specificity, which necessitates the development of different models for various tasks, thereby increasing development costs and limiting effectiveness; and (2) poor generalization, where the trained model performs inadequately on up-to-date products. To resolve these issues, we employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct an omnipotent assistant, leveraging their adeptness at handling multiple tasks and their superior generalization capability. Nonetheless, LLMs lack inherent knowledge of e-commerce concepts. To address this, we create an instruction dataset comprising 65,000 samples and diverse tasks, termed as EshopInstruct. Through instruction tuning on our dataset, the assistant, named LLaSA, demonstrates the potential to function as an omnipotent assistant. Additionally, we propose various inference optimization strategies to enhance performance with limited inference resources. In the Amazon KDD Cup 2024 Challenge, our proposed method, LLaSA, achieved an overall ranking of 3rd place on ShopBench, including 57 tasks and approximately 20,000 questions, and we secured top-5 rankings in each track, especially in track4, where we achieved the best performance result among all student teams.

To address this gap, we initially introduce a collection of supervised learning tasks, augmented with labels derived from a conventional recommender model, aimed at explicitly improving LLMs' proficiency in adhering to recommendation-specific instructions. Subsequently, we develop a reinforcement learning-based alignment procedure to further strengthen LLMs' aptitude in responding to users' intentions and mitigating formatting errors. Through extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, our method markedly advances the capability of LLMs to comply with instructions within recommender systems, while sustaining a high level of accuracy performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages; Accepted by ACL 2024 main conference</p></details> |
| **[A Chinese Dataset for Evaluating the Safeguards in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12193v3)** | 2024-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many studies have demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can produce harmful responses, exposing users to unexpected risks when LLMs are deployed. Previous studies have proposed comprehensive taxonomies of the risks posed by LLMs, as well as corresponding prompts that can be used to examine the safety mechanisms of LLMs. However, the focus has been almost exclusively on English, and little has been explored for other languages. Here we aim to bridge this gap. We first introduce a dataset for the safety evaluation of Chinese LLMs, and then extend it to two other scenarios that can be used to better identify false negative and false positive examples in terms of risky prompt rejections. We further present a set of fine-grained safety assessment criteria for each risk type, facilitating both manual annotation and automatic evaluation in terms of LLM response harmfulness. Our experiments on five LLMs show that region-specific risks are the prevalent type of risk, presenting the major issue with all Chinese LLMs we experimented with.

Robustness here refers to the relative insensitivity of the model's answers to meaning-preserving variants of their input. Benchmark datasets are constructed by introducing naturally-occurring, non-malicious perturbations, or by generating semantically equivalent paraphrases of input questions or statements. We further propose a novel metric for assessing a model robustness, and demonstrate its benefits in the non-adversarial scenario by empirical evaluation of several models on the created datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiReCT: Diagnostic Reasoning for Clinical Notes via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01933v1)** | 2024-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently showcased remarkable capabilities, spanning a wide range of tasks and applications, including those in the medical domain. Models like GPT-4 excel in medical question answering but may face challenges in the lack of interpretability when handling complex tasks in real clinical settings. We thus introduce the diagnostic reasoning dataset for clinical notes (DiReCT), aiming at evaluating the reasoning ability and interpretability of LLMs compared to human doctors. It contains 521 clinical notes, each meticulously annotated by physicians, detailing the diagnostic reasoning process from observations in a clinical note to the final diagnosis. Additionally, a diagnostic knowledge graph is provided to offer essential knowledge for reasoning, which may not be covered in the training data of existing LLMs. Evaluations of leading LLMs on DiReCT bring out a significant gap between their reasoning ability and that of human doctors, highlighting the critical need for models that can reason effectively in real-world clinical scenarios.</p></details> | 9 pages,6 figures |
| **[Multistage Collaborative Knowledge Distillation from a Large Language Model for Semi-Supervised Sequence Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08640v4)** | 2024-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study semi-supervised sequence generation tasks, where the few labeled examples are too scarce to finetune a model, and meanwhile, few-shot prompted large language models (LLMs) exhibit room for improvement. In this paper, we present the discovery that a student model distilled from a few-shot prompted LLM can commonly generalize better than its teacher to unseen examples on such tasks. We find that the student is able to learn a general pattern from the high-quality pseudolabels produced by the teacher during knowledge distillation (KD), and favorably not a general pattern from the low-quality pseudolables. Leveraging this discovery, we propose a new method, Multistage Collaborative Knowledge Distillation from an LLM (MCKD), for these tasks. MCKD first few-shot prompts an LLM to produce pseudolabels for unlabeled data. Then at each stage of an iterative KD process, a new pair of students is trained on disjoint partitions of the pseudolabeled data, and produces new and improved pseudolabels for their unseen partitions. We conduct extensive experiments on four syntactic and semantic parsing datasets and show the effectiveness of MCKD for low-resource semi-supervised sequence generation. On CRAFT biomedical parsing, for example, 3-stage MCKD with 50 labeled examples outperforms an LLM teacher and vanilla KD by 7.5% and 3.7% parsing F1, respectively, and matches the performance of supervised finetuning with 500 labeled examples.</p></details> | ACL 2024 |
| **[Cross-layer Attention Sharing for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01890v1)** | 2024-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) evolve, the increase in model depth and parameter number leads to substantial redundancy. To enhance the efficiency of the attention mechanism, previous works primarily compress the KV cache or group attention heads, while largely overlooking redundancy between layers. Our comprehensive analyses across various LLMs show that highly similar attention patterns persist within most layers. It's intuitive to save the computation by sharing attention weights across layers. However, further analysis reveals two challenges: (1) Directly sharing the weight matrix without carefully rearranging the attention heads proves to be ineffective; (2) Shallow layers are vulnerable to small deviations in attention weights. Driven by these insights, we introduce LiSA, a lightweight substitute for self-attention in well-trained LLMs. LiSA employs tiny feed-forward networks to align attention heads between adjacent layers and low-rank matrices to approximate differences in layer-wise attention weights. Evaluations encompassing 13 typical benchmarks demonstrate that LiSA maintains high response quality in terms of accuracy and perplexity while reducing redundant attention calculations within 53-84% of the total layers. Our implementations of LiSA achieve a 6X compression of Q and K, with maximum throughput improvements of 19.5% for LLaMA3-8B and 32.3% for LLaMA2-7B.</p></details> | Working in process |

Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) demonstrate outstanding performance in generalist modeling and out-of-domain generalizability in many fields. Toward fully unleashing their power for e-commerce, in this paper, we construct ECInstruct, the first open-sourced, large-scale, and high-quality benchmark instruction dataset for e-commerce. Leveraging ECInstruct, we develop eCeLLM, a series of e-commerce LLMs, by instruction-tuning general-purpose LLMs. Our comprehensive experiments and evaluation demonstrate that eCeLLM models substantially outperform baseline models, including the most advanced GPT-4, and the state-of-the-art task-specific models in in-domain evaluation. Moreover, eCeLLM exhibits excellent generalizability to out-of-domain settings, including unseen products and unseen instructions, highlighting its superiority as a generalist e-commerce model. Both the ECInstruct dataset and the eCeLLM models show great potential in empowering versatile and effective LLMs for e-commerce. ECInstruct and eCeLLM models are publicly accessible through https://ninglab.github.io/eCeLLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024; Bo Peng and Xinyi Ling contributed equally to this paper</p></details> |
| **[On the Self-Verification Limitations of Large Language Models on Reasoning and Planning Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08115v2)** | 2024-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been considerable divergence of opinion on the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). While the initial optimism that reasoning might emerge automatically with scale has been tempered thanks to a slew of counterexamples--ranging from multiplication to simple planning--there persists a wide spread belief that LLMs can self-critique and improve their own solutions in an iterative fashion. This belief seemingly rests on the assumption that verification of correctness should be easier than generation--a rather classical argument from computational complexity--which should be irrelevant to LLMs to the extent that what they are doing is approximate retrieval. In this paper, we set out to systematically investigate the effectiveness of iterative prompting in the context of reasoning and planning. We present a principled empirical study of the performance of GPT-4 in three domains: Game of 24, Graph Coloring, and STRIPS planning. We experiment both with the model critiquing its own answers and with an external correct reasoner verifying proposed solutions. In each case, we analyze whether the content of criticisms actually affects bottom line performance, and whether we can ablate elements of the augmented system without losing performance. We observe significant performance collapse with self-critique and significant performance gains with sound external verification. We also note that merely re-prompting with a sound verifier maintains most of the benefits of more involved setups.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2310.12397</p></details> |

One-shot pruning techniques offer a way to alleviate these burdens by removing redundant weights without the need for retraining. Yet, the massive scale of LLMs often forces current pruning approaches to rely on heuristics instead of optimization-based techniques, potentially resulting in suboptimal compression. In this paper, we introduce ALPS, an optimization-based framework that tackles the pruning problem using the operator splitting technique and a preconditioned conjugate gradient-based post-processing step. Our approach incorporates novel techniques to accelerate and theoretically guarantee convergence while leveraging vectorization and GPU parallelism for efficiency. ALPS substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of the pruning objective and perplexity reduction, particularly for highly sparse models. On the OPT-30B model with 70% sparsity, ALPS achieves a 13% reduction in test perplexity on the WikiText dataset and a 19% improvement in zero-shot benchmark performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

A natural concern is that during multimodal interaction, the generated hallucinations could influence the LVLMs' subsequent generation. Thus, we raise a question: When presented with a query relevant to the previously generated hallucination, will LVLMs be misled and respond incorrectly, even though the ground visual information exists? To answer this, we propose a framework called MMHalSnowball to evaluate LVLMs' behaviors when encountering generated hallucinations, where LVLMs are required to answer specific visual questions within a curated hallucinatory conversation. Crucially, our experiment shows that the performance of open-source LVLMs drops by at least $31\%$, indicating that LVLMs are prone to accept the generated hallucinations and make false claims that they would not have supported without distractions. We term this phenomenon Multimodal Hallucination Snowballing. To mitigate this, we further propose a training-free method called Residual Visual Decoding, where we revise the output distribution of LVLMs with the one derived from the residual visual input, providing models with direct access to the visual information. Experiments show that our method can mitigate more than $24\%$ of the snowballed multimodal hallucination while maintaining capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2024 Main Conference. 21 pages, 20 figures</p></details> |

Various goals can be achieved with the proposed framework, such as improving the readability of the diarized transcript, or reducing the word diarization error rate (WDER). In this framework, the outputs of the automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speaker diarization systems are represented as a compact textual format, which is included in the prompt to an optionally finetuned LLM. The outputs of the LLM can be used as the refined diarization results with the desired enhancement. As a post-processing step, this framework can be easily applied to any off-the-shelf ASR and speaker diarization systems without retraining existing components. Our experiments show that a finetuned PaLM 2-S model can reduce the WDER by rel. 55.5% on the Fisher telephone conversation dataset, and rel. 44.9% on the Callhome English dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large AI Model-Based Semantic Communications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03492v2)** | 2024-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic communication (SC) is an emerging intelligent paradigm, offering solutions for various future applications like metaverse, mixed reality, and the Internet of Everything. However, in current SC systems, the construction of the knowledge base (KB) faces several issues, including limited knowledge representation, frequent knowledge updates, and insecure knowledge sharing. Fortunately, the development of the large AI model (LAM) provides new solutions to overcome the above issues. Here, we propose a LAM-based SC framework (LAM-SC) specifically designed for image data, where we first apply the segment anything model (SAM)-based KB (SKB) that can split the original image into different semantic segments by universal semantic knowledge. Then, we present an attention-based semantic integration (ASI) to weigh the semantic segments generated by SKB without human participation and integrate them as the semantic aware image. Additionally, we propose an adaptive semantic compression (ASC) encoding to remove redundant information in semantic features, thereby reducing communication overhead. Finally, through simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the LAM-SC framework and the possibility of applying the LAM-based KB in future SC paradigms.</p></details> | Accepted by IEEE WCM |

However, traditional offloading architectures face several issues, including heterogeneous constraints, partial perception, uncertain generalization, and lack of tractability. In this paper, we propose a Large AI Model-Based Offloading (LAMBO) framework with over one billion parameters for solving these problems. We first use input embedding (IE) to achieve normalized feature representation with heterogeneous constraints and task prompts. Then, we introduce a novel asymmetric encoder-decoder (AED) as the decision-making model, which is an improved transformer architecture consisting of a deep encoder and a shallow decoder for global perception and decision. Next, actor-critic learning (ACL) is used to pre-train the AED for different optimization tasks under corresponding prompts, enhancing the AED's generalization in multi-task scenarios. Finally, we propose an active learning from expert feedback (ALEF) method to fine-tune the decoder of the AED for tracking changes in dynamic environments. Our simulation results validate the advantages of the proposed LAMBO framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Communications Magazine</p></details> |

However, the reasoning ability of LLM is still very limited when it comes to mathematical reasoning. Mathematics plays an important role in all aspects of human society and is a technical guarantee in the fields of healthcare, transport and aerospace, for this reason, the development of AI big language models in the field of mathematics has great potential significance. To improve the mathematical reasoning ability of large language models, we proposed an agent framework for learning to solve mathematical problems based on inductive reasoning. By emulating the human learning process of generalization of learned information and effective application of previous knowledge in new reasoning tasks, this framework has great performance in the mathematical reasoning process. It improves global accuracy over the baseline method (chain-of-thought) by 20.96% and solves 17.54% of the mathematical problems that the baseline cannot solve. Benefiting from the efficient RETRIEVAL method, our model improves the ability of large language models to efficiently use external knowledge, i.e., the mathematical computation of the model can be based on written procedures. In education, our model can be used as a personalised learning aid, thus reducing the inequality of educational resources.</p></details> |  |

However, existing graph data structures cannot simultaneously address the performance bottlenecks caused by the dynamic updates, large scale, and high query complexity of current graphs. This paper proposes a novel data structure for large-scale dynamic graphs called CuckooGraph. It does not require any prior knowledge of the upcoming graphs, and can adaptively resize to the most memory-efficient form while requiring few memory accesses for very fast graph data processing. The key techniques of CuckooGraph include TRANSFORMATION and DENYLIST. TRANSFORMATION fully utilizes the limited memory by designing related data structures that allow flexible space transformations to smoothly expand/tighten the required space depending on the number of incoming items. DENYLIST efficiently handles item insertion failures and further improves processing speed. Our experimental results show that compared with the most competitive solution Spruce, CuckooGraph achieves about $33\times$ higher insertion throughput while requiring only about $68\%$ of the memory space.</p></details> |  |

However, the presence of equivalent mutants is known to introduce redundant cost and bias issues, hindering the effectiveness of mutation testing in practical use. Although numerous equivalent mutant detection (EMD) techniques have been proposed, they exhibit limitations due to the scarcity of training data and challenges in generalizing to unseen mutants. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been extensively adopted in various code-related tasks and have shown superior performance by more accurately capturing program semantics. Yet the performance of LLMs in equivalent mutant detection remains largely unclear. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on 3,302 method-level Java mutant pairs to comprehensively investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of LLMs for equivalent mutant detection. Specifically, we assess the performance of LLMs compared to existing EMD techniques, examine the various strategies of LLMs, evaluate the orthogonality between EMD techniques, and measure the time overhead of training and inference. Our findings demonstrate that LLM-based techniques significantly outperform existing techniques (i.e., the average improvement of 35.69% in terms of F1-score), with the fine-tuned code embedding strategy being the most effective. Moreover, LLM-based techniques offer an excellent balance between cost (relatively low training and inference time) and effectiveness. Based on our findings, we further discuss the impact of model size and embedding quality, and provide several promising directions for future research. This work is the first to examine LLMs in equivalent mutant detection, affirming their effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ISSTA'2024</p></details> |

Although recent works have achieved promising performance, the lack of versatility and customization hinders their practical applications in broader scenarios. Therefore, this work presents a novel image outpainting framework that is capable of customizing the results according to the requirement of users. First of all, we take advantage of a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that automatically extracts and organizes the corresponding textual descriptions of the masked and unmasked part of a given image. Accordingly, the obtained text prompts are introduced to endow our model with the capacity to customize the outpainting results. In addition, a special Cross-Attention module, namely Center-Total-Surrounding (CTS), is elaborately designed to enhance further the the interaction between specific space regions of the image and corresponding parts of the text prompts. Note that unlike most existing methods, our approach is very resource-efficient since it is just slightly fine-tuned on the off-the-shelf stable diffusion (SD) model rather than being trained from scratch. Finally, the experimental results on three commonly used datasets, i.e. Scenery, Building, and WikiArt, demonstrate our model significantly surpasses the SoTA methods. Moreover, versatile outpainting results are listed to show its customized ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our s...</summary><p>Our source code is available at: https://github.com/ucasyjz/VIP, 15 pages</p></details> |

However, producing insightful and engaging commentary for complex games with incomplete information remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel commentary method that combine Reinforcement Learning (RL) and LLMs, tailored specifically for the Chinese card game \textit{Guandan}. Our system leverages RL to generate intricate card-playing scenarios and employs LLMs to generate corresponding commentary text, effectively emulating the strategic analysis and narrative prowess of professional commentators. The framework comprises a state commentary guide, a Theory of Mind (ToM)-based strategy analyzer, and a style retrieval module, which seamlessly collaborate to deliver detailed and context-relevant game commentary in the Chinese language environment. We empower LLMs with ToM capabilities and refine both retrieval and information filtering mechanisms. This facilitates the generation of personalized commentary content. Our experimental results showcase the substantial enhancement in performance achieved by the proposed commentary framework when applied to open-source LLMs, surpassing the performance of GPT-4 across multiple evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |

We consider a case study focused on test data related to electronic boards for satellites. To do so, we extend the Semantic Sensor Network ontology. We store the metadata of the reports in a KG, while the actual test results are stored in parquet accessible via a Virtual Knowledge Graph. The validation process is managed using an LLM-based approach. We also conduct a benchmarking study to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs in executing this task.

To deal with such risks, we introduce an innovative framework that can help evaluate the effectiveness of jailbreak attacks on LLMs. Unlike traditional binary evaluations focusing solely on the robustness of LLMs, our method assesses the effectiveness of the attacking prompts themselves. We present two distinct evaluation frameworks: a coarse-grained evaluation and a fine-grained evaluation. Each framework uses a scoring range from 0 to 1, offering unique perspectives and allowing for the assessment of attack effectiveness in different scenarios. Additionally, we develop a comprehensive ground truth dataset specifically tailored for jailbreak prompts. This dataset serves as a crucial benchmark for our current study and provides a foundational resource for future research. By comparing with traditional evaluation methods, our study shows that the current results align with baseline metrics while offering a more nuanced and fine-grained assessment. It also helps identify potentially harmful attack prompts that might appear harmless in traditional evaluations. Overall, our work establishes a solid foundation for assessing a broader range of attack prompts in the area of prompt injection.</p></details> | 34 pages, 6 figures |

However, current video grounding datasets merely focus on simple events and are either limited to shorter videos or brief sentences, which hinders the model from evolving toward stronger multimodal understanding capabilities. To address these limitations, we present a large-scale video grounding dataset named SynopGround, in which more than 2800 hours of videos are sourced from popular TV dramas and are paired with accurately localized human-written synopses. Each paragraph in the synopsis serves as a language query and is manually annotated with precise temporal boundaries in the long video. These paragraph queries are tightly correlated to each other and contain a wealth of abstract expressions summarizing video storylines and specific descriptions portraying event details, which enables the model to learn multimodal perception on more intricate concepts over longer context dependencies. Based on the dataset, we further introduce a more complex setting of video grounding dubbed Multi-Paragraph Video Grounding (MPVG), which takes as input multiple paragraphs and a long video for grounding each paragraph query to its temporal interval. In addition, we propose a novel Local-Global Multimodal Reasoner (LGMR) to explicitly model the local-global structures of long-term multimodal inputs for MPVG. Our method provides an effective baseline solution to the multi-paragraph video grounding problem. Extensive experiments verify the proposed model's effectiveness as well as its superiority in long-term multi-paragraph video grounding over prior state-of-the-arts.

| **[Large Multi-modality Model Assisted AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17762v2)** | 2024-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional deep neural network (DNN)-based image quality assessment (IQA) models leverage convolutional neural networks (CNN) or Transformer to learn the quality-aware feature representation, achieving commendable performance on natural scene images. However, when applied to AI-Generated images (AGIs), these DNN-based IQA models exhibit subpar performance. This situation is largely due to the semantic inaccuracies inherent in certain AGIs caused by uncontrollable nature of the generation process. Thus, the capability to discern semantic content becomes crucial for assessing the quality of AGIs. Traditional DNN-based IQA models, constrained by limited parameter complexity and training data, struggle to capture complex fine-grained semantic features, making it challenging to grasp the existence and coherence of semantic content of the entire image. To address the shortfall in semantic content perception of current IQA models, we introduce a large Multi-modality model Assisted AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment (MA-AGIQA) model, which utilizes semantically informed guidance to sense semantic information and extract semantic vectors through carefully designed text prompts. Moreover, it employs a mixture of experts (MoE) structure to dynamically integrate the semantic information with the quality-aware features extracted by traditional DNN-based IQA models. Comprehensive experiments conducted on two AI-generated content datasets, AIGCQA-20k and AGIQA-3k show that MA-AGIQA achieves state-of-the-art performance, and demonstrate its superior generalization capabilities on assessing the quality of AGIs.

While previous studies have made progress in optimizing model performance for single-round medical Q&A tasks, there is a need to enhance the model's capability for multi-round conversations to avoid logical inconsistencies. To address this, we propose an approach called preference learning from process feedback~(PLPF), which integrates the doctor's diagnostic logic into LLMs. PLPF involves rule modeling, preference data generation, and preference alignment to train the model to adhere to the diagnostic process. Experimental results using Standardized Patient Testing show that PLPF enhances the diagnostic accuracy of the baseline model in medical conversations by 17.6%, outperforming traditional reinforcement learning from human feedback. Additionally, PLPF demonstrates effectiveness in both multi-round and single-round dialogue tasks, showcasing its potential for improving medical dialogue generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL2024 Findings</p></details> |

The issue becomes even more noticeable when addressing logic queries that require multiple logic reasoning steps. On the other hand, knowledge graph (KG) based question answering methods are capable of accurately identifying the correct answers with the help of knowledge graph, yet its accuracy could quickly deteriorate when the knowledge graph itself is sparse and incomplete. It remains a critical challenge on how to integrate knowledge graph reasoning with LLMs in a mutually beneficial way so as to mitigate both the hallucination problem of LLMs as well as the incompleteness issue of knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose 'Logic-Query-of-Thoughts' (LGOT) which is the first of its kind to combine LLMs with knowledge graph based logic query reasoning. LGOT seamlessly combines knowledge graph reasoning and LLMs, effectively breaking down complex logic queries into easy to answer subquestions. Through the utilization of both knowledge graph reasoning and LLMs, it successfully derives answers for each subquestion. By aggregating these results and selecting the highest quality candidate answers for each step, LGOT achieves accurate results to complex questions. Our experimental findings demonstrate substantial performance enhancements, with up to 20% improvement over ChatGPT.</p></details> |  |

However, much of the research focuses on controlled datasets such as HumanEval, which fail to adequately represent how developers actually utilize LLMs' code generation capabilities or clarify the characteristics of LLM-generated code in real-world development scenarios. To bridge this gap, our study investigates the characteristics of LLM-generated code and its corresponding projects hosted on GitHub. Our findings reveal several key insights: (1) ChatGPT and Copilot are the most frequently utilized for generating code on GitHub. In contrast, there is very little code generated by other LLMs on GitHub. (2) Projects containing ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code are often small and less known, led by individuals or small teams. Despite this, most projects are continuously evolving and improving. (3) ChatGPT/Copilot is mainly utilized for generating Python, Java, and TypeScript scripts for data processing and transformation. C/C++ and JavaScript code generation focuses on algorithm and data structure implementation and user interface code. Most ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code snippets are relatively short and exhibit low complexity. (4) Compared to human-written code, ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code exists in a small proportion of projects and generally undergoes fewer modifications. Additionally, modifications due to bugs are even fewer, ranging from just 3% to 8% across different languages. (5) Most comments on ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code lack detailed information, often only stating the code's origin without mentioning prompts, human modifications, or testing status. Based on these findings, we discuss the implications for researchers and practitioners.</p></details> |  |

Traditional syntax-based log parsers are efficient and effective, but they often experience decreased accuracy when processing logs that deviate from the predefined rules. Recently, large language models (LLM) based log parsers have shown superior parsing accuracy. However, existing LLM-based parsers face three main challenges: 1)time-consuming and labor-intensive manual labeling for fine-tuning or in-context learning, 2)increased parsing costs due to the vast volume of log data and limited context size of LLMs, and 3)privacy risks from using commercial models like ChatGPT with sensitive log information. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces OpenLogParser, an unsupervised log parsing approach that leverages open-source LLMs (i.e., Llama3-8B) to enhance privacy and reduce operational costs while achieving state-of-the-art parsing accuracy. OpenLogParser first groups logs with similar static text but varying dynamic variables using a fixed-depth grouping tree. It then parses logs within these groups using three components: i)similarity scoring-based retrieval augmented generation: selects diverse logs within each group based on Jaccard similarity, helping the LLM distinguish between static text and dynamic variables; ii)self-reflection: iteratively query LLMs to refine log templates to improve parsing accuracy; and iii) log template memory: stores parsed templates to reduce LLM queries for improved parsing efficiency. Our evaluation on LogHub-2.0 shows that OpenLogParser achieves 25% higher parsing accuracy and processes logs 2.7 times faster compared to state-of-the-art LLM-based parsers. In short, OpenLogParser addresses privacy and cost concerns of using commercial LLMs while achieving state-of-the-arts parsing efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> |  |

This problem is NP-hard and arises in various practical applications. In this work, we present a novel algorithm that leverages graph neural networks to tackle the problem efficiently, particularly for large graphs. We propose a physics-inspired approach that leverages tools used in statistical mechanics to improve the training and performance of the algorithm. The scaling of our method is evaluated for different connectivities and graph sizes. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a dataset of Erdos-Renyi graphs, showing its applicability also in hard-to-solve connectivity regions where traditional methods struggle.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |

LLMs, whilst powerful and capable of demonstrating some emergent properties, are not logical reasoners and often struggle to perform well at all sub-tasks carried out by an AI agent to plan and execute a workflow. While existing studies tackle this lack of proficiency by generalised pretraining at a huge scale or by specialised fine-tuning for tool use, we assess if a system comprising of a coalition of pretrained LLMs, each exhibiting specialised performance at individual sub-tasks, can match the performance of single model agents. The coalition of models approach showcases its potential for building robustness and reducing the operational costs of these AI agents by leveraging traits exhibited by specific models. Our findings demonstrate that fine-tuning can be mitigated by considering a coalition of pretrained models and believe that this approach can be applied to other non-agentic systems which utilise LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comprehensive Review of Multimodal Large Language Models: Performance and Challenges Across Different Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01319v1)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In an era defined by the explosive growth of data and rapid technological advancements, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) stand at the forefront of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Designed to seamlessly integrate diverse data types-including text, images, videos, audio, and physiological sequences-MLLMs address the complexities of real-world applications far beyond the capabilities of single-modality systems. In this paper, we systematically sort out the applications of MLLM in multimodal tasks such as natural language, vision, and audio. We also provide a comparative analysis of the focus of different MLLMs in the tasks, and provide insights into the shortcomings of current MLLMs, and suggest potential directions for future research. Through these discussions, this paper hopes to provide valuable insights for the further development and application of MLLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs Plagiarize: Ensuring Responsible Sourcing of Large Language Model Training Data Through Knowledge Graph Comparison](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02659v2)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In light of recent legal allegations brought by publishers, newspapers, and other creators of copyrighted corpora against large language model developers who use their copyrighted materials for training or fine-tuning purposes, we propose a novel system, a variant of a plagiarism detection system, that assesses whether a knowledge source has been used in the training or fine-tuning of a large language model. Unlike current methods, we utilize an approach that uses Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples to create knowledge graphs from both a source document and an LLM continuation of that document. These graphs are then analyzed with respect to content using cosine similarity and with respect to structure using a normalized version of graph edit distance that shows the degree of isomorphism. Unlike traditional plagiarism systems that focus on content matching and keyword identification between a source and a target corpus, our approach enables a broader and more accurate evaluation of similarity between a source document and LLM continuation by focusing on relationships between ideas and their organization with regards to others. Additionally, our approach does not require access to LLM metrics like perplexity that may be unavailable in closed large language model "black-box" systems, as well as the training corpus. We thus assess whether an LLM has "plagiarized" a corpus in its continuation through similarity measures. A prototype of our system will be found on a hyperlinked GitHub repository.</p></details> |  |

Besides intensive computational requirements, conventional DSSE methods need high-quality measurements to obtain accurate states, whereas missing values often occur due to sensor failures or communication delays. To address these challenging issues, a forecast-then-estimate framework of edge learning is proposed for DSSE, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to forecast missing measurements and provide pseudo-measurements. Firstly, natural language-based prompts and measurement sequences are integrated by the proposed LLM to learn patterns from historical data and provide accurate forecasting results. Secondly, a convolutional layer-based neural network model is introduced to improve the robustness of state estimation under missing measurement. Thirdly, to alleviate the overfitting of the deep learning-based DSSE, it is reformulated as a multi-task learning framework containing shared and task-specific layers. The uncertainty weighting algorithm is applied to find the optimal weights to balance different tasks. The numerical simulation on the Simbench case is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed forecast-then-estimate framework.</p></details> |  |

Also, closed-source and larger open-source models generally offer better response quality but come with higher inference costs than smaller models. In this paper, we introduce Routoo, an architecture designed to optimize the selection of LLMs for specific prompts based on performance, cost, and efficiency. Routoo consists of two key components: a performance predictor and a cost-aware decoding. The performance predictor is a lightweight LLM that estimates the performance of various underlying LLMs without needing to execute and evaluate them. The cost-aware decoding then selects the most suitable model based on these predictions and other constraints like cost and latency. We evaluated Routoo using the MMLU benchmark across 57 domains employing open-source models. Our results show that Routoo matches the performance of the Mixtral 8x7b model while reducing inference costs by one-third. Additionally, by allowing increased costs, Routoo surpasses Mixtral's accuracy by over 5% at equivalent costs, achieving an accuracy of 75.9%. When integrating GPT4 into our model pool, Routoo nearly matches GPT4's performance at half the cost and exceeds it with a 25% cost reduction. These outcomes highlight Routoo's potential to create new SOTA in a cost-effective manner by leveraging the collective knowledge of multiple LLMs.</p></details> |  |

While several methods have been proposed for measuring bias, there remains a gap between predictions, which are what the proposed methods consider, and how they are used to make decisions. In this work, we introduce Rank-Allocational-Based Bias Index (RABBI), a model-agnostic bias measure that assesses potential allocational harms arising from biases in LLM predictions. We compare RABBI and current bias metrics on two allocation decision tasks. We evaluate their predictive validity across ten LLMs and utility for model selection. Our results reveal that commonly-used bias metrics based on average performance gap and distribution distance fail to reliably capture group disparities in allocation outcomes, whereas RABBI exhibits a strong correlation with allocation disparities. Our work highlights the need to account for how models are used in contexts with limited resource constraints.</p></details> |  |

This study evaluates the automation of phenotyping of clinical summaries from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database using large language models. Due to their rich phenotype data, these summaries can be surrogates for physician notes. We conduct a performance comparison of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo. Our results indicate that GPT-4 surpasses GPT-3.5-Turbo in identifying, categorizing, and normalizing signs, achieving concordance with manual annotators comparable to inter-rater agreement. Despite some limitations in sign normalization, the extensive pre-training of GPT-4 results in high performance and generalizability across several phenotyping tasks while obviating the need for manually annotated training data. Large language models are expected to be the dominant method for automating high-throughput phenotyping of clinical text.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI), Houston TX</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce a novel inference methodology termed next-sentence prediction, aimed at enhancing the inference efficiency of LLMs. We present Sentence Variational Autoencoder (SentenceVAE), a tiny model consisting of a Sentence Encoder and a Sentence Decoder. The encoder effectively condenses the information within a sentence into a singular token, while the decoder reconstructs this compressed data back into its original sentential form. By integrating SentenceVAE into the input and output layers of LLMs, we develop Sentence-level LLMs (SLLMs) that employ a sentence-by-sentence inference approach, markedly accelerating inference speeds. SentenceVAE also maintains the integrity of the original semantic content by segmenting the text into sentences, thereby improving accuracy while boosting inference speeds. Compared to published LLMs, SLLMs process fewer tokens over equivalent context lengths, significantly reducing memory demands for self-attention computations and facilitating the handling of longer contexts. Our experimental findings reveal that this method can accelerate inference speeds by 204~365%, reduce perplexity (PPL) to 46~75% of its original metric, and decrease memory overhead by 86~91% for the same context length, compared to the token-by-token method. Moreover, the benefits of this approach become even more pronounced as model parameters increase.</p></details> | <details><summary>Modif...</summary><p>Modified some of the expression details and optimized the charts</p></details> |

Large language models (LLMs) can ease this process by generating adaptive content for lesson plans, which would otherwise require teachers to create from scratch or search existing resources. In this work, we first conduct a formative study with six novice teachers to understand their needs for support of preparing lesson plans with LLMs. Then, we develop LessonPlanner that assists users to interactively construct lesson plans with adaptive LLM-generated content based on Gagne's nine events. Our within-subjects study (N=12) shows that compared to the baseline ChatGPT interface, LessonPlanner can significantly improve the quality of outcome lesson plans and ease users' workload in the preparation process. Our expert interviews (N=6) further demonstrate LessonPlanner's usefulness in suggesting effective teaching strategies and meaningful educational resources. We discuss concerns on and design considerations for supporting teaching activities with LLMs.</p></details> | 20 pages |

Extracting features from these reviews is essential for tasks such as feature prioritization and sentiment analysis, but it remains a challenging task. Meanwhile, encoder-only models based on the Transformer architecture have shown promising results for classification and information extraction tasks for multiple software engineering processes. This study explores the hypothesis that encoder-only large language models can enhance feature extraction from mobile app reviews. By leveraging crowdsourced annotations from an industrial context, we redefine feature extraction as a supervised token classification task. Our approach includes extending the pre-training of these models with a large corpus of user reviews to improve contextual understanding and employing instance selection techniques to optimize model fine-tuning. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that this method improves the precision and recall of extracted features and enhances performance efficiency. Key contributions include a novel approach to feature extraction, annotated datasets, extended pre-trained models, and an instance selection mechanism for cost-effective fine-tuning. This research provides practical methods and empirical evidence in applying large language models to natural language processing tasks within mobile app reviews, offering improved performance in feature extraction.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 8 tables, 11 figures</p></details> |

However, T2V generation still faces two important challenges: 1) Lacking a precise open sourced high-quality dataset. The previous popular video datasets, e.g. WebVid-10M and Panda-70M, are either with low quality or too large for most research institutions. Therefore, it is challenging but crucial to collect a precise high-quality text-video pairs for T2V generation. 2) Ignoring to fully utilize textual information. Recent T2V methods have focused on vision transformers, using a simple cross attention module for video generation, which falls short of thoroughly extracting semantic information from text prompt. To address these issues, we introduce OpenVid-1M, a precise high-quality dataset with expressive captions. This open-scenario dataset contains over 1 million text-video pairs, facilitating research on T2V generation. Furthermore, we curate 433K 1080p videos from OpenVid-1M to create OpenVidHD-0.4M, advancing high-definition video generation. Additionally, we propose a novel Multi-modal Video Diffusion Transformer (MVDiT) capable of mining both structure information from visual tokens and semantic information from text tokens. Extensive experiments and ablation studies verify the superiority of OpenVid-1M over previous datasets and the effectiveness of our MVDiT.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

To utilize these LLMs, inference engines are needed. These engines load the model's weights onto available resources, such as GPUs, and process queries to generate responses. The speed of inference, or performance, of the LLM, is critical for real-time applications, as it computes millions or billions of floating point operations per inference. Recently, advanced inference engines such as vLLM have emerged, incorporating novel mechanisms such as efficient memory management to achieve state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we analyze the performance, particularly the throughput (tokens generated per unit of time), of 20 LLMs using two inference libraries: vLLM and HuggingFace's pipelines. We investigate how various hyperparameters, which developers must configure, influence inference performance. Our results reveal that throughput landscapes are irregular, with distinct peaks, highlighting the importance of hyperparameter optimization to achieve maximum performance. We also show that applying hyperparameter optimization when upgrading or downgrading the GPU model used for inference can improve throughput from HuggingFace pipelines by an average of 9.16% and 13.7%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, hallucinations in MLLMs, where the generated text does not align with image content, continue to be a major challenge. Existing methods for addressing hallucinations often rely on instruction-tuning, which requires retraining the model with specific data, which increases the cost of utilizing MLLMs further. In this paper, we introduce a novel training-free method, named Piculet, for enhancing the input representation of MLLMs. Piculet leverages multiple specialized models to extract descriptions of visual information from the input image and combine these descriptions with the original image and query as input to the MLLM. We evaluate our method both quantitively and qualitatively, and the results demonstrate that Piculet greatly decreases hallucinations of MLLMs. Our method can be easily extended to different MLLMs while being universal.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

Consequently, the exploration of data management has attracted more and more attention among the research community. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current research in data management within both the pretraining and supervised fine-tuning stages of LLMs, covering various aspects of data management strategy design. Looking into the future, we extrapolate existing challenges and outline promising directions for development in this field.

Such requirements include both functional (i.e. achieving expected behavior for inputs) and non-functional (e.g., time/space performance, robustness, maintainability) requirements. However, textual descriptions can either express requirements verbosely or may even omit some of them. We introduce ARCHCODE, a novel framework that leverages in-context learning to organize requirements observed in descriptions and to extrapolate unexpressed requirements from them. ARCHCODE generates requirements from given descriptions, conditioning them to produce code snippets and test cases. Each test case is tailored to one of the requirements, allowing for the ranking of code snippets based on the compliance of their execution results with the requirements. Public benchmarks show that ARCHCODE enhances to satisfy functional requirements, significantly improving Pass@k scores. Furthermore, we introduce HumanEval-NFR, the first evaluation of LLMs' non-functional requirements in code generation, demonstrating ARCHCODE's superiority over baseline methods.

| **[A Multimodal Knowledge-enhanced Whole-slide Pathology Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15362v2)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remarkable strides in computational pathology have been made in the task-agnostic foundation model that advances the performance of a wide array of downstream clinical tasks. Despite the promising performance, there are still several challenges. First, prior works have resorted to either vision-only or vision-captions data, disregarding invaluable pathology reports and gene expression profiles which respectively offer distinct knowledge for versatile clinical applications. Second, the current progress in pathology FMs predominantly concentrates on the patch level, where the restricted context of patch-level pretraining fails to capture whole-slide patterns. Here we curated the largest multimodal dataset consisting of H\&E diagnostic whole slide images and their associated pathology reports and RNA-Seq data, resulting in 26,169 slide-level modality pairs from 10,275 patients across 32 cancer types. To leverage these data for CPath, we propose a novel whole-slide pretraining paradigm which injects multimodal knowledge at the whole-slide context into the pathology FM, called Multimodal Self-TAught PRetraining (mSTAR). The proposed paradigm revolutionizes the workflow of pretraining for CPath, which enables the pathology FM to acquire the whole-slide context. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate multimodal knowledge at the slide level for enhancing pathology FMs, expanding the modelling context from unimodal to multimodal knowledge and from patch-level to slide-level. To systematically evaluate the capabilities of mSTAR, extensive experiments including slide-level unimodal and multimodal applications, are conducted across 7 diverse types of tasks on 43 subtasks, resulting in the largest spectrum of downstream tasks. The average performance in various slide-level applications consistently demonstrates significant performance enhancements for mSTAR compared to SOTA FMs.</p></details> | 45 pages, 9 figures |

Some common limitations in MOT are varying object appearances, occlusions, or crowded scenes. To address these challenges, machine learning methods have been extensively deployed, leveraging large datasets, sophisticated models, and substantial computational resources. Due to practical limitations, access to the above is not always an option. However, with the recent release of foundation models by prominent AI companies, pretrained models have been trained on vast datasets and resources using state-of-the-art methods. This work tries to leverage one such foundation model, called DINOv2, through using knowledge distillation. The proposed method uses a teacher-student architecture, where DINOv2 is the teacher and the FairMOT backbone HRNetv2 W18 is the student. The results imply that although the proposed method shows improvements in certain scenarios, it does not consistently outperform the original FairMOT model. These findings highlight the potential and limitations of applying foundation models in knowledge</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an MSc thesis by Niels Faber, supervised by the two other authors</p></details> |

However, the fast-growing capabilities and autonomy have also raised significant concerns about responsible AI and AI safety. Recently, there have been increasing attention toward implementing guardrails to ensure the runtime behavior of FM-based systems is safe and responsible. Given the early stage of FMs and their applications (such as agents), the design of guardrails have not yet been systematically studied. It remains underexplored which software qualities should be considered when designing guardrails and how these qualities can be ensured from a software architecture perspective. Therefore, in this paper, we present a taxonomy for guardrails to classify and compare the characteristics and design options of guardrails. Our taxonomy is organized into three main categories: the motivation behind adopting runtime guardrails, the quality attributes to consider, and the design options available. This taxonomy provides structured and concrete guidance for making architectural design decisions when designing guardrails and highlights trade-offs arising from the design decisions.</p></details> | 15 Pages |
| **[Enhancing Whole Slide Pathology Foundation Models through Stain Normalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00380v2)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in digital pathology have led to the development of numerous foundational models that utilize self-supervised learning on patches extracted from gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs). While this approach leverages vast amounts of unlabeled data, we have discovered a significant issue: features extracted from these self-supervised models tend to cluster by individual WSIs, a phenomenon we term WSI-specific feature collapse. This problem can potentially limit the model's generalization ability and performance on various downstream tasks. To address this issue, we introduce Stain Normalized Pathology Foundational Model, a novel foundational model trained on patches that have undergone stain normalization. Stain normalization helps reduce color variability arising from different laboratories and scanners, enabling the model to learn more consistent features. Stain Normalized Pathology Foundational Model is trained using 285,153,903 patches extracted from a total of 34,795 WSIs, combining data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Our experiments demonstrate that Stain Normalized Pathology Foundational Model significantly mitigates the feature collapse problem, indicating that the model has learned more generalized features rather than overfitting to individual WSI characteristics. We compared Stain Normalized Pathology Foundational Model with state-of-the-art models across six downstream task datasets, and our results show that Stain Normalized Pathology Foundational Model achieves excellent performance relative to the number of WSIs used and the model's parameter count. This suggests that the application of stain normalization has substantially improved the model's efficiency and generalization capabilities.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Towards A Generalizable Pathology Foundation Model via Unified Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18449v2)** | 2024-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pretrained on large-scale datasets are revolutionizing the field of computational pathology (CPath). The generalization ability of foundation models is crucial for the success in various downstream clinical tasks. However, current foundation models have only been evaluated on a limited type and number of tasks, leaving their generalization ability and overall performance unclear. To address this gap, we established a most comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of off-the-shelf foundation models across six distinct clinical task types, encompassing a total of 39 specific tasks. Our findings reveal that existing foundation models excel at certain task types but struggle to effectively handle the full breadth of clinical tasks. To improve the generalization of pathology foundation models, we propose a unified knowledge distillation framework consisting of both expert and self knowledge distillation, where the former allows the model to learn from the knowledge of multiple expert models, while the latter leverages self-distillation to enable image representation learning via local-global alignment. Based on this framework, a Generalizable Pathology Foundation Model (GPFM) is pretrained on a large-scale dataset consisting of 190 million images from around 86,000 public H&E whole slides across 34 major tissue types. Evaluated on the established benchmark, GPFM achieves an impressive average rank of 1.36, with 29 tasks ranked 1st, while the the second-best model, UNI, attains an average rank of 2.96, with only 4 tasks ranked 1st. The superior generalization of GPFM demonstrates its exceptional modeling capabilities across a wide range of clinical tasks, positioning it as a new cornerstone for feature representation in CPath.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Importance of Downstream Networks in Digital Pathology Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17804v3)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital pathology has significantly advanced disease detection and pathologist efficiency through the analysis of gigapixel whole-slide images (WSI). In this process, WSIs are first divided into patches, for which a feature extractor model is applied to obtain feature vectors, which are subsequently processed by an aggregation model to predict the respective WSI label. With the rapid evolution of representation learning, numerous new feature extractor models, often termed foundational models, have emerged. Traditional evaluation methods rely on a static downstream aggregation model setup, encompassing a fixed architecture and hyperparameters, a practice we identify as potentially biasing the results. Our study uncovers a sensitivity of feature extractor models towards aggregation model configurations, indicating that performance comparability can be skewed based on the chosen configurations. By accounting for this sensitivity, we find that the performance of many current feature extractor models is notably similar. We support this insight by evaluating seven feature extractor models across three different datasets with 162 different aggregation model configurations. This comprehensive approach provides a more nuanced understanding of the feature extractors' sensitivity to various aggregation model configurations, leading to a fairer and more accurate assessment of new foundation models in digital pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Gaze Object Prediction via Pixel-level Supervision from Vision Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01044v1)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaze object prediction (GOP) aims to predict the category and location of the object that a human is looking at. Previous methods utilized box-level supervision to identify the object that a person is looking at, but struggled with semantic ambiguity, ie, a single box may contain several items since objects are close together. The Vision foundation model (VFM) has improved in object segmentation using box prompts, which can reduce confusion by more precisely locating objects, offering advantages for fine-grained prediction of gaze objects. This paper presents a more challenging gaze object segmentation (GOS) task, which involves inferring the pixel-level mask corresponding to the object captured by human gaze behavior. In particular, we propose that the pixel-level supervision provided by VFM can be integrated into gaze object prediction to mitigate semantic ambiguity. This leads to our gaze object detection and segmentation framework that enables accurate pixel-level predictions. Different from previous methods that require additional head input or ignore head features, we propose to automatically obtain head features from scene features to ensure the model's inference efficiency and flexibility in the real world. Moreover, rather than directly fuse features to predict gaze heatmap as in existing methods, which may overlook spatial location and subtle details of the object, we develop a space-to-object gaze regression method to facilitate human-object gaze interaction. Specifically, it first constructs an initial human-object spatial connection, then refines this connection by interacting with semantically clear features in the segmentation branch, ultimately predicting a gaze heatmap for precise localization. Extensive experiments on GOO-Synth and GOO-Real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | Accepted by ECCV2024 |

There is a wide variety of knowledge patterns embedded in the graph data, such as node properties and clusters, which are crucial to learning generalized representations for GFMs. However, existing surveys of GFMs have several shortcomings: they lack comprehensiveness regarding the most recent progress, have unclear categorization of self-supervised methods, and take a limited architecture-based perspective that is restricted to only certain types of graph models. As the ultimate goal of GFMs is to learn generalized graph knowledge, we provide a comprehensive survey of self-supervised GFMs from a novel knowledge-based perspective. We propose a knowledge-based taxonomy, which categorizes self-supervised graph models by the specific graph knowledge utilized. Our taxonomy consists of microscopic (nodes, links, etc.), mesoscopic (context, clusters, etc.), and macroscopic knowledge (global structure, manifolds, etc.). It covers a total of 9 knowledge categories and more than 25 pretext tasks for pre-training GFMs, as well as various downstream task generalization strategies. Such a knowledge-based taxonomy allows us to re-examine graph models based on new architectures more clearly, such as graph language models, as well as provide more in-depth insights for constructing GFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 7 figures; work in progress</p></details> |
| **[Universal Approximation Theory: Foundations for Parallelism in Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21670v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks are increasingly evolving towards training large models with big data, a method that has demonstrated superior performance across many tasks. However, this approach introduces an urgent problem: current deep learning models are predominantly serial, meaning that as the number of network layers increases, so do the training and inference times. This is unacceptable if deep learning is to continue advancing. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep learning parallelization strategy based on the Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT). From this foundation, we designed a parallel network called Para-Former to test our theory. Unlike traditional serial models, the inference time of Para-Former does not increase with the number of layers, significantly accelerating the inference speed of multi-layer networks. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of this network.</p></details> |  |
| **[A New Type of Foundation Model Based on Recordings of People's Emotions and Physiology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00030v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have had a big impact in recent years and billions of dollars are being invested in them in the current AI boom. The more popular ones, such as Chat-GPT, are trained on large amounts of data from the Internet, and then reinforcement learning, RAG, prompt engineering and cognitive modelling are used to fine-tune and augment their behavior. This technology has been used to create models of individual people, such as Caryn Marjorie. However, these chatbots are not based on people's actual emotional and physiological responses to their environment, so they are, at best, surface-level approximations to the characters they are imitating. This paper describes how a new type of foundation model - a first-person foundation model - could be created from recordings of what a person sees and hears as well as their emotional and physiological reactions to these stimuli. A first-person foundation model would map environmental stimuli to a person's emotional and physiological states, and map a person's emotional and physiological states to their behavior. First-person foundation models have many exciting applications, including a new type of recommendation engine, personal assistants, generative adversarial networks, dating and recruitment. To obtain training data for a first-person foundation model, we have developed a recording rig that captures what the wearer is seeing and hearing as well as their emotional and physiological states. This novel source of data could help to address the shortage of new data for building the next generation of foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

The advent of Whole Slide Scanners and the development of deep learning technologies have significantly advanced the field, leading to extensive research and development in pathology AI (Artificial Intelligence). These advancements have contributed to reducing the workload of pathologists and supporting decision-making in treatment plans. Recently, large-scale AI models known as Foundation Models (FMs), which are more accurate and applicable to a wide range of tasks compared to traditional AI, have emerged, and expanded their application scope in the healthcare field. Numerous FMs have been developed in pathology, and there are reported cases of their application in various tasks, such as disease diagnosis, rare cancer diagnosis, patient survival prognosis prediction, biomarker expression prediction, and the scoring of immunohistochemical expression intensity. However, several challenges remain for the clinical application of FMs, which healthcare professionals, as users, must be aware of. Research is ongoing to address these challenges. In the future, it is expected that the development of Generalist Medical AI, which integrates pathology FMs with FMs from other medical domains, will progress, leading to the effective utilization of AI in real clinical settings to promote precision and personalized medicine.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |

The integration of the two has garnered significant attention from the AI research community. In this work, we attempt to provide an in-depth and comprehensive evaluation of the performance of MFM s on embodied task planning, aiming to shed light on their capabilities and limitations in this domain. To this end, based on the characteristics of embodied task planning, we first develop a systematic evaluation framework, which encapsulates four crucial capabilities of MFMs: object understanding, spatio-temporal perception, task understanding, and embodied reasoning. Following this, we propose a new benchmark, named MFE-ETP, characterized its complex and variable task scenarios, typical yet diverse task types, task instances of varying difficulties, and rich test case types ranging from multiple embodied question answering to embodied task reasoning. Finally, we offer a simple and easy-to-use automatic evaluation platform that enables the automated testing of multiple MFMs on the proposed benchmark. Using the benchmark and evaluation platform, we evaluated several state-of-the-art MFMs and found that they significantly lag behind human-level performance. The MFE-ETP is a high-quality, large-scale, and challenging benchmark relevant to real-world tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Histopathology Foundation Models for Ovarian Cancer Bevacizumab Treatment Response Prediction from Whole Slide Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20596v1)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bevacizumab is a widely studied targeted therapeutic drug used in conjunction with standard chemotherapy for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer. While its administration has shown to increase the progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced stage ovarian cancer, the lack of identifiable biomarkers for predicting patient response has been a major roadblock in its effective adoption towards personalized medicine. In this work, we leverage the latest histopathology foundation models trained on large-scale whole slide image (WSI) datasets to extract ovarian tumor tissue features for predicting bevacizumab response from WSIs. Our extensive experiments across a combination of different histopathology foundation models and multiple instance learning (MIL) strategies demonstrate capability of these large models in predicting bevacizumab response in ovarian cancer patients with the best models achieving an AUC score of 0.86 and an accuracy score of 72.5%. Furthermore, our survival models are able to stratify high- and low-risk cases with statistical significance (p < 0.05) even among the patients with the aggressive subtype of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma. This work highlights the utility of histopathology foundation models for the task of ovarian bevacizumab response prediction from WSIs. The high-attention regions of the WSIs highlighted by these models not only aid the model explainability but also serve as promising imaging biomarkers for treatment prognosis.</p></details> |  |
| **[The GPT Dilemma: Foundation Models and the Shadow of Dual-Use](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20442v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines the dual-use challenges of foundation models and the consequent risks they pose for international security. As artificial intelligence (AI) models are increasingly tested and deployed across both civilian and military sectors, distinguishing between these uses becomes more complex, potentially leading to misunderstandings and unintended escalations among states. The broad capabilities of foundation models lower the cost of repurposing civilian models for military uses, making it difficult to discern another state's intentions behind developing and deploying these models. As military capabilities are increasingly augmented by AI, this discernment is crucial in evaluating the extent to which a state poses a military threat. Consequently, the ability to distinguish between military and civilian applications of these models is key to averting potential military escalations. The paper analyzes this issue through four critical factors in the development cycle of foundation models: model inputs, capabilities, system use cases, and system deployment. This framework helps elucidate the points at which ambiguity between civilian and military applications may arise, leading to potential misperceptions. Using the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty as a case study, this paper proposes several strategies to mitigate the associated risks. These include establishing red lines for military competition, enhancing information-sharing protocols, employing foundation models to promote international transparency, and imposing constraints on specific weapon platforms. By managing dual-use risks effectively, these strategies aim to minimize potential escalations and address the trade-offs accompanying increasingly general AI models.</p></details> |  |

Theia's rich visual representations encode diverse visual knowledge, enhancing downstream robot learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Theia outperforms its teacher models and prior robot learning models using less training data and smaller model sizes. Additionally, we quantify the quality of pre-trained visual representations and hypothesize that higher entropy in feature norm distributions leads to improved robot learning performance.

Inspired by this progress, we explore the potential of foundation models for time-series forecasting in smart agriculture, a field often plagued by limited data availability. Specifically, this work presents a novel application of $\texttt{TimeGPT}$, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) time-series foundation model, to predict soil water potential ($\psi_\mathrm{soil}$), a key indicator of field water status that is typically used for irrigation advice. Traditionally, this task relies on a wide array of input variables. We explore $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$'s ability to forecast $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ in: ($i$) a zero-shot setting, ($ii$) a fine-tuned setting relying solely on historic $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ measurements, and ($iii$) a fine-tuned setting where we also add exogenous variables to the model. We compare $\texttt{TimeGPT}$'s performance to established SOTA baseline models for forecasting $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$. Our results demonstrate that $\texttt{TimeGPT}$ achieves competitive forecasting accuracy using only historical $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ data, highlighting its remarkable potential for agricultural applications. This research paves the way for foundation time-series models for sustainable development in agriculture by enabling forecasting tasks that were traditionally reliant on extensive data collection and domain expertise.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, accepted at KDD '24 - Fragile Earth Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Boosting Graph Foundation Model from Structural Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19941v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph foundation models have recently attracted significant attention due to its strong generalizability. Although existing methods resort to language models to learn unified semantic representations across domains, they disregard the unique structural characteristics of graphs from different domains. To address the problem, in this paper, we boost graph foundation model from structural perspective and propose BooG. The model constructs virtual super nodes to unify structural characteristics of graph data from different domains. Specifically, the super nodes fuse the information of anchor nodes and class labels, where each anchor node captures the information of a node or a graph instance to be classified. Instead of using the raw graph structure, we connect super nodes to all nodes within their neighborhood by virtual edges. This new structure allows for effective information aggregation while unifying cross-domain structural characteristics. Additionally, we propose a novel pre-training objective based on contrastive learning, which learns more expressive representations for graph data and generalizes effectively to different domains and downstream tasks. Experimental results on various datasets and tasks demonstrate the superior performance of BooG. We provide our code and data here: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/BooG-EE42/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Foundation Models for Zero-Shot IoT Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19893v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models are increasingly deployed on edge Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, these models typically operate under supervised conditions and fail to recognize unseen classes different from training. To address this, zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to classify data of unseen classes with the help of semantic information. Foundation models (FMs) trained on web-scale data have shown impressive ZSL capability in natural language processing and visual understanding. However, leveraging FMs' generalized knowledge for zero-shot IoT sensing using signals such as mmWave, IMU, and Wi-Fi has not been fully investigated. In this work, we align the IoT data embeddings with the semantic embeddings generated by an FM's text encoder for zero-shot IoT sensing. To utilize the physics principles governing the generation of IoT sensor signals to derive more effective prompts for semantic embedding extraction, we propose to use cross-attention to combine a learnable soft prompt that is optimized automatically on training data and an auxiliary hard prompt that encodes domain knowledge of the IoT sensing task. To address the problem of IoT embeddings biasing to seen classes due to the lack of unseen class data during training, we propose using data augmentation to synthesize unseen class IoT data for fine-tuning the IoT feature extractor and embedding projector. We evaluate our approach on multiple IoT sensing tasks. Results show that our approach achieves superior open-set detection and generalized zero-shot learning performance compared with various baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/schrodingho/FM\_ZSL\_IoT.</p></details> |  |

Existing remote sensing foundation models make use of the various sources of spectral imagery to create large models pretrained on masked reconstruction task. The embeddings from these foundation models are then used for various downstream remote sensing applications. In this paper we propose a foundational modeling framework for remote sensing geoscience applications, that goes beyond these traditional single modality masked autoencoder family of foundation models. This framework leverages the knowledge guided principles that the spectral imagery captures the impact of the physical drivers on the environmental system, and that the relationship between them is governed by the characteristics of the system. Specifically, our method, called MultiModal Variable Step Forecasting (MM-VSF), uses mutlimodal data (spectral imagery and weather) as its input and a variable step forecasting task as its pretraining objective. In our evaluation we show forecasting of satellite imagery using weather can be used as an effective pretraining task for foundation models. We further show the effectiveness of the embeddings from MM-VSF on the downstream task of pixel wise crop mapping, when compared with a model trained in the traditional setting of single modality input and masked reconstruction based pretraining.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Also controversial is the application of AI to facial imaging data. This work explores the intersection of these two areas to understand two core questions: "Who" these algorithms are being unfair to and equally important "Why". Recent work has shown that deep AD can be unfair to different groups despite being unsupervised with a recent study showing that for portraits of people: men of color are far more likely to be chosen to be outliers. We study the two main categories of AD algorithms: autoencoder-based and single-class-based which effectively try to compress all the instances with those that can not be easily compressed being deemed to be outliers. We experimentally verify sources of unfairness such as the under-representation of a group (e.g. people of color are relatively rare), spurious group features (e.g. men are often photographed with hats), and group labeling noise (e.g. race is subjective). We conjecture that lack of compressibility is the main foundation and the others cause it but experimental results show otherwise and we present a natural hierarchy amongst them.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures, AAAI/ACM AIES24</p></details> |

| **[Improving Representation of High-frequency Components for Medical Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14651v2)** | 2024-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have recently attracted significant attention for their impressive generalizability across diverse downstream tasks. However, these models are demonstrated to exhibit great limitations in representing high-frequency components and fine-grained details. In many medical imaging tasks, the precise representation of such information is crucial due to the inherently intricate anatomical structures, sub-visual features, and complex boundaries involved. Consequently, the limited representation of prevalent foundation models can result in significant performance degradation or even failure in these tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel pretraining strategy, named Frequency-advanced Representation Autoencoder (Frepa). Through high-frequency masking and low-frequency perturbation combined with adversarial learning, Frepa encourages the encoder to effectively represent and preserve high-frequency components in the image embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an innovative histogram-equalized image masking strategy, extending the Masked Autoencoder approach beyond ViT to other architectures such as Swin Transformer and convolutional networks. We develop Frepa across nine medical modalities and validate it on 32 downstream tasks for both 2D images and 3D volume data. Without fine-tuning, Frepa can outperform other self-supervised pretraining methods and, in some cases, even surpasses task-specific trained models. This improvement is particularly significant for tasks involving fine-grained details, such as achieving up to a +15% increase in DSC for retina vessel segmentation and a +7% increase in IoU for lung nodule detection. Further experiments quantitatively reveal that Frepa enables superior high-frequency representations and preservation in the embeddings, underscoring its potential for developing more generalized and universal medical image foundation models.</p></details> |  |

However, such approaches cannot automatically integrate multiple complicated procedures to construct an intelligent agent, since each functionality is enabled by a separate model learned from independent climate datasets. The emergence of foundation models, especially multimodal foundation models, with their ability to process heterogeneous input data and execute complex tasks, offers a substantial opportunity to overcome this challenge. In this report, we want to explore a central question - how the state-of-the-art foundation model, i.e., GPT-4o, performs various atmospheric scientific tasks. Toward this end, we conduct a case study by categorizing the tasks into four main classes, including climate data processing, physical diagnosis, forecast and prediction, and adaptation and mitigation. For each task, we comprehensively evaluate the GPT-4o's performance along with a concrete discussion. We hope that this report may shed new light on future AI applications and research in atmospheric science.</p></details> | 28 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Feature Re-Embedding: Towards Foundation Model-Level Performance in Computational Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17228v4)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) is the most widely used framework in computational pathology, encompassing sub-typing, diagnosis, prognosis, and more. However, the existing MIL paradigm typically requires an offline instance feature extractor, such as a pre-trained ResNet or a foundation model. This approach lacks the capability for feature fine-tuning within the specific downstream tasks, limiting its adaptability and performance. To address this issue, we propose a Re-embedded Regional Transformer (R$^2$T) for re-embedding the instance features online, which captures fine-grained local features and establishes connections across different regions. Unlike existing works that focus on pre-training powerful feature extractor or designing sophisticated instance aggregator, R$^2$T is tailored to re-embed instance features online. It serves as a portable module that can seamlessly integrate into mainstream MIL models. Extensive experimental results on common computational pathology tasks validate that: 1) feature re-embedding improves the performance of MIL models based on ResNet-50 features to the level of foundation model features, and further enhances the performance of foundation model features; 2) the R$^2$T can introduce more significant performance improvements to various MIL models; 3) R$^2$T-MIL, as an R$^2$T-enhanced AB-MIL, outperforms other latest methods by a large margin.The code is available at: https://github.com/DearCaat/RRT-MIL.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2024 |

These methods excel in tasks such as property prediction and molecule generation by learning contextualized representations of input tokens through self-supervised learning on large unlabeled corpora. Typically, this involves pre-training on unlabeled data followed by fine-tuning on specific tasks, reducing dependence on annotated datasets and broadening chemical language representation understanding. This paper introduces a large encoder-decoder chemical foundation models pre-trained on a curated dataset of 91 million SMILES samples sourced from PubChem, which is equivalent to 4 billion of molecular tokens.

Our experiments across multiple benchmark datasets validate the capacity of the proposed model in providing state-of-the-art results for different tasks. We also provide a preliminary assessment of the compositionality of the embedding space as a prerequisite for the reasoning tasks.

Such research is expansive, ranging from the production of discriminatory, fake and toxic outputs, and privacy and copyright violations, to the unjust extraction of labor and natural resources. The same has not been the case in some of the most prominent AI governance initiatives in the global north like the UK's AI Safety Summit and the G7's Hiroshima process, which have influenced much of the international dialogue around AI governance. Despite the wealth of cautionary tales and evidence of algorithmic harm, there has been an ongoing over-emphasis within the AI governance discourse on technical matters of safety and global catastrophic or existential risks. This narrowed focus has tended to draw attention away from very pressing social and ethical challenges posed by the current brute-force industrialization of AI applications. To address such a visibility gap between real-world consequences and speculative risks, this paper offers a critical framework to account for the social, political, and environmental dimensions of foundation models and generative AI. We identify 14 categories of risks and harms and map them according to their individual, social, and biospheric impacts. We argue that this novel typology offers an integrative perspective to address the most urgent negative impacts of foundation models and their downstream applications. We conclude with recommendations on how this typology could be used to inform technical and normative interventions to advance responsible AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM C...</summary><p>ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT '24).

| **[AesExpert: Towards Multi-modality Foundation Model for Image Aesthetics Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09624v3)** | 2024-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The highly abstract nature of image aesthetics perception (IAP) poses significant challenge for current multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The lack of human-annotated multi-modality aesthetic data further exacerbates this dilemma, resulting in MLLMs falling short of aesthetics perception capabilities. To address the above challenge, we first introduce a comprehensively annotated Aesthetic Multi-Modality Instruction Tuning (AesMMIT) dataset, which serves as the footstone for building multi-modality aesthetics foundation models. Specifically, to align MLLMs with human aesthetics perception, we construct a corpus-rich aesthetic critique database with 21,904 diverse-sourced images and 88K human natural language feedbacks, which are collected via progressive questions, ranging from coarse-grained aesthetic grades to fine-grained aesthetic descriptions. To ensure that MLLMs can handle diverse queries, we further prompt GPT to refine the aesthetic critiques and assemble the large-scale aesthetic instruction tuning dataset, i.e. AesMMIT, which consists of 409K multi-typed instructions to activate stronger aesthetic capabilities. Based on the AesMMIT database, we fine-tune the open-sourced general foundation models, achieving multi-modality Aesthetic Expert models, dubbed AesExpert. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed AesExpert models deliver significantly better aesthetic perception performances than the state-of-the-art MLLMs, including the most advanced GPT-4V and Gemini-Pro-Vision.

Through a unified framework, PartGLEE accomplishes detection, segmentation, and grounding of instances at any granularity in the open world scenario. Specifically, we propose a Q-Former to construct the hierarchical relationship between objects and parts, parsing every object into corresponding semantic parts. By incorporating a large amount of object-level data, the hierarchical relationships can be extended, enabling PartGLEE to recognize a rich variety of parts. We conduct comprehensive studies to validate the effectiveness of our method, PartGLEE achieves the state-of-the-art performance across various part-level tasks and obtain competitive results on object-level tasks. The proposed PartGLEE significantly enhances hierarchical modeling capabilities and part-level perception over our previous GLEE model. Further analysis indicates that the hierarchical cognitive ability of PartGLEE is able to facilitate a detailed comprehension in images for mLLMs. The model and code will be released at https://provencestar.github.io/PartGLEE-Vision/ .</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV2024, homepage: https://provencestar.github.io/PartGLEE-Vision/</p></details> |

| **[Foundation Models for Autonomous Robots in Unstructured Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14296v2)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automating activities through robots in unstructured environments, such as construction sites, has been a long-standing desire. However, the high degree of unpredictable events in these settings has resulted in far less adoption compared to more structured settings, such as manufacturing, where robots can be hard-coded or trained on narrowly defined datasets. Recently, pretrained foundation models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), have demonstrated superior generalization capabilities by providing zero-shot solutions for problems do not present in the training data, proposing them as a potential solution for introducing robots to unstructured environments. To this end, this study investigates potential opportunities and challenges of pretrained foundation models from a multi-dimensional perspective. The study systematically reviews application of foundation models in two field of robotic and unstructured environment and then synthesized them with deliberative acting theory. Findings showed that linguistic capabilities of LLMs have been utilized more than other features for improving perception in human-robot interactions. On the other hand, findings showed that the use of LLMs demonstrated more applications in project management and safety in construction, and natural hazard detection in disaster management. Synthesizing these findings, we located the current state-of-the-art in this field on a five-level scale of automation, placing them at conditional automation. This assessment was then used to envision future scenarios, challenges, and solutions toward autonomous safe unstructured environments. Our study can be seen as a benchmark to track our progress toward that future.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2312.07843, arXiv:2402.05741 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[Computer Audition: From Task-Specific Machine Learning to Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15672v1)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) are increasingly spearheading recent advances on a variety of tasks that fall under the purview of computer audition -- the use of machines to understand sounds. They feature several advantages over traditional pipelines: among others, the ability to consolidate multiple tasks in a single model, the option to leverage knowledge from other modalities, and the readily-available interaction with human users. Naturally, these promises have created substantial excitement in the audio community, and have led to a wave of early attempts to build new, general-purpose foundation models for audio. In the present contribution, we give an overview of computational audio analysis as it transitions from traditional pipelines towards auditory foundation models. Our work highlights the key operating principles that underpin those models, and showcases how they can accommodate multiple tasks that the audio community previously tackled separately.</p></details> |  |

Human activity recognition in video has advanced with FMs, driven by competition among different architectures. However, high accuracies on standard benchmarks can draw an artificially rosy picture, as they often overlook real-world factors like changing camera perspectives. Popular benchmarks, mostly from YouTube or movies, offer diverse views but only coarse actions, which are insufficient for use-cases needing fine-grained, domain-specific actions. Domain-specific datasets (e.g., for industrial assembly) typically use data from limited static perspectives. This paper empirically evaluates how perspective changes affect different FMs in fine-grained human activity recognition. We compare multiple backbone architectures and design choices, including image- and video- based models, and various strategies for temporal information fusion, including commonly used score averaging and more novel attention-based temporal aggregation mechanisms. This is the first systematic study of different foundation models and specific design choices for human activity recognition from unknown views, conducted with the goal to provide guidance for backbone- and temporal- fusion scheme selection. Code and models will be made publicly available to the community.</p></details> |  |

However, these claims have not been thoroughly analyzed yet. Recently, foundation models have demonstrated unparalleled capabilities across diverse domains from language to computer vision, marking them as a potential cornerstone of future research for a multitude of computational tasks. In this paper, we conduct an extensive empirical study on representation learning for downstream Visual Question Answering (VQA), which requires an accurate compositional understanding of the scene. We thoroughly investigate the benefits and trade-offs of OC models and alternative approaches including large pre-trained foundation models on both synthetic and real-world data, and demonstrate a viable way to achieve the best of both worlds. The extensiveness of our study, encompassing over 800 downstream VQA models and 15 different types of upstream representations, also provides several additional insights that we believe will be of interest to the community at large.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empowering Embodied Visual Tracking with Visual Foundation Models and Offline RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09857v2)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embodied visual tracking is to follow a target object in dynamic 3D environments using an agent's egocentric vision. This is a vital and challenging skill for embodied agents. However, existing methods suffer from inefficient training and poor generalization. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that combines visual foundation models(VFM) and offline reinforcement learning(offline RL) to empower embodied visual tracking. We use a pre-trained VFM, such as "Tracking Anything", to extract semantic segmentation masks with text prompts. We then train a recurrent policy network with offline RL, e.g., Conservative Q-Learning, to learn from the collected demonstrations without online interactions. To further improve the robustness and generalization of the policy network, we also introduce a mask re-targeting mechanism and a multi-level data collection strategy. In this way, we can train a robust policy within an hour on a consumer-level GPU, e.g., Nvidia RTX 3090. We evaluate our agent on several high-fidelity environments with challenging situations, such as distraction and occlusion. The results show that our agent outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of sample efficiency, robustness to distractors, and generalization to unseen scenarios and targets. We also demonstrate the transferability of the learned agent from virtual environments to a real-world robot.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |

We introduce GPT-HyperAgent, an augmentation of GPT with HyperAgent for uncertainty-aware, scalable exploration in contextual bandits, a fundamental online decision problem involving natural language input. We prove that HyperAgent achieves fast incremental uncertainty estimation with $\tilde{O}(\log T)$ per-step computational complexity over $T$ periods under the linear realizable assumption. Our analysis demonstrates that HyperAgent's regret order matches that of exact Thompson sampling in linear contextual bandits, closing a significant theoretical gap in scalable exploration. Empirical results in real-world contextual bandit tasks, such as automated content moderation with human feedback, validate the practical effectiveness of GPT-HyperAgent for safety-critical decisions.

However, prior arts are seldom discussed under distribution shifts, which may be vulnerable in real-world applications. Recent Vision-Language Foundation Models, e.g., CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable performance in zero-shot out-of-distribution generalization, yet consuming heavy computation resources. In this paper, we discuss the extension of DFKD to Vision-Language Foundation Models without access to the billion-level image-text datasets. The objective is to customize a student model for distribution-agnostic downstream tasks with given category concepts, inheriting the out-of-distribution generalization capability from the pre-trained foundation models. In order to avoid generalization degradation, the primary challenge of this task lies in synthesizing diverse surrogate images driven by text prompts. Since not only category concepts but also style information are encoded in text prompts, we propose three novel Prompt Diversification methods to encourage image synthesis with diverse styles, namely Mix-Prompt, Random-Prompt, and Contrastive-Prompt. Experiments on out-of-distribution generalization datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, with Contrastive-Prompt performing the best.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM 2023</p></details> |

Conventional panoptic mapping methods, however, are limited by predefined semantic classes, thus making them ineffective for handling novel or unforeseen objects. In response to this limitation, we introduce the Unified Promptable Panoptic Mapping (UPPM) method. UPPM utilizes recent advances in foundation models to enable real-time, on-demand label generation using natural language prompts. By incorporating a dynamic labeling strategy into traditional panoptic mapping techniques, UPPM provides significant improvements in adaptability and versatility while maintaining high performance levels in map reconstruction. We demonstrate our approach on real-world and simulated datasets. Results show that UPPM can accurately reconstruct scenes and segment objects while generating rich semantic labels through natural language interactions. A series of ablation experiments validated the advantages of foundation model-based labeling over fixed label sets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under consideration at Pattern Recognition Letters</p></details> |

However, there has been limited work on integrating an additional, typically low-resource, language, while maintaining performance on the original language set. Fine-tuning, while simple, may degrade the accuracy of the original set. We compare three approaches that exploit adaptation parameters: soft language code tuning, train only the language code; soft prompt tuning, train prepended tokens; and LoRA where a small set of additional parameters are optimised. Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) offers an alternative compromise with the potential to maintain performance in specific target languages. Results show that direct fine-tuning yields the best performance for the new language but degrades existing language capabilities. EWC can address this issue for specific languages. If only adaptation parameters are used, the language capabilities are maintained but at the cost of performance in the new language.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods require pre-constructed 3D scenes and face scalability issues due to per-point feature vector learning, limiting their efficacy with complex queries. Our method overcomes these limitations by incrementally building instance-level 3D scene representations using 2D foundation models, efficiently aggregating instance-level details such as masks, feature vectors, names, and captions. We introduce fusion schemes for feature vectors to enhance their contextual knowledge and performance on complex queries. Additionally, we explore large language models for robust automatic annotation and spatial reasoning tasks. We evaluate our proposed approach on multiple scenes from ScanNet and Replica datasets demonstrating zero-shot generalization capabilities, exceeding current state-of-the-art methods in open world 3D scene understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://opensu3d.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[FoundPose: Unseen Object Pose Estimation with Foundation Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18809v2)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose FoundPose, a model-based method for 6D pose estimation of unseen objects from a single RGB image. The method can quickly onboard new objects using their 3D models without requiring any object- or task-specific training. In contrast, existing methods typically pre-train on large-scale, task-specific datasets in order to generalize to new objects and to bridge the image-to-model domain gap. We demonstrate that such generalization capabilities can be observed in a recent vision foundation model trained in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, our method estimates the object pose from image-to-model 2D-3D correspondences, which are established by matching patch descriptors from the recent DINOv2 model between the image and pre-rendered object templates. We find that reliable correspondences can be established by kNN matching of patch descriptors from an intermediate DINOv2 layer. Such descriptors carry stronger positional information than descriptors from the last layer, and we show their importance when semantic information is ambiguous due to object symmetries or a lack of texture. To avoid establishing correspondences against all object templates, we develop an efficient template retrieval approach that integrates the patch descriptors into the bag-of-words representation and can promptly propose a handful of similarly looking templates. Additionally, we apply featuremetric alignment to compensate for discrepancies in the 2D-3D correspondences caused by coarse patch sampling. The resulting method noticeably outperforms existing RGB methods for refinement-free pose estimation on the standard BOP benchmark with seven diverse datasets and can be seamlessly combined with an existing render-and-compare refinement method to achieve RGB-only state-of-the-art results.

| **[Semantic-CC: Boosting Remote Sensing Image Change Captioning via Foundational Knowledge and Semantic Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14032v1)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing image change captioning (RSICC) aims to articulate the changes in objects of interest within bi-temporal remote sensing images using natural language. Given the limitations of current RSICC methods in expressing general features across multi-temporal and spatial scenarios, and their deficiency in providing granular, robust, and precise change descriptions, we introduce a novel change captioning (CC) method based on the foundational knowledge and semantic guidance, which we term Semantic-CC. Semantic-CC alleviates the dependency of high-generalization algorithms on extensive annotations by harnessing the latent knowledge of foundation models, and it generates more comprehensive and accurate change descriptions guided by pixel-level semantics from change detection (CD). Specifically, we propose a bi-temporal SAM-based encoder for dual-image feature extraction; a multi-task semantic aggregation neck for facilitating information interaction between heterogeneous tasks; a straightforward multi-scale change detection decoder to provide pixel-level semantic guidance; and a change caption decoder based on the large language model (LLM) to generate change description sentences. Moreover, to ensure the stability of the joint training of CD and CC, we propose a three-stage training strategy that supervises different tasks at various stages. We validate the proposed method on the LEVIR-CC and LEVIR-CD datasets. The experimental results corroborate the complementarity of CD and CC, demonstrating that Semantic-CC can generate more accurate change descriptions and achieve optimal performance across both tasks.</p></details> |  |

These capabilities allow FMs to be adapted for various tasks, including biomedical reasoning, hypothesis generation, and clinical decision-making. This review paper examines the foundational components of an ethical and trustworthy AI (ETAI) biomedical ecosystem centered on FMs, highlighting key challenges and solutions. The ETAI biomedical ecosystem is defined by seven key components which collectively integrate FMs into clinical settings: Data Lifecycle Management, Data Processing, Model Development, Model Evaluation, Clinical Translation, AI Governance and Regulation, and Stakeholder Engagement. While the potential of biomedical AI is immense, it requires heightened ethical vigilance and responsibility. For instance, biases can arise from data, algorithms, and user interactions, necessitating techniques to assess and mitigate bias prior to, during, and after model development. Moreover, interpretability, explainability, and accountability are key to ensuring the trustworthiness of AI systems, while workflow transparency in training, testing, and evaluation is crucial for reproducibility. Safeguarding patient privacy and security involves addressing challenges in data access, cloud data privacy, patient re-identification, membership inference attacks, and data memorization. Additionally, AI governance and regulation are essential for ethical AI use in biomedicine, guided by global standards. Furthermore, stakeholder engagement is essential at every stage of the AI pipeline and lifecycle for clinical translation. By adhering to these principles, we can harness the transformative potential of AI and develop an ETAI ecosystem.</p></details> | 3 figures, 3 tables |

In this paper, we introduce a training-as-compressing perspective, wherein the model's weights embody a compressed representation of the training data. From a copyright standpoint, this point of view implies that the weights could be considered a reproduction or a derivative work of a potentially protected set of works. We investigate the technical and legal challenges that emerge from this framing of the copyright of outputs generated by foundation models, including their implications for practitioners and researchers.

That we work predicatively means that we do not assume Voevodsky's propositional resizing axioms. Our work is constructive in the sense that we do not rely on excluded middle or the axiom of (countable) choice. Domain theory studies so-called directed complete posets (dcpos) and Scott continuous maps between them and has applications in a variety of fields, such as programming language semantics, higher-type computability and topology. A common approach to deal with size issues in a predicative foundation is to work with information systems, abstract bases or formal topologies rather than dcpos, and approximable relations rather than Scott continuous functions. In our type-theoretic approach, we instead accept that dcpos may be large and work with type universes to account for this. A priori one might expect that iterative constructions of dcpos may result in a need for ever-increasing universes and are predicatively impossible. We show, through a careful tracking of type universe parameters, that such constructions can be carried out in a predicative setting. In particular, we give a predicative reconstruction of Scott's $D_\infty$ model of the untyped $\lambda$-calculus.

That we work predicatively means that we do not assume Voevodsky's propositional resizing axioms. Our work is constructive in the sense that we do not rely on excluded middle or the axiom of (countable) choice. To deal with size issues and give a predicatively suitable definition of continuity of a dcpo, we follow Johnstone and Joyal's work on continuous categories. Adhering to the univalent perspective, we explicitly distinguish between data and property. To ensure that being continuous is a property of a dcpo, we turn to the propositional truncation, although we explain that some care is needed to avoid needing the axiom of choice. We also adapt the notion of a domain-theoretic basis to the predicative setting by imposing suitable smallness conditions, analogous to the categorical concept of an accessible category. All our running examples of continuous dcpos are then actually examples of dcpos with small bases which we show to be well behaved predicatively. In particular, such dcpos are exactly those presented by small ideals. As an application of the theory, we show that Scott's $D_\infty$ model of the untyped $\lambda$-calculus is an example of an algebraic dcpo with a small basis. Our work is formalised in the Agda proof assistant and its ability to infer universe levels has been invaluable for our purposes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Based...</summary><p>Based on Ch. 4 of the author's PhD thesis (arXiv:2301.12405). v3: Updated Acknowledgements</p></details> |

However, these models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, posing significant risks to the reliability and safety of autonomous vehicles. Adversaries can exploit these vulnerabilities to manipulate the vehicle's perception of its surroundings, leading to erroneous decisions and potentially catastrophic consequences. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Precision-Guided Adversarial Attack (PG-Attack) framework that combines two techniques: Precision Mask Perturbation Attack (PMP-Attack) and Deceptive Text Patch Attack (DTP-Attack). PMP-Attack precisely targets the attack region to minimize the overall perturbation while maximizing its impact on the target object's representation in the model's feature space. DTP-Attack introduces deceptive text patches that disrupt the model's understanding of the scene, further enhancing the attack's effectiveness. Our experiments demonstrate that PG-Attack successfully deceives a variety of advanced multi-modal large models, including GPT-4V, Qwen-VL, and imp-V1.

In this paper, we present PointSeg, a novel training-free paradigm that leverages off-the-shelf vision foundation models to address 3D scene perception tasks. PointSeg can segment anything in 3D scene by acquiring accurate 3D prompts to align their corresponding pixels across frames. Concretely, we design a two-branch prompts learning structure to construct the 3D point-box prompts pairs, combining with the bidirectional matching strategy for accurate point and proposal prompts generation. Then, we perform the iterative post-refinement adaptively when cooperated with different vision foundation models. Moreover, we design a affinity-aware merging algorithm to improve the final ensemble masks. PointSeg demonstrates impressive segmentation performance across various datasets, all without training. Specifically, our approach significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art specialist training-free model by 14.1$\%$, 12.3$\%$, and 12.6$\%$ mAP on ScanNet, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 datasets, respectively. On top of that, PointSeg can incorporate with various foundation models and even surpasses the specialist training-based methods by 3.4$\%$-5.4$\%$ mAP across various datasets, serving as an effective generalist model.</p></details> |  |

Typically, speech is produced when air is forced from the lungs and is modulated by the vocal tract, where such actions are interspersed by moments of breathing in air (inhalation) to refill the lungs again. Respiratory rate (RR) is a vital metric that is used to assess the overall health, fitness, and general well-being of an individual. Existing approaches to measure RR (number of breaths one takes in a minute) are performed using specialized equipment or training. Studies have demonstrated that machine learning algorithms can be used to estimate RR using bio-sensor signals as input. Speech-based estimation of RR can offer an effective approach to measure the vital metric without requiring any specialized equipment or sensors. This work investigates a machine learning based approach to estimate RR from speech segments obtained from subjects speaking to a close-talking microphone device. Data were collected from N=26 individuals, where the groundtruth RR was obtained through commercial grade chest-belts and then manually corrected for any errors. A convolutional long-short term memory network (Conv-LSTM) is proposed to estimate respiration time-series data from the speech signal. We demonstrate that the use of pre-trained representations obtained from a foundation model, such as Wav2Vec2, can be used to estimate respiration-time-series with low root-mean-squared error and high correlation coefficient, when compared with the baseline. The model-driven time series can be used to estimate $RR$ with a low mean absolute error (MAE) ~ 1.6 breaths/min.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, BioKDD workshop paper</p></details> |
| **[The Foundation Model Transparency Index v1.1: May 2024](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12929v1)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are increasingly consequential yet extremely opaque. To characterize the status quo, the Foundation Model Transparency Index was launched in October 2023 to measure the transparency of leading foundation model developers. The October 2023 Index (v1.0) assessed 10 major foundation model developers (e.g. OpenAI, Google) on 100 transparency indicators (e.g. does the developer disclose the wages it pays for data labor?). At the time, developers publicly disclosed very limited information with the average score being 37 out of 100. To understand how the status quo has changed, we conduct a follow-up study (v1.1) after 6 months: we score 14 developers against the same 100 indicators. While in v1.0 we searched for publicly available information, in v1.1 developers submit reports on the 100 transparency indicators, potentially including information that was not previously public. We find that developers now score 58 out of 100 on average, a 21 point improvement over v1.0. Much of this increase is driven by developers disclosing information during the v1.1 process: on average, developers disclosed information related to 16.6 indicators that was not previously public. We observe regions of sustained (i.e. across v1.0 and v1.1) and systemic (i.e. across most or all developers) opacity such as on copyright status, data access, data labor, and downstream impact. We publish transparency reports for each developer that consolidate information disclosures: these reports are based on the information disclosed to us via developers. Our findings demonstrate that transparency can be improved in this nascent ecosystem, the Foundation Model Transparency Index likely contributes to these improvements, and policymakers should consider interventions in areas where transparency has not improved.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authored by the Center for Research on Foundation Models (CRFM) at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI).

We build a rigorous foundational framework for pMCMC algorithms that situates these methods within a unified 'extended phase space' measure-theoretic formalism. Drawing on our recent work that provides a comprehensive theory for reversible single proposal methods, we herein derive general criteria for multiproposal acceptance mechanisms which yield ergodic chains on general state spaces. Our formulation encompasses a variety of methodologies, including proposal cloud resampling and Hamiltonian methods, while providing a basis for the derivation of novel algorithms. In particular, we obtain a top-down picture for a class of methods arising from 'conditionally independent' proposal structures. As an immediate application, we identify several new algorithms including a multiproposal version of the popular preconditioned Crank-Nicolson (pCN) sampler suitable for high- and infinite-dimensional target measures which are absolutely continuous with respect to a Gaussian base measure. To supplement our theoretical results, we carry out a selection of numerical case studies that evaluate the efficacy of these novel algorithms. First, noting that the true potential of pMCMC algorithms arises from their natural parallelizability, we provide a limited parallelization study using TensorFlow and a graphics processing unit to scale pMCMC algorithms that leverage as many as 100k proposals at each step. Second, we use our multiproposal pCN algorithm (mpCN) to resolve a selection of problems in Bayesian statistical inversion for partial differential equations motivated by fluid measurement. These examples provide preliminary evidence of the efficacy of mpCN for high-dimensional target distributions featuring complex geometries and multimodal structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor revisions from previous version</p></details> |
| **[Muting Whisper: A Universal Acoustic Adversarial Attack on Speech Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06134v2)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in large speech foundation models like Whisper have led to their widespread use in many automatic speech recognition (ASR) applications. These systems incorporate `special tokens' in their vocabulary, such as $\texttt{<|endoftext|>}$, to guide their language generation process. However, we demonstrate that these tokens can be exploited by adversarial attacks to manipulate the model's behavior. We propose a simple yet effective method to learn a universal acoustic realization of Whisper's $\texttt{<|endoftext|>}$ token, which, when prepended to any speech signal, encourages the model to ignore the speech and only transcribe the special token, effectively `muting' the model. Our experiments demonstrate that the same, universal 0.64-second adversarial audio segment can successfully mute a target Whisper ASR model for over 97\% of speech samples. Moreover, we find that this universal adversarial audio segment often transfers to new datasets and tasks. Overall this work demonstrates the vulnerability of Whisper models to `muting' adversarial attacks, where such attacks can pose both risks and potential benefits in real-world settings: for example the attack can be used to bypass speech moderation systems, or conversely the attack can also be used to protect private speech data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Recipe Retrieval with Foundation Models: A Data Augmentation Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04763v2)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning recipe and food image representation in common embedding space is non-trivial but crucial for cross-modal recipe retrieval. In this paper, we propose a new perspective for this problem by utilizing foundation models for data augmentation. Leveraging on the remarkable capabilities of foundation models (i.e., Llama2 and SAM), we propose to augment recipe and food image by extracting alignable information related to the counterpart. Specifically, Llama2 is employed to generate a textual description from the recipe, aiming to capture the visual cues of a food image, and SAM is used to produce image segments that correspond to key ingredients in the recipe. To make full use of the augmented data, we introduce Data Augmented Retrieval framework (DAR) to enhance recipe and image representation learning for cross-modal retrieval. We first inject adapter layers to pre-trained CLIP model to reduce computation cost rather than fully fine-tuning all the parameters. In addition, multi-level circle loss is proposed to align the original and augmented data pairs, which assigns different penalties for positive and negative pairs. On the Recipe1M dataset, our DAR outperforms all existing methods by a large margin. Extensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component of DAR.</p></details> | ECCV2024 |
| **[MAGIC-VFM: Meta-learning Adaptation for Ground Interaction Control with Visual Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12304v1)** | 2024-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Control of off-road vehicles is challenging due to the complex dynamic interactions with the terrain. Accurate modeling of these interactions is important to optimize driving performance, but the relevant physical phenomena are too complex to model from first principles. Therefore, we present an offline meta-learning algorithm to construct a rapidly-tunable model of residual dynamics and disturbances. Our model processes terrain images into features using a visual foundation model (VFM), then maps these features and the vehicle state to an estimate of the current actuation matrix using a deep neural network (DNN). We then combine this model with composite adaptive control to modify the last layer of the DNN in real time, accounting for the remaining terrain interactions not captured during offline training. We provide mathematical guarantees of stability and robustness for our controller and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through simulations and hardware experiments with a tracked vehicle and a car-like robot. We evaluate our method outdoors on different slopes with varying slippage and actuator degradation disturbances, and compare against an adaptive controller that does not use the VFM terrain features. We show significant improvement over the baseline in both hardware experimentation and simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Foundations of Tokenization: Statistical and Computational Concerns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11606v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tokenization - the practice of converting strings of characters over an alphabet into sequences of tokens over a vocabulary - is a critical yet under-theorized step in the NLP pipeline. Notably, it remains the only major step not fully integrated into widely used end-to-end neural models. This paper aims to address this theoretical gap by laying the foundations of tokenization from a formal perspective. By articulating and extending basic properties about the category of stochastic maps, we propose a unified framework for representing and analyzing tokenizer models. This framework allows us to establish general conditions for the use of tokenizers. In particular, we formally establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for a tokenizer model to preserve the consistency of statistical estimators. Additionally, we discuss statistical and computational concerns crucial for the design and implementation of tokenizer models. The framework and results advanced in this paper represent a step toward a robust theoretical foundation for neural language modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Reference Architecture for Designing Foundation Model based Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11090v5)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The release of ChatGPT, Gemini, and other large language model has drawn huge interests on foundations models. There is a broad consensus that foundations models will be the fundamental building blocks for future AI systems. However, there is a lack of systematic guidance on the architecture design. Particularly, the the rapidly growing capabilities of foundations models can eventually absorb other components of AI systems, posing challenges of moving boundary and interface evolution in architecture design. Furthermore, incorporating foundations models into AI systems raises significant concerns about responsible and safe AI due to their opaque nature and rapidly advancing intelligence. To address these challenges, the paper first presents an architecture evolution of AI systems in the era of foundation models, transitioning from "foundation-model-as-a-connector" to "foundation-model-as-a-monolithic architecture". The paper then identifies key design decisions and proposes a pattern-oriented reference architecture for designing responsible foundation-model-based systems. The patterns can enable the potential of foundation models while ensuring associated risks.</p></details> |  |
| **[An efficient framework based on large foundation model for cervical cytopathology whole slide image screening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11486v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current cervical cytopathology whole slide image (WSI) screening primarily relies on detection-based approaches, which are limited in performance due to the expense and time-consuming annotation process. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), a weakly supervised approach that relies solely on bag-level labels, can effectively alleviate these challenges. Nonetheless, MIL commonly employs frozen pretrained models or self-supervised learning for feature extraction, which suffers from low efficacy or inefficiency. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for cervical cytopathology WSI classification using only WSI-level labels through unsupervised and weakly supervised learning. Given the sparse and dispersed nature of abnormal cells within cytopathological WSIs, we propose a strategy that leverages the pretrained foundation model to filter the top$k$ high-risk patches. Subsequently, we suggest parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of a large foundation model using contrastive learning on the filtered patches to enhance its representation ability for task-specific signals. By training only the added linear adapters, we enhance the learning of patch-level features with substantially reduced time and memory consumption. Experiments conducted on the CSD and FNAC 2019 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the performance of various MIL methods and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. The code and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/CVIU-CSU/TCT-InfoNCE.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Foundation Model for Brain Lesion Segmentation with Mixture of Modality Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10246v2)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain lesion segmentation plays an essential role in neurological research and diagnosis. As brain lesions can be caused by various pathological alterations, different types of brain lesions tend to manifest with different characteristics on different imaging modalities. Due to this complexity, brain lesion segmentation methods are often developed in a task-specific manner. A specific segmentation model is developed for a particular lesion type and imaging modality. However, the use of task-specific models requires predetermination of the lesion type and imaging modality, which complicates their deployment in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a universal foundation model for 3D brain lesion segmentation, which can automatically segment different types of brain lesions for input data of various imaging modalities. We formulate a novel Mixture of Modality Experts (MoME) framework with multiple expert networks attending to different imaging modalities. A hierarchical gating network combines the expert predictions and fosters expertise collaboration. Furthermore, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy during training to avoid the degeneration of each expert network and preserve their specialization. We evaluated the proposed method on nine brain lesion datasets, encompassing five imaging modalities and eight lesion types. The results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art universal models and provides promising generalization to unseen datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>The w...</summary><p>The work has been early accepted by MICCAI 2024</p></details> |

In this study, we utilize 283,582 unique, unlabeled TikTok video clips, categorized into 386 hashtags, to train a domain-specific foundation model for action recognition. We employ VideoMAE V2, an advanced model integrating Masked Autoencoders (MAE) with Vision Transformers (ViT), pre-trained on this diverse collection of unstructured videos. Our model, fine-tuned on established action recognition benchmarks such as UCF101 and HMDB51, achieves state-of-the-art results: 99.05% on UCF101, 86.08% on HMDB51, 85.51% on Kinetics-400, and 74.27% on Something-Something V2 using the ViT-giant backbone. These results highlight the potential of using unstructured and unlabeled videos as a valuable source of diverse and dynamic content for training foundation models. Our investigation confirms that while initial increases in pre-training data volume significantly enhance model performance, the gains diminish as the dataset size continues to expand. Our findings emphasize two critical axioms in self-supervised learning for computer vision: (1) additional pre-training data can yield diminishing benefits for some datasets and (2) quality is more important than quantity in self-supervised learning, especially when building foundation models.</p></details> | 10 pages |

In this study, we introduce OmniGenome, a foundation model that addresses this critical challenge of sequence-structure alignment in RNA FMs. OmniGenome bridges the sequences with secondary structures using structure-contextualized modeling, enabling hard in-silico genomic tasks that existing FMs cannot handle, e.g., RNA design tasks. The results on two comprehensive genomic benchmarks show that OmniGenome achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex RNA subtasks. For example, OmniGenome solved 74% of complex puzzles, compared to SpliceBERT which solved only 3% of the puzzles. Besides, OmniGenome solves most of the puzzles within $1$ hour, while the existing methods usually allocate $24$ hours for each puzzle. Overall, OmniGenome establishes wide genomic application cases and offers profound insights into biological mechanisms from the perspective of sequence-structure alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to NeurIPS 2024, 19 pages</p></details> |

To make progress towards better LLM autoraters, we introduce FLAMe, a family of Foundational Large Autorater Models. FLAMe is trained on our large and diverse collection of 100+ quality assessment tasks comprising 5M+ human judgments, curated and standardized using publicly released human evaluations from previous research. FLAMe significantly improves generalization to a wide variety of held-out tasks, outperforming LLMs trained on proprietary data like GPT-4 and Claude-3 on many tasks. We show that FLAMe can also serve as a powerful starting point for further downstream fine-tuning, using reward modeling evaluation as a case study (FLAMe-RM). Notably, on RewardBench, our FLAMe-RM-24B model (with an accuracy of 87.8%) is the top-performing generative model trained exclusively on permissively licensed data, outperforming both GPT-4-0125 (85.9%) and GPT-4o (84.7%). Additionally, we explore a more computationally efficient approach using a novel tail-patch fine-tuning strategy to optimize our FLAMe multitask mixture for reward modeling evaluation (FLAMe-Opt-RM), offering competitive RewardBench performance while requiring approximately 25x less training datapoints. Overall, our FLAMe variants outperform all popular proprietary LLM-as-a-Judge models we consider across 8 out of 12 autorater evaluation benchmarks, encompassing 53 quality assessment tasks, including RewardBench and LLM-AggreFact. Finally, our analysis reveals that FLAMe is significantly less biased than these LLM-as-a-Judge models on the CoBBLEr autorater bias benchmark, while effectively identifying high-quality responses for code generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

| **[Aligning Neuronal Coding of Dynamic Visual Scenes with Foundation Vision Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10737v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our brains represent the ever-changing environment with neurons in a highly dynamic fashion. The temporal features of visual pixels in dynamic natural scenes are entrapped in the neuronal responses of the retina. It is crucial to establish the intrinsic temporal relationship between visual pixels and neuronal responses. Recent foundation vision models have paved an advanced way of understanding image pixels. Yet, neuronal coding in the brain largely lacks a deep understanding of its alignment with pixels. Most previous studies employ static images or artificial videos derived from static images for emulating more real and complicated stimuli. Despite these simple scenarios effectively help to separate key factors influencing visual coding, complex temporal relationships receive no consideration. To decompose the temporal features of visual coding in natural scenes, here we propose Vi-ST, a spatiotemporal convolutional neural network fed with a self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) prior, aimed at unraveling the temporal-based encoding patterns of retinal neuronal populations. The model demonstrates robust predictive performance in generalization tests. Furthermore, through detailed ablation experiments, we demonstrate the significance of each temporal module. Furthermore, we introduce a visual coding evaluation metric designed to integrate temporal considerations and compare the impact of different numbers of neuronal populations on complementary coding. In conclusion, our proposed Vi-ST demonstrates a novel modeling framework for neuronal coding of dynamic visual scenes in the brain, effectively aligning our brain representation of video with neuronal activity.

Despite the predominant focus on pretraining pathological foundation models, how to adapt foundation models to downstream tasks is little explored. For downstream adaptation, we propose the existence of two domain gaps, i.e., the Foundation-Task Gap and the Task-Instance Gap. To mitigate these gaps, we introduce PathoTune, a framework designed to efficiently adapt pathological or even visual foundation models to pathology-specific tasks via multi-modal prompt tuning. The proposed framework leverages Task-specific Visual Prompts and Task-specific Textual Prompts to identify task-relevant features, along with Instance-specific Visual Prompts for encoding single pathological image features. Results across multiple datasets at both patch-level and WSI-level demonstrate its superior performance over single-modality prompt tuning approaches. Significantly, PathoTune facilitates the direct adaptation of natural visual foundation models to pathological tasks, drastically outperforming pathological foundation models with simple linear probing. The code is available at https://github.com/openmedlab/PathoDuet.</p></details> | MICCAI 2024 |

To further unleash the power of foundation models, we present FIND, a generalized interface for aligning foundation models' embeddings with unified image and dataset-level understanding spanning modality and granularity. As shown in the teaser figure, a lightweight transformer interface without tuning any foundation model weights is enough for segmentation, grounding, and retrieval in an interleaved manner. The proposed interface has the following favorable attributes: (1) Generalizable. It applies to various tasks spanning retrieval, segmentation, etc., under the same architecture and weights. (2) Interleavable. With the benefit of multi-task multi-modal training, the proposed interface creates an interleaved shared embedding space. (3) Extendable. The proposed interface is adaptive to new tasks, and new models. In light of the interleaved embedding space, we introduce FIND-Bench, which introduces new training and evaluation annotations to the COCO dataset for interleaved segmentation and retrieval. We are the first work aligning foundations models' embeddings for interleave understanding. Meanwhile, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on FIND-Bench and competitive performance on standard retrieval and segmentation settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>CODE:...</summary><p>CODE: https://github.com/UX-Decoder/FIND</p></details> |

Nevertheless, they demand tremendous training resources, and the training data is often inaccessible, e.g., CLIP, DINOv2, posing great challenges to developing derivatives that could advance research in this field. In this work, we offer a very simple and general solution, named Proteus, to distill foundation models into smaller equivalents on ImageNet-1K without access to the original training data. Specifically, we remove the designs from conventional knowledge distillation settings that result in dataset bias and present three levels of training objectives, i.e., token, patch, and feature, to maximize the efficacy of knowledge transfer. In this manner, Proteus is trained at ImageNet-level costs with surprising ability, facilitating the accessibility of training foundation models for the broader research community. Leveraging DINOv2-g/14 as the teacher, Proteus-L/14 matches the performance of the Oracle method DINOv2-L/14 (142M training data) across 15 benchmarks and outperforms other vision foundation models including CLIP-L/14 (400M), OpenCLIP-L/14 (400M/2B) and SynCLR-L/14 (600M).</p></details> |  |

For this to occur, humans internally estimate how hand movements affect the object's movement. We wish to endow robots with this capability. We contribute methodology to jointly estimate the geometry and pose of objects grasped by a robot, from RGB images captured by an external camera. Notably, our method transforms the estimated geometry into the robot's coordinate frame, while not requiring the extrinsic parameters of the external camera to be calibrated. Our approach leverages 3D foundation models, large models pre-trained on huge datasets for 3D vision tasks, to produce initial estimates of the in-hand object. These initial estimations do not have physically correct scales and are in the camera's frame. Then, we formulate, and efficiently solve, a coordinate-alignment problem to recover accurate scales, along with a transformation of the objects to the coordinate frame of the robot. Forward kinematics mappings can subsequently be defined from the manipulator's joint angles to specified points on the object. These mappings enable the estimation of points on the held object at arbitrary configurations, enabling robot motion to be designed with respect to coordinates on the grasped objects. We empirically evaluate our approach on a robot manipulator holding a diverse set of real-world objects.</p></details> |  |

Despite significant progress in object segmentation, part-level segmentation remains underexplored due to complex boundaries and scarce annotated data. To address this, we propose a novel Weakly-supervised Part Segmentation (WPS) setting and an approach called WPS-SAM, built on the large-scale pre-trained vision foundation model, Segment Anything Model (SAM). WPS-SAM is an end-to-end framework designed to extract prompt tokens directly from images and perform pixel-level segmentation of part regions. During its training phase, it only uses weakly supervised labels in the form of bounding boxes or points. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, through exploiting the rich knowledge embedded in pre-trained foundation models, WPS-SAM outperforms other segmentation models trained with pixel-level strong annotations. Specifically, WPS-SAM achieves 68.93% mIOU and 79.53% mACC on the PartImageNet dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art fully supervised methods by approximately 4% in terms of mIOU.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resource Management for Low-latency Cooperative Fine-tuning of Foundation Models at the Network Edge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09873v1)** | 2024-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of large-scale foundation models (FoMo's) that can perform human-like intelligence motivates their deployment at the network edge for devices to access state-of-the-art artificial intelligence. For better user experiences, the pre-trained FoMo's need to be adapted to specialized downstream tasks through fine-tuning techniques. To transcend a single device's memory and computation limitations, we advocate multi-device cooperation within the device-edge cooperative fine-tuning (DEFT) paradigm, where edge devices cooperate to simultaneously optimize different parts of fine-tuning parameters within a FoMo. However, the parameter blocks reside at different depths within a FoMo architecture, leading to varied computation latency-and-memory cost due to gradient backpropagation-based calculations. The heterogeneous on-device computation and memory capacities and channel conditions necessitate an integrated communication-and-computation allocation of local computation loads and communication resources to achieve low-latency (LoLa) DEFT. To this end, we consider the depth-ware DEFT block allocation problem. The involved optimal block-device matching is tackled by the proposed low-complexity Cutting-RecoUNting-CHecking (CRUNCH) algorithm, which is designed by exploiting the monotone-increasing property between block depth and computation latency-and-memory cost. Next, the joint bandwidth-and-block allocation makes the problem more sophisticated. We observe a splittable Lagrangian expression through the transformation and analysis of the original problem, where the variables indicating device involvement are introduced. Then, the dual ascent method is employed to tackle this problem iteratively. Through extensive experiments conducted on the GLUE benchmark, our results demonstrate significant latency reduction achievable by LoLa DEFT for fine-tuning a RoBERTa model.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

However, the lack of standardized guidelines for FM evaluation and comparison threatens the transparency of FM leaderboards and limits stakeholders' ability to perform effective FM selection. As a first step towards addressing this challenge, our research focuses on understanding how these FM leaderboards operate in real-world scenarios ("leaderboard operations") and identifying potential leaderboard pitfalls and areas for improvement ("leaderboard smells"). In this regard, we perform a multivocal literature review to collect up to 721 FM leaderboards, after which we examine their documentation and engage in direct communication with leaderboard operators to understand their workflow patterns. Using card sorting and negotiated agreement, we identify 5 unique workflow patterns and develop a domain model that outlines the essential components and their interaction within FM leaderboards. We then identify 8 unique types of leaderboard smells in LBOps. By mitigating these smells, SE teams can improve transparency, accountability, and collaboration in current LBOps practices, fostering a more robust and responsible ecosystem for FM comparison and selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>aweso...</summary><p>awesome foundation model leaderboard list: https://github.com/SAILResearch/awesome-foundation-model-leaderboards</p></details> |
| **[Debiased Noise Editing on Foundation Models for Fair Medical Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06104v4)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of Foundation Models' (FMs) rising prominence in AI, our study addresses the challenge of biases in medical images while the model operates in black-box (e.g., using FM API), particularly spurious correlations between pixels and sensitive attributes. Traditional methods for bias mitigation face limitations due to the restricted access to web-hosted FMs and difficulties in addressing the underlying bias encoded within the FM API. We propose a D(ebiased) N(oise) E(diting) strategy, termed DNE, which generates DNE noise to mask such spurious correlation. DNE is capable of mitigating bias both within the FM API embedding and the images themselves. Furthermore, DNE is suitable for both white-box and black-box FM APIs, where we introduced G(reedy) (Z)eroth-O(rder) (GeZO) optimization for it when the gradient is inaccessible in black-box APIs. Our whole pipeline enables fairness-aware image editing that can be applied across various medical contexts without requiring direct model manipulation or significant computational resources. Our empirical results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in maintaining fairness and utility across different patient groups and diseases. In the era of AI-driven medicine, this work contributes to making healthcare diagnostics more equitable, showcasing a practical solution for bias mitigation in pre-trained image FMs. Our code is provided at https://github.com/ubc-tea/DNE-foundation-model-fairness.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures.

| **[A Perspective on Foundation Models for the Electric Power Grid](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09434v1)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) currently dominate news headlines. They employ advanced deep learning architectures to extract structural information autonomously from vast datasets through self-supervision. The resulting rich representations of complex systems and dynamics can be applied to many downstream applications. Therefore, FMs can find uses in electric power grids, challenged by the energy transition and climate change. In this paper, we call for the development of, and state why we believe in, the potential of FMs for electric grids. We highlight their strengths and weaknesses amidst the challenges of a changing grid. We argue that an FM learning from diverse grid data and topologies could unlock transformative capabilities, pioneering a new approach in leveraging AI to redefine how we manage complexity and uncertainty in the electric grid. Finally, we discuss a power grid FM concept, namely GridFM, based on graph neural networks and show how different downstream tasks benefit.</p></details> | <details><summary>Lead ...</summary><p>Lead contact: H.F.H.; Major equal contributors: H.F.H., T.B., B.G., L.S.A.M., A.P., A.V., J.W.; Significant equal contributors: J.B., A.B.M., S.C., I.F., B.H., R.J., K.K., V.M., F.M., M.D.M., O.R., H.S., L.X., E.S.Y., A.Z.; Other equal contributors: A.J.B., R.J.B., B.P.B., J.S., S.S</p></details> |
| **[Inference Optimization of Foundation Models on AI Accelerators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09111v1)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Powerful foundation models, including large language models (LLMs), with Transformer architectures have ushered in a new era of Generative AI across various industries. Industry and research community have witnessed a large number of new applications, based on those foundation models. Such applications include question and answer, customer services, image and video generation, and code completions, among others. However, as the number of model parameters reaches to hundreds of billions, their deployment incurs prohibitive inference costs and high latency in real-world scenarios. As a result, the demand for cost-effective and fast inference using AI accelerators is ever more higher. To this end, our tutorial offers a comprehensive discussion on complementary inference optimization techniques using AI accelerators. Beginning with an overview of basic Transformer architectures and deep learning system frameworks, we deep dive into system optimization techniques for fast and memory-efficient attention computations and discuss how they can be implemented efficiently on AI accelerators. Next, we describe architectural elements that are key for fast transformer inference. Finally, we examine various model compression and fast decoding strategies in the same context.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tutor...</summary><p>Tutorial published at KDD 2024.

| **[Data Adaptive Traceback for Vision-Language Foundation Models in Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08787v1)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language foundation models have been incredibly successful in a wide range of downstream computer vision tasks using adaptation methods. However, due to the high cost of obtaining pre-training datasets, pairs with weak image-text correlation in the data exist in large numbers. We call them weak-paired samples. Due to the limitations of these weak-paired samples, the pre-training model are unable to mine all the knowledge from pre-training data. The existing adaptation methods do not consider the missing knowledge, which may lead to crucial task-related knowledge for the downstream tasks being ignored. To address this issue, we propose a new adaptation framework called Data Adaptive Traceback (DAT). Specifically, we utilize a zero-shot-based method to extract the most downstream task-related subset of the pre-training data to enable the downstream tasks. Furthermore, we adopt a pseudo-label-based semi-supervised technique to reuse the pre-training images and a vision-language contrastive learning method to address the confirmation bias issue in semi-supervised learning. We conduct extensive experiments that show our proposed DAT approach meaningfully improves various benchmark datasets performance over traditional adaptation methods by simply.</p></details> | 9 pages,4 figures |
| **[A Clinical Benchmark of Public Self-Supervised Pathology Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06508v3)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of self-supervised learning (SSL) to train pathology foundation models has increased substantially in the past few years. Notably, several models trained on large quantities of clinical data have been made publicly available in recent months. This will significantly enhance scientific research in computational pathology and help bridge the gap between research and clinical deployment. With the increase in availability of public foundation models of different sizes, trained using different algorithms on different datasets, it becomes important to establish a benchmark to compare the performance of such models on a variety of clinically relevant tasks spanning multiple organs and diseases. In this work, we present a collection of pathology datasets comprising clinical slides associated with clinically relevant endpoints including cancer diagnoses and a variety of biomarkers generated during standard hospital operation from two medical centers. We leverage these datasets to systematically assess the performance of public pathology foundation models and provide insights into best practices for training new foundation models and selecting appropriate pretrained models.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2310.07033</p></details> |
| **[Paving the way toward foundation models for irregular and unaligned Satellite Image Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08448v1)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although recently several foundation models for satellite remote sensing imagery have been proposed, they fail to address major challenges of real/operational applications. Indeed, embeddings that don't take into account the spectral, spatial and temporal dimensions of the data as well as the irregular or unaligned temporal sampling are of little use for most real world uses.As a consequence, we propose an ALIgned Sits Encoder (ALISE), a novel approach that leverages the spatial, spectral, and temporal dimensions of irregular and unaligned SITS while producing aligned latent representations. Unlike SSL models currently available for SITS, ALISE incorporates a flexible query mechanism to project the SITS into a common and learned temporal projection space. Additionally, thanks to a multi-view framework, we explore integration of instance discrimination along a masked autoencoding task to SITS. The quality of the produced representation is assessed through three downstream tasks: crop segmentation (PASTIS), land cover segmentation (MultiSenGE), and a novel crop change detection dataset. Furthermore, the change detection task is performed without supervision. The results suggest that the use of aligned representations is more effective than previous SSL methods for linear probing segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Masked Particle Modeling on Sets: Towards Self-Supervised High Energy Physics Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13537v3)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose masked particle modeling (MPM) as a self-supervised method for learning generic, transferable, and reusable representations on unordered sets of inputs for use in high energy physics (HEP) scientific data. This work provides a novel scheme to perform masked modeling based pre-training to learn permutation invariant functions on sets. More generally, this work provides a step towards building large foundation models for HEP that can be generically pre-trained with self-supervised learning and later fine-tuned for a variety of down-stream tasks. In MPM, particles in a set are masked and the training objective is to recover their identity, as defined by a discretized token representation of a pre-trained vector quantized variational autoencoder. We study the efficacy of the method in samples of high energy jets at collider physics experiments, including studies on the impact of discretization, permutation invariance, and ordering. We also study the fine-tuning capability of the model, showing that it can be adapted to tasks such as supervised and weakly supervised jet classification, and that the model can transfer efficiently with small fine-tuning data sets to new classes and new data domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation Model Engineering: Engineering Foundation Models Just as Engineering Software](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08176v1)** | 2024-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By treating data and models as the source code, Foundation Models (FMs) become a new type of software. Mirroring the concept of software crisis, the increasing complexity of FMs making FM crisis a tangible concern in the coming decade, appealing for new theories and methodologies from the field of software engineering. In this paper, we outline our vision of introducing Foundation Model (FM) engineering, a strategic response to the anticipated FM crisis with principled engineering methodologies. FM engineering aims to mitigate potential issues in FM development and application through the introduction of declarative, automated, and unified programming interfaces for both data and model management, reducing the complexities involved in working with FMs by providing a more structured and intuitive process for developers. Through the establishment of FM engineering, we aim to provide a robust, automated, and extensible framework that addresses the imminent challenges, and discovering new research opportunities for the software engineering field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2030 Software Engineering Workshop, co-located with FSE24; Invited to ACM TOSEM 2030 Roadmap for Software Engineering</p></details> |

In addition to characterizing how these models understand and reason with natural language, we also investigate how well they comprehend cultural practices, nuances, and values. Alongside standard accuracy metrics, we investigate the brittleness of foundation models in the dimensions of semantics and multilinguality. Our analyses span both open-sourced and closed models, leading to empirical results across classic NLP tasks, reasoning, and cultural comprehension. Key findings indicate (1) Most models exhibit varied behavior when given paraphrased instructions. (2) Many models still suffer from exposure bias (e.g., positional bias, majority label bias). (3) For questions rooted in factual, scientific, and commonsense knowledge, consistent responses are expected across multilingual queries that are semantically equivalent. Yet, most models surprisingly demonstrate inconsistent performance on these queries. (4) Multilingually-trained models have not attained "balanced multilingual" capabilities. Our endeavors underscore the need for more generalizable semantic representations and enhanced multilingual contextualization. SeaEval can serve as a launchpad for more thorough investigations and evaluations for multilingual and multicultural scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at NAACL 2024.

| **[Towards Interpretable Foundation Models of Robot Behavior: A Task Specific Policy Generation Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08065v1)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are a promising path toward general-purpose and user-friendly robots. The prevalent approach involves training a generalist policy that, like a reinforcement learning policy, uses observations to output actions. Although this approach has seen much success, several concerns arise when considering deployment and end-user interaction with these systems. In particular, the lack of modularity between tasks means that when model weights are updated (e.g., when a user provides feedback), the behavior in other, unrelated tasks may be affected. This can negatively impact the system's interpretability and usability. We present an alternative approach to the design of robot foundation models, Diffusion for Policy Parameters (DPP), which generates stand-alone, task-specific policies. Since these policies are detached from the foundation model, they are updated only when a user wants, either through feedback or personalization, allowing them to gain a high degree of familiarity with that policy. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept of DPP in simulation then discuss its limitations and the future of interpretable foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Short...</summary><p>Short Paper accepted to RLC 2024 Workshop on Training Agents with Foundation Models</p></details> |

However, their performance under domain shift is yet underexplored. This paper investigates the zero-shot domain adaptation potential of FMs by comparing different backbone architectures and introducing novel domain-aware components that leverage domain related textual embeddings. We propose domain adaptive normalization, termed as Domino, which explicitly leverages domain embeddings during fine-tuning, thus making the model domain aware. Ultimately, Domino enables more robust computer vision models that can adapt effectively to various unseen domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2024 Workshop on Foundation Models in the Wild</p></details> |
| **[Federated Foundation Model for Cardiac CT Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07557v1)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) is a renowned technique for utilizing decentralized data while preserving privacy. However, real-world applications often involve inherent challenges such as partially labeled datasets, where not all clients possess expert annotations of all labels of interest, leaving large portions of unlabeled data unused. In this study, we conduct the largest federated cardiac CT imaging analysis to date, focusing on partially labeled datasets ($n=8,124$) of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) patients over eight hospital clients. Transformer architectures, which are the major building blocks of current foundation models, have shown superior performance when trained on larger cohorts than traditional CNNs. However, when trained on small task-specific labeled sample sizes, it is currently not feasible to exploit their underlying attention mechanism for improved performance. Therefore, we developed a two-stage semi-supervised learning strategy that distills knowledge from several task-specific CNNs (landmark detection and segmentation of calcification) into a single transformer model by utilizing large amounts of unlabeled data typically residing unused in hospitals to mitigate these issues. This method not only improves the predictive accuracy and generalizability of transformer-based architectures but also facilitates the simultaneous learning of all partial labels within a single transformer model across the federation. Additionally, we show that our transformer-based model extracts more meaningful features for further downstream tasks than the UNet-based one by only training the last layer to also solve segmentation of coronary arteries. We make the code and weights of the final model openly available, which can serve as a foundation model for further research in cardiac CT imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViTime: A Visual Intelligence-Based Foundation Model for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07311v1)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of large pretrained models in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) has opened new avenues for constructing foundation models for time series forecasting (TSF). Traditional TSF foundation models rely heavily on numerical data fitting. In contrast, the human brain is inherently skilled at processing visual information, prefer predicting future trends by observing visualized sequences. From a biomimetic perspective, utilizing models to directly process numerical sequences might not be the most effective route to achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This paper proposes ViTime, a novel Visual Intelligence-based foundation model for TSF. ViTime overcomes the limitations of numerical time series data fitting by utilizing visual data processing paradigms and employs a innovative data synthesis method during training, called Real Time Series (RealTS). Experiments on a diverse set of previously unseen forecasting datasets demonstrate that ViTime achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, even surpassing the best individually trained supervised models in some situations. These findings suggest that visual intelligence can significantly enhance time series analysis and forecasting, paving the way for more advanced and versatile models in the field.

However, foundation models that can freely sense, interact, and actuate the physical world like in the digital domain is far from being realized. This is due to a number of challenges including: 1) being constrained to the types of static devices and sensors deployed, 2) events often being localized to one part of a large space, and 3) requiring dense and deployments of devices to achieve full coverage. As a critical step towards enabling foundation models to successfully and freely interact with the physical environment, we propose RASP, a modular and reconfigurable sensing and actuation platform that allows drones to autonomously swap onboard sensors and actuators in only $25$ seconds, allowing a single drone to quickly adapt to a diverse range of tasks. We demonstrate through real smart home deployments that RASP enables FMs and LLMs to complete diverse tasks up to $85\%$ more successfully by allowing them to target specific areas with specific sensors and actuators on-the-fly.</p></details> |  |
