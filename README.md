McKelvey and Tovey showed that the LP yolk provides a lower bound approximation for the size of the yolk and there has been considerable debate on whether the LP yolk is a good approximation of the yolk. In this paper, we show that for an odd number of voters in a two-dimensional space that the yolk radius is at most twice the size of the LP yolk radius. However, we also show that (1) even in this setting, the LP yolk center can be arbitrarily far away from the yolk center (relative to the radius of the yolk) and (2) for all other settings (an even number of voters or in dimension $k\geq 3$) that the LP yolk can be arbitrarily small relative to the yolk. Thus, in general, the LP yolk can be an arbitrarily poor approximation of the yolk.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing JEPAs with Spatial Conditioning: Robust and Efficient Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10773v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-based Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (IJEPA) offers an attractive alternative to Masked Autoencoder (MAE) for representation learning using the Masked Image Modeling framework. IJEPA drives representations to capture useful semantic information by predicting in latent rather than input space. However, IJEPA relies on carefully designed context and target windows to avoid representational collapse. The encoder modules in IJEPA cannot adaptively modulate the type of predicted and/or target features based on the feasibility of the masked prediction task as they are not given sufficient information of both context and targets. Based on the intuition that in natural images, information has a strong spatial bias with spatially local regions being highly predictive of one another compared to distant ones. We condition the target encoder and context encoder modules in IJEPA with positions of context and target windows respectively. Our "conditional" encoders show performance gains on several image classification benchmark datasets, improved robustness to context window size and sample-efficiency during pretraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Self-Supervised Learning - Theory and Practice.

| **[Fully Programmable Spatial Photonic Ising Machine by Focal Plane Division](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10689v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ising machines are an emerging class of hardware that promises ultrafast and energy-efficient solutions to NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. Spatial photonic Ising machines (SPIMs) exploit optical computing in free space to accelerate the computation, showcasing parallelism, scalability, and low power consumption. However, current SPIMs can implement only a restricted class of problems. This partial programmability is a critical limitation that hampers their benchmark. Achieving full programmability of the device while preserving its scalability is an open challenge. Here, we report a fully programmable SPIM achieved through a novel operation method based on the division of the focal plane. In our scheme, a general Ising problem is decomposed into a set of Mattis Hamiltonians, whose energies are simultaneously computed optically by measuring the intensity on different regions of the camera sensor. Exploiting this concept, we experimentally demonstrate the computation with high success probability of ground-state solutions of up to 32-spin Ising models on unweighted maximum cut graphs with and without ferromagnetic bias. Simulations of the hardware prove a favorable scaling of the accuracy with the number of spins. Our fully programmable SPIM enables the implementation of many quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems, further establishing SPIMs as a leading paradigm in non von Neumann hardware.</p></details> |  |
| **[Both Ears Wide Open: Towards Language-Driven Spatial Audio Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10676v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion models have achieved great success in mono-channel audio generation. However, when it comes to stereo audio generation, the soundscapes often have a complex scene of multiple objects and directions. Controlling stereo audio with spatial contexts remains challenging due to high data costs and unstable generative models. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first attempt to address these issues. We first construct a large-scale, simulation-based, and GPT-assisted dataset, BEWO-1M, with abundant soundscapes and descriptions even including moving and multiple sources. Beyond text modality, we have also acquired a set of images and rationally paired stereo audios through retrieval to advance multimodal generation. Existing audio generation models tend to generate rather random and indistinct spatial audio. To provide accurate guidance for latent diffusion models, we introduce the SpatialSonic model utilizing spatial-aware encoders and azimuth state matrices to reveal reasonable spatial guidance. By leveraging spatial guidance, our unified model not only achieves the objective of generating immersive and controllable spatial audio from text and image but also enables interactive audio generation during inference. Finally, under fair settings, we conduct subjective and objective evaluations on simulated and real-world data to compare our approach with prevailing methods. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its capability to generate spatial audio that adheres to physical rules.</p></details> |  |
| **[QueST: Querying Functional and Structural Niches on Spatial Transcriptomics Data via Contrastive Subgraph Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10652v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The functional or structural spatial regions within tissues, referred to as spatial niches, are elements for illustrating the spatial contexts of multicellular organisms. A key challenge is querying shared niches across diverse tissues, which is crucial for achieving a comprehensive understanding of the organization and phenotypes of cell populations. However, current data analysis methods predominantly focus on creating spatial-aware embeddings for cells, neglecting the development of niche-level representations for effective querying. To address this gap, we introduce QueST, a novel niche representation learning model designed for querying spatial niches across multiple samples. QueST utilizes a novel subgraph contrastive learning approach to explicitly capture niche-level characteristics and incorporates adversarial training to mitigate batch effects. We evaluate QueST on established benchmarks using human and mouse datasets, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art graph representation learning methods in accurate niche queries. Overall, QueST offers a specialized model for spatial niche queries, paving the way for deeper insights into the patterns and mechanisms of cell spatial organization across tissues.

| **[Statistical inference of partially linear time-varying coefficients spatial autoregressive panel data model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10647v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates a partially linear spatial autoregressive panel data model that incorporates fixed effects, constant and time-varying regression coefficients, and a time-varying spatial lag coefficient. A two-stage least squares estimation method based on profile local linear dummy variables (2SLS-PLLDV) is proposed to estimate both constant and time-varying coefficients without the need for first differencing. The asymptotic properties of the estimator are derived under certain conditions. Furthermore, a residual-based goodness-of-fit test is constructed for the model, and a residual-based bootstrap method is used to obtain p-values. Simulation studies show the good performance of the proposed method in various scenarios. The Chinese provincial carbon emission data set is analyzed for illustration.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 3 figures, codes</p></details> |
| **[Focal Surface Holographic Light Transport using Learned Spatially Adaptive Convolutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06854v2)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer-Generated Holography (CGH) is a set of algorithmic methods for identifying holograms that reconstruct Three-Dimensional (3D) scenes in holographic displays. CGH algorithms decompose 3D scenes into multiplanes at different depth levels and rely on simulations of light that propagated from a source plane to a targeted plane. Thus, for n planes, CGH typically optimizes holograms using n plane-to-plane light transport simulations, leading to major time and computational demands. Our work replaces multiple planes with a focal surface and introduces a learned light transport model that could propagate a light field from a source plane to the focal surface in a single inference. Our learned light transport model leverages spatially adaptive convolution to achieve depth-varying propagation demanded by targeted focal surfaces. The proposed model reduces the hologram optimization process up to 1.5x, which contributes to hologram dataset generation and the training of future learned CGH models.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH Asia 2024 Technical Communications</p></details> |
| **[Groningen: Spatial Prediction of Rock Gas Saturation by Leveraging Selected and Augmented Well and Seismic Data with Classifier Ensembles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10371v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a proof of concept for spatial prediction of rock saturation probability using classifier ensemble methods on the example of the giant Groningen gas field. The stages of generating 1481 seismic field attributes and selecting 63 significant attributes are described. The effectiveness of the proposed method of augmentation of well and seismic data is shown, which increased the training sample by 9 times. On a test sample of 42 wells (blind well test), the results demonstrate good accuracy in predicting the ensemble of classifiers: the Matthews correlation coefficient is 0.7689, and the F1-score for the "gas reservoir" class is 0.7949. Prediction of gas reservoir thicknesses within the field and adjacent areas is made.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Spatial-Aware Efficient Projector for MLLMs via Multi-Layer Feature Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10319v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The projector plays a crucial role in multi-modal language models (MLLMs). The number of visual tokens it outputs affects the efficiency of the MLLM, while the quality of the visual tokens influences the visual understanding capabilities of the MLLM. Current explorations on the projector focus on reducing the number of visual tokens to improve efficiency, often overlooking the inherent spatial discrepancy between the serialized 2-dimensional visual token sequences and natural language token sequences. A Spatial-Aware Efficient Projector (SAEP) is proposed to address this issue. In detail, our SAEP method employs an modified separable depthwise convolution module on multi-layer visual features to enhance the spatial information of visual tokens. As a result, our SAEP method can not only largely reduce the number of visual tokens by 75\%, but also significantly improve the multimodal spatial understanding capability of MLLMs. Moreover, compared to existing projectors, our SAEP gets best performances on massive multimodal evaluation benchmarks, which denotes its effectiveness on bridging the modality gap.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[YOLOCS: Object Detection based on Dense Channel Compression for Feature Spatial Solidification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04170v6)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we examine the associations between channel features and convolutional kernels during the processes of feature purification and gradient backpropagation, with a focus on the forward and backward propagation within the network. Consequently, we propose a method called Dense Channel Compression for Feature Spatial Solidification. Drawing upon the central concept of this method, we introduce two innovative modules for backbone and head networks: the Dense Channel Compression for Feature Spatial Solidification Structure (DCFS) and the Asymmetric Multi-Level Compression Decoupled Head (ADH). When integrated into the YOLOv5 model, these two modules demonstrate exceptional performance, resulting in a modified model referred to as YOLOCS. Evaluated on the MSCOCO dataset, the large, medium, and small YOLOCS models yield AP of 50.1%, 47.6%, and 42.5%, respectively. Maintaining inference speeds remarkably similar to those of the YOLOv5 model, the large, medium, and small YOLOCS models surpass the YOLOv5 model's AP by 1.1%, 2.3%, and 5.2%, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incorporating Asymmetric Loss for Real Estate Prediction with Area-level Spatial Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09673v1)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate two asymmetric loss functions, namely LINEX loss and power divergence loss for optimal spatial prediction with area-level data. With our motivation arising from the real estate industry, namely in real estate valuation, we use the Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) for county-level values to show the change in prediction when the loss is different (asymmetric) from a traditional squared error loss (symmetric) function. Additionally, we discuss the importance of choosing the asymmetry parameter, and propose a solution to this choice for a general asymmetric loss function. Since the focus is on area-level data predictions, we propose the methodology in the context of conditionally autoregressive (CAR) models. We conclude that choice of the loss functions for spatial area-level predictions can play a crucial role, and is heavily driven by the choice of parameters in the respective loss.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Expeditious Spatial Mean Radiant Temperature Mapping Framework using Visual SLAM and Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09443v1)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring thermal comfort is essential for the well-being and productivity of individuals in built environments. Of the various thermal comfort indicators, the mean radiant temperature (MRT) is very challenging to measure. Most common measurement methodologies are time-consuming and not user-friendly. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel MRT measurement framework that uses visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and semantic segmentation techniques. The proposed approach follows the rule of thumb of the traditional MRT calculation method using surface temperature and view factors. However, it employs visual SLAM and creates a 3D thermal point cloud with enriched surface temperature information. The framework then implements Grounded SAM, a new object detection and segmentation tool to extract features with distinct temperature profiles on building surfaces. The detailed segmentation of thermal features not only reduces potential errors in the calculation of the MRT but also provides an efficient reconstruction of the spatial MRT distribution in the indoor environment. We also validate the calculation results with the reference measurement methodology. This data-driven framework offers faster and more efficient MRT measurements and spatial mapping than conventional methods. It can enable the direct engagement of researchers and practitioners in MRT measurements and contribute to research on thermal comfort and radiant cooling and heating systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2024 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Fusion Matrix Prompt Enhanced Self-Attention Spatial-Temporal Interactive Traffic Forecasting Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09356v1)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, spatial-temporal forecasting technology has been rapidly developed due to the increasing demand for traffic management and travel planning. However, existing traffic forecasting models still face the following limitations. On one hand, most previous studies either focus too much on real-world geographic information, neglecting the potential traffic correlation between different regions, or overlook geographical position and only model the traffic flow relationship. On the other hand, the importance of different time slices is ignored in time modeling. Therefore, we propose a Fusion Matrix Prompt Enhanced Self-Attention Spatial-Temporal Interactive Traffic Forecasting Framework (FMPESTF), which is composed of spatial and temporal modules for down-sampling traffic data. The network is designed to establish a traffic fusion matrix considering spatial-temporal heterogeneity as a query to reconstruct a data-driven dynamic traffic data structure, which accurately reveal the flow relationship of nodes in the traffic network. In addition, we introduce attention mechanism in time modeling, and design hierarchical spatial-temporal interactive learning to help the model adapt to various traffic scenarios. Through extensive experimental on six real-world traffic datasets, our method is significantly superior to other baseline models, demonstrating its efficiency and accuracy in dealing with traffic forecasting problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>THE W...</summary><p>THE WEB CONFERENCE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Measurement Error Correction for Spatially Defined Environmental Exposures in Survival Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09278v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Environmental exposures are often defined using buffer zones around geocoded home addresses, but these static boundaries can miss dynamic daily activity patterns, leading to biased results. This paper presents a novel measurement error correction method for spatially defined environmental exposures within a survival analysis framework using the Cox proportional hazards model. The method corrects high-dimensional surrogate exposures from geocoded residential data at multiple buffer radii by applying principal component analysis for dimension reduction and leveraging external GPS-tracked validation datasets containing true exposure measurements. It also derives the asymptotic properties and variances of the proposed estimators. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed estimators, demonstrating its ability to improve accuracy in estimated exposure effects. An illustrative application assesses the impact of greenness exposure on depression incidence in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS). The results demonstrate that correcting for measurement error significantly enhances the accuracy of exposure estimates. This method offers a critical advancement for accurately assessing the health impacts of environmental exposures, outperforming traditional static buffer approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-driven Characterization of Near-Surface Velocity in the San Francisco Bay Area: A Stationary and Spatially Varying Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18856v2)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents the development of two new sedimentary velocity models for the San Francisco Bay Area (SFBA) to improve the near-surface representation of shear-wave velocity ($V_S$) for large-scale, broadband numerical simulations, with the ultimate goal of enhancing the representation of the sedimentary layers in the Bay Area community velocity model. The first velocity model is stationary and is based solely on $V_{S30}$; the second velocity model is spatially varying and has location-specific adjustments. They were developed using a dataset of 200 measured $V_S$ profiles. Both models were formulated within a hierarchical Bayesian framework, using a parameterization that ensures robust scaling. The spatially varying model includes a slope adjustment term modeled as a Gaussian process to capture site-specific effects based on location. Residual analysis shows that both models are unbiased for $V_S$ values up to 1000 m/sec. Along-depth variability models were also developed using within-profile residuals. The proposed models show higher $V_S$ in the San Jose area and Livermore Valley compared to the USGS Bay Area community velocity model by a factor of two or more in some cases. Goodness-of-fit (GOF) comparisons using one-dimensional linear site-response analysis at selected sites demonstrate that the proposed models outperform the USGS model in capturing near-surface amplification across a broad frequency range. Incorporating along-depth variability further improves the GOF scores by reducing over-amplification at high frequencies. These results underscore the importance of integrating data-driven models of the shallow crust, like the ones presented here, in coarser regional community velocity models to enhance regional seismic hazard assessments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript: 18 pages, 12 figures.

| **[Dynamic Benchmarks: Spatial and Temporal Alignment for ADS Performance Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08903v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deployed SAE level 4+ Automated Driving Systems (ADS) without a human driver are currently operational ride-hailing fleets on surface streets in the United States. This current use case and future applications of this technology will determine where and when the fleets operate, potentially resulting in a divergence from the distribution of driving of some human benchmark population within a given locality. Existing benchmarks for evaluating ADS performance have only done county-level geographical matching of the ADS and benchmark driving exposure in crash rates. This study presents a novel methodology for constructing dynamic human benchmarks that adjust for spatial and temporal variations in driving distribution between an ADS and the overall human driven fleet. Dynamic benchmarks were generated using human police-reported crash data, human vehicle miles traveled (VMT) data, and over 20 million miles of Waymo's rider-only (RO) operational data accumulated across three US counties. The spatial adjustment revealed significant differences across various severity levels in adjusted crash rates compared to unadjusted benchmarks with these differences ranging from 10% to 47% higher in San Francisco, 12% to 20% higher in Maricopa, and 7% lower to 34% higher in Los Angeles counties. The time-of-day adjustment in San Francisco, limited to this region due to data availability, resulted in adjusted crash rates 2% lower to 16% higher than unadjusted rates, depending on severity level. The findings underscore the importance of adjusting for spatial and temporal confounders in benchmarking analysis, which ultimately contributes to a more equitable benchmark for ADS performance evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Spatial Bimanual Action Models Based on Affordance Regions and Human Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08848v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a novel approach for learning bimanual manipulation actions from human demonstration by extracting spatial constraints between affordance regions, termed affordance constraints, of the objects involved. Affordance regions are defined as object parts that provide interaction possibilities to an agent. For example, the bottom of a bottle affords the object to be placed on a surface, while its spout affords the contained liquid to be poured. We propose a novel approach to learn changes of affordance constraints in human demonstration to construct spatial bimanual action models representing object interactions. To exploit the information encoded in these spatial bimanual action models, we formulate an optimization problem to determine optimal object configurations across multiple execution keypoints while taking into account the initial scene, the learned affordance constraints, and the robot's kinematics. We evaluate the approach in simulation with two example tasks (pouring drinks and rolling dough) and compare three different definitions of affordance constraints: (i) component-wise distances between affordance regions in Cartesian space, (ii) component-wise distances between affordance regions in cylindrical space, and (iii) degrees of satisfaction of manually defined symbolic spatial affordance constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, accepted for publication at Humanoids 2024 - This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

| **[SPA: 3D Spatial-Awareness Enables Effective Embodied Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08208v2)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce SPA, a novel representation learning framework that emphasizes the importance of 3D spatial awareness in embodied AI. Our approach leverages differentiable neural rendering on multi-view images to endow a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) with intrinsic spatial understanding. We present the most comprehensive evaluation of embodied representation learning to date, covering 268 tasks across 8 simulators with diverse policies in both single-task and language-conditioned multi-task scenarios. The results are compelling: SPA consistently outperforms more than 10 state-of-the-art representation methods, including those specifically designed for embodied AI, vision-centric tasks, and multi-modal applications, while using less training data. Furthermore, we conduct a series of real-world experiments to confirm its effectiveness in practical scenarios. These results highlight the critical role of 3D spatial awareness for embodied representation learning. Our strongest model takes more than 6000 GPU hours to train and we are committed to open-sourcing all code and model weights to foster future research in embodied representation learning.

| **[HorGait: Advancing Gait Recognition with Efficient High-Order Spatial Interactions in LiDAR Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08454v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gait recognition is a remote biometric technology that utilizes the dynamic characteristics of human movement to identify individuals even under various extreme lighting conditions. Due to the limitation in spatial perception capability inherent in 2D gait representations, LiDAR can directly capture 3D gait features and represent them as point clouds, reducing environmental and lighting interference in recognition while significantly advancing privacy protection. For complex 3D representations, shallow networks fail to achieve accurate recognition, making vision Transformers the foremost prevalent method. However, the prevalence of dumb patches has limited the widespread use of Transformer architecture in gait recognition. This paper proposes a method named HorGait, which utilizes a hybrid model with a Transformer architecture for gait recognition on the planar projection of 3D point clouds from LiDAR. Specifically, it employs a hybrid model structure called LHM Block to achieve input adaptation, long-range, and high-order spatial interaction of the Transformer architecture. Additionally, it uses large convolutional kernel CNNs to segment the input representation, replacing attention windows to reduce dumb patches. We conducted extensive experiments, and the results show that HorGait achieves state-of-the-art performance among Transformer architecture methods on the SUSTech1K dataset, verifying that the hybrid model can complete the full Transformer process and perform better in point cloud planar projection. The outstanding performance of HorGait offers new insights for the future application of the Transformer architecture in gait recognition.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we investigated the spread of synthetic opioids between 2013 and 2020 in the U.S. We analyzed the relationship between the spatiotemporal pattern of synthetic opioid-involved deaths and another key opioid, heroin, and compared patterns of deaths involving these two types of drugs during this period.

| **[Optimized Spatial Architecture Mapping Flow for Transformer Accelerators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07407v1)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent innovations in Transformer-based large language models have significantly advanced the field of general-purpose neural language understanding and generation. With billions of trainable parameters, deployment of these large models relies on high-performance hardware accelerators to efficiently deliver the required computation. Spatial architectures, such as TPUs, offer a promising solution to accelerating computation-intensive workloads. However, the design process for existing spatial architectures is predominantly manual, and it often involves time-consuming redesigns for new applications and new problem dimensions, which greatly limits the development of optimally designed accelerators for Transformer models. To address these challenges, we propose SAMT (Spatial Architecture Mapping for Transformers), a comprehensive framework designed to optimize the dataflow mapping of Transformer inference workloads onto spatial accelerators. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SAMT in improving the performance of spatial accelerators for Transformer models. We propose and leverage the dynamic operator fusion schemes for the Transformer models and co-search the optimal dataflow mapping strategies for spatial accelerators. SAMT significantly reduces inference latency by 12% to 91% and energy consumption by 3% to 23% for evaluated Transformer models compared to traditional spatial accelerator designs among edge, mobile and cloud settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structured Spatial Reasoning with Open Vocabulary Object Detectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07394v1)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning about spatial relationships between objects is essential for many real-world robotic tasks, such as fetch-and-delivery, object rearrangement, and object search. The ability to detect and disambiguate different objects and identify their location is key to successful completion of these tasks. Several recent works have used powerful Vision and Language Models (VLMs) to unlock this capability in robotic agents. In this paper we introduce a structured probabilistic approach that integrates rich 3D geometric features with state-of-the-art open-vocabulary object detectors to enhance spatial reasoning for robotic perception. The approach is evaluated and compared against zero-shot performance of the state-of-the-art Vision and Language Models (VLMs) on spatial reasoning tasks. To enable this comparison, we annotate spatial clauses in real-world RGB-D Active Vision Dataset [1] and conduct experiments on this and the synthetic Semantic Abstraction [2] dataset. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing superior performance of grounding spatial relations over state of the art open-source VLMs by more than 20%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Origin-Destination Matrices in Neural Spatial Interaction Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07352v1)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agent-based models (ABMs) are proliferating as decision-making tools across policy areas in transportation, economics, and epidemiology. In these models, a central object of interest is the discrete origin-destination matrix which captures spatial interactions and agent trip counts between locations. Existing approaches resort to continuous approximations of this matrix and subsequent ad-hoc discretisations in order to perform ABM simulation and calibration. This impedes conditioning on partially observed summary statistics, fails to explore the multimodal matrix distribution over a discrete combinatorial support, and incurs discretisation errors. To address these challenges, we introduce a computationally efficient framework that scales linearly with the number of origin-destination pairs, operates directly on the discrete combinatorial space, and learns the agents' trip intensity through a neural differential equation that embeds spatial interactions. Our approach outperforms the prior art in terms of reconstruction error and ground truth matrix coverage, at a fraction of the computational cost. We demonstrate these benefits in large-scale spatial mobility ABMs in Cambridge, UK and Washington, DC, USA.</p></details> |  |

LF images inherently possess rich spatial and angular information. Nonetheless, there is a scarcity of DA methodologies explicitly tailored for LF images, and existing works tend to concentrate solely on either the spatial or angular domain. This paper proposes a novel spatial and angular DA strategy named MaskBlur for LF image SR by concurrently addressing spatial and angular aspects. MaskBlur consists of spatial blur and angular dropout two components. Spatial blur is governed by a spatial mask, which controls where pixels are blurred, i.e., pasting pixels between the low-resolution and high-resolution domains. The angular mask is responsible for angular dropout, i.e., selecting which views to perform the spatial blur operation. By doing so, MaskBlur enables the model to treat pixels differently in the spatial and angular domains when super-resolving LF images rather than blindly treating all pixels equally. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of MaskBlur in significantly enhancing the performance of existing SR methods. We further extend MaskBlur to other LF image tasks such as denoising, deblurring, low-light enhancement, and real-world SR.

We present SPACE, a benchmark that systematically evaluates spatial cognition in frontier models. Our benchmark builds on decades of research in cognitive science. It evaluates large-scale mapping abilities that are brought to bear when an organism traverses physical environments, smaller-scale reasoning about object shapes and layouts, and cognitive infrastructure such as spatial attention and memory. For many tasks, we instantiate parallel presentations via text and images, allowing us to benchmark both large language models and large multimodal models. Results suggest that contemporary frontier models fall short of the spatial intelligence of animals, performing near chance level on a number of classic tests of animal cognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Hyperspheric Models for Compositional Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03648v2)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compositional data are an increasingly prevalent data source in spatial statistics. Analysis of such data is typically done on log-ratio transformations or via Dirichlet regression. However, these approaches often make unnecessarily strong assumptions (e.g., strictly positive components, exclusively negative correlations). An alternative approach uses square-root transformed compositions and directional distributions. Such distributions naturally allow for zero-valued components and positive correlations, yet they may include support outside the non-negative orthant and are not generative for compositional data. To overcome this challenge, we truncate the elliptically symmetric angular Gaussian (ESAG) distribution to the non-negative orthant. Additionally, we propose a spatial hyperspheric regression that contains fixed and random multivariate spatial effects. The proposed method also contains a term that can be used to propagate uncertainty that may arise from precursory stochastic models (i.e., machine learning classification). We demonstrate our method on a simulation study and on classified bioacoustic signals of the Dryobates pubescens (downy woodpecker).</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 5 figures, 4 appendices</p></details> |
| **[A physics-based perspective for understanding and utilizing spatial resources of wireless channels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06115v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To satisfy the increasing demands for transmission rates of wireless communications, it is necessary to use spatial resources of electromagnetic (EM) waves. In this context, EM information theory (EIT) has become a hot topic by integrating the theoretical framework of deterministic mathematics and stochastic statistics to explore the transmission mechanisms of continuous EM waves. However, the previous studies were primarily focused on frame analysis, with limited exploration of practical applications and a comprehensive understanding of its essential physical characteristics. In this paper, we present a three-dimensional (3-D) line-of-sight channel capacity formula that captures the vector EM physics and accommodates both near- and far-field scenes. Based on the rigorous mathematical equation and the physical mechanism of fast multipole expansion, a channel model is established, and the finite angular spectral bandwidth feature of scattered waves is revealed. To adapt to the feature of the channel, an optimization problem is formulated for determining the mode currents on the transmitter, aiming to obtain the optimal design of the precoder and combiner. We make comprehensive analyses to investigate the relationship among the spatial degree of freedom, noise, and transmitted power, thereby establishing a rigorous upper bound of channel capacity. A series of simulations are conducted to validate the theoretical model and numerical method. This work offers a novel perspective and methodology for understanding and leveraging EIT, and provides a theoretical foundation for the design and optimization of future wireless communications.</p></details> | 31pages, 8 figures |

In recent years, self-supervised learning has emerged as a promising approach for transfer learning in various domains. However, its application to EEG signals remains largely unexplored. In this article, we introduce Signal-JEPA for representing EEG recordings which includes a novel domain-specific spatial block masking strategy and three novel architectures for downstream classification. The study is conducted on a 54 subjects dataset and the downstream performance of the models is evaluated on three different BCI paradigms: motor imagery, ERP and SSVEP. Our study provides preliminary evidence for the potential of JEPAs in EEG signal encoding. Notably, our results highlight the importance of spatial filtering for accurate downstream classification and reveal an influence of the length of the pre-training examples but not of the mask size on the downstream performance.</p></details> |  |

Although significant progress has been made, blind image quality assessment remains a difficult task since images vary in content and distortions. Most algorithms generate quality without emphasizing the important region of interest. In order to solve this, a multi-stream spatial and channel attention-based algorithm is being proposed. This algorithm generates more accurate predictions with a high correlation to human perceptual assessment by combining hybrid features from two different backbones, followed by spatial and channel attention to provide high weights to the region of interest. Four legacy image quality assessment datasets are used to validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Authentic and synthetic distortion image databases are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and we show that it has excellent generalization properties with a particular focus on the perceptual foreground information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated article is submitted in Springer Nature scientific reports and will be published</p></details> |
| **[Using spatial extreme-value theory with machine learning to model and understand spatially compounding weather extremes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12195v4)** | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When extreme weather events affect large areas, their regional to sub-continental spatial scale is important for their impacts. We propose a novel machine learning (ML) framework that integrates spatial extreme-value theory to model weather extremes and to quantify probabilities associated with the occurrence, intensity, and spatial extent of these events. Our approach employs new loss functions adapted to extreme values, enabling our model to prioritize the tail rather than the bulk of the data distribution. Applied to a case study of Western European summertime heat extremes, we use daily 500-hPa geopotential height fields and local soil moisture as predictors to capture the complex interplay between local and remote physical processes. Our generative model reveals the importance of individual circulation features in determining different facets of heat extremes, thereby enriching our process understanding from a data-driven perspective. Heat extremes are sensitive to the relative position of upper-level ridges and troughs that are part of a large-scale wave pattern. Our approach can extrapolate beyond the range of the data to make risk-related probabilistic statements. It applies more generally to other weather extremes and offers an alternative to traditional physical and ML-based techniques that focus less on the extremal aspects of weather data.</p></details> |  |
| **[IGroupSS-Mamba: Interval Group Spatial-Spectral Mamba for Hyperspectral Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05100v1)** | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification has garnered substantial attention in remote sensing fields. Recent Mamba architectures built upon the Selective State Space Models (S6) have demonstrated enormous potential in long-range sequence modeling. However, the high dimensionality of hyperspectral data and information redundancy pose challenges to the application of Mamba in HSI classification, suffering from suboptimal performance and computational efficiency. In light of this, this paper investigates a lightweight Interval Group Spatial-Spectral Mamba framework (IGroupSS-Mamba) for HSI classification, which allows for multi-directional and multi-scale global spatial-spectral information extraction in a grouping and hierarchical manner. Technically, an Interval Group S6 Mechanism (IGSM) is developed as the core component, which partitions high-dimensional features into multiple non-overlapping groups at intervals, and then integrates a unidirectional S6 for each group with a specific scanning direction to achieve non-redundant sequence modeling. Compared to conventional applying multi-directional scanning to all bands, this grouping strategy leverages the complementary strengths of different scanning directions while decreasing computational costs. To adequately capture the spatial-spectral contextual information, an Interval Group Spatial-Spectral Block (IGSSB) is introduced, in which two IGSM-based spatial and spectral operators are cascaded to characterize the global spatial-spectral relationship along the spatial and spectral dimensions, respectively. IGroupSS-Mamba is constructed as a hierarchical structure stacked by multiple IGSSB blocks, integrating a pixel aggregation-based downsampling strategy for multiscale spatial-spectral semantic learning from shallow to deep stages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IGroupSS-Mamba outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[PredFormer: Transformers Are Effective Spatial-Temporal Predictive Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04733v1)** | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal predictive learning methods generally fall into two categories: recurrent-based approaches, which face challenges in parallelization and performance, and recurrent-free methods, which employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as encoder-decoder architectures. These methods benefit from strong inductive biases but often at the expense of scalability and generalization. This paper proposes PredFormer, a pure transformer-based framework for spatiotemporal predictive learning. Motivated by the Vision Transformers (ViT) design, PredFormer leverages carefully designed Gated Transformer blocks, following a comprehensive analysis of 3D attention mechanisms, including full-, factorized-, and interleaved- spatial-temporal attention. With its recurrent-free, transformer-based design, PredFormer is both simple and efficient, significantly outperforming previous methods by large margins. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that PredFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance. On Moving MNIST, PredFormer achieves a 51.3% reduction in MSE relative to SimVP. For TaxiBJ, the model decreases MSE by 33.1% and boosts FPS from 533 to 2364. Additionally, on WeatherBench, it reduces MSE by 11.1% while enhancing FPS from 196 to 404. These performance gains in both accuracy and efficiency demonstrate PredFormer's potential for real-world applications. The source code will be released at https://github.com/yyyujintang/PredFormer.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |

AR research has long focused on the potential of context awareness, demonstrating novel capabilities that leverage the semantics in the 3D environment for various object-level interactions. Meanwhile, the computer vision community has made leaps in neural vision-language understanding to enhance environment perception for autonomous tasks. In this work, we introduce a multimodal 3D object representation that unifies both semantic and linguistic knowledge with the geometric representation, enabling user-guided machine learning involving physical objects. We first present a fast multimodal 3D reconstruction pipeline that brings linguistic understanding to AR by fusing CLIP vision-language features into the environment and object models. We then propose "in-situ" machine learning, which, in conjunction with the multimodal representation, enables new tools and interfaces for users to interact with physical spaces and objects in a spatially and linguistically meaningful manner. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed system through two real-world AR applications on Magic Leap 2: a) spatial search in physical environments with natural language and b) an intelligent inventory system that tracks object changes over time. We also make our full implementation and demo data available at (https://github.com/cy-xu/spatially_aware_AI) to encourage further exploration and research in spatially aware AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, accepted to IEEE ISMAR 2024</p></details> |
| **[Spatial Multiplexing Oriented Channel Reconfiguration in Multi-IRS Aided MIMO Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04414v1)** | 2024-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial multiplexing plays a significant role in improving the capacity of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems. To improve the spectral efficiency (SE) of a point-to-point MIMO system, we exploit the channel reconfiguration capabilities provided by multiple intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) to enhance the spatial multiplexing. Unlike most existing works, we address both the issues of the IRSs placement and elements allocation. To this end, we first introduce an orthogonal placement strategy to mitigate channel correlation, thereby enabling interference-free multi-stream transmission. Subsequently, we propose a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based approach to jointly optimize the IRS elements and power allocation. Our theoretical analysis unveils that equal IRS elements/power allocation scheme becomes asymptotically optimal as the number of IRS elements and transmit power tend to be infinite. Numerical results demonstrate that when the total number of IRS elements or the power exceeds a certain threshold, a multi-IRS assisted system outperforms a single IRS configuration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximate Maximum Likelihood Inference for Acoustic Spatial Capture-Recapture with Unknown Identities, Using Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04390v1)** | 2024-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Acoustic spatial capture-recapture (ASCR) surveys with an array of synchronized acoustic detectors can be an effective way of estimating animal density or call density. However, constructing the capture histories required for ASCR analysis is challenging, as recognizing which detections at different detectors are of which calls is not a trivial task. Because calls from different distances take different times to arrive at detectors, the order in which calls are detected is not necessarily the same as the order in which they are made, and without knowing which detections are of the same call, we do not know how many different calls are detected. We propose a Monte Carlo expectation-maximization (MCEM) estimation method to resolve this unknown call identity problem. To implement the MCEM method in this context, we sample the latent variables from a complete-data likelihood model in the expectation step and use a semi-complete-data likelihood or conditional likelihood in the maximization step. We use a parametric bootstrap to obtain confidence intervals. When we apply our method to a survey of moss frogs, it gives an estimate within 15% of the estimate obtained using data with call capture histories constructed by experts, and unlike this latter estimate, our confidence interval incorporates the uncertainty about call identities. Simulations show it to have a low bias (6%) and coverage probabilities close to the nominal 95% value.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 3 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

We propose a novel, spatial cross-fitting estimator of the parametric component based on random thinning, a common simulation technique in point processes. The proposed estimator is shown to be consistent and in many settings, asymptotically Normal. Also, we generalize the notion of semiparametric efficiency lower bound in i.i.d. settings to spatial point processes and show that the proposed estimator achieves the efficiency lower bound if the process is Poisson. Next, we present a new spatial kernel regression estimator that can estimate the nonparametric component of the intensity function at the desired rates for inference. Despite the dependence induced by the point process, we show that our estimator can be computed using existing software for generalized partial linear models in i.i.d. settings. We conclude with a small simulation study and a re-analysis of the spatial distribution of rainforest trees.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we propose a Hierarchical Spatial Proximity Reasoning (HSPR) method. First, we introduce a scene understanding auxiliary task to help the agent build a knowledge base of hierarchical spatial proximity. This task utilizes panoramic views and object features to identify types of nodes and uncover the adjacency relationships between nodes, objects, and between nodes and objects. Second, we propose a multi-step reasoning navigation algorithm based on the hierarchical spatial proximity knowledge base, which continuously plans feasible paths to enhance exploration efficiency. Third, we introduce a residual fusion method to improve navigation decision accuracy. Finally, we validate our approach with experiments on publicly available datasets including REVERIE, SOON, R2R, and R4R. Our code is available at https://github.com/iCityLab/HSPR</p></details> |  |
| **[Adjusting for Spatial Correlation in Machine and Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04312v1)** | 2024-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial data display correlation between observations collected at neighboring locations. Generally, machine and deep learning methods either do not account for this correlation or do so indirectly through correlated features and thereby forfeit predictive accuracy. To remedy this shortcoming, we propose preprocessing the data using a spatial decorrelation transform derived from properties of a multivariate Gaussian distribution and Vecchia approximations. The transformed data can then be ported into a machine or deep learning tool. After model fitting on the transformed data, the output can be spatially re-correlated via the corresponding inverse transformation. We show that including this spatial adjustment results in higher predictive accuracy on simulated and real spatial datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[GravMAD: Grounded Spatial Value Maps Guided Action Diffusion for Generalized 3D Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20154v3)** | 2024-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots' ability to follow language instructions and execute diverse 3D tasks is vital in robot learning. Traditional imitation learning-based methods perform well on seen tasks but struggle with novel, unseen ones due to variability. Recent approaches leverage large foundation models to assist in understanding novel tasks, thereby mitigating this issue. However, these methods lack a task-specific learning process, which is essential for an accurate understanding of 3D environments, often leading to execution failures. In this paper, we introduce GravMAD, a sub-goal-driven, language-conditioned action diffusion framework that combines the strengths of imitation learning and foundation models. Our approach breaks tasks into sub-goals based on language instructions, allowing auxiliary guidance during both training and inference. During training, we introduce Sub-goal Keypose Discovery to identify key sub-goals from demonstrations. Inference differs from training, as there are no demonstrations available, so we use pre-trained foundation models to bridge the gap and identify sub-goals for the current task. In both phases, GravMaps are generated from sub-goals, providing flexible 3D spatial guidance compared to fixed 3D positions. Empirical evaluations on RLBench show that GravMAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with a 28.63% improvement on novel tasks and a 13.36% gain on tasks encountered during training. These results demonstrate GravMAD's strong multi-task learning and generalization in 3D manipulation.

This issue can significantly disrupt systems that rely on the data. Spatial and temporal dependencies can be leveraged to impute the missing samples. Existing imputation methods often ignore dynamic changes in spatial dependencies. We propose a Spatial Dynamic Aware Graph Recurrent Imputation Network (SDA-GRIN) which is capable of capturing dynamic changes in spatial dependencies.SDA-GRIN leverages a multi-head attention mechanism to adapt graph structures with time. SDA-GRIN models multivariate time series as a sequence of temporal graphs and uses a recurrent message-passing architecture for imputation. We evaluate SDA-GRIN on four real-world datasets: SDA-GRIN improves MSE by 9.51% for the AQI and 9.40% for AQI-36. On the PEMS-BAY dataset, it achieves a 1.94% improvement in MSE. Detailed ablation study demonstrates the effect of window sizes and missing data on the performance of the method. Project page:https://ameskandari.github.io/sda-grin/</p></details> |  |

However, long video understanding presents unique challenges due to the complexity of reasoning over extended timespans, even for zero-shot LLM-based approaches. The challenge of information redundancy in long videos prompts the question of what specific information is essential for large language models (LLMs) and how to leverage them for complex spatial-temporal reasoning in long-form video analysis. We propose a framework VideoINSTA, i.e. INformative Spatial-TemporAl Reasoning for zero-shot long-form video understanding. VideoINSTA contributes (1) a zero-shot framework for long video understanding using LLMs; (2) an event-based temporal reasoning and content-based spatial reasoning approach for LLMs to reason over spatial-temporal information in videos; (3) a self-reflective information reasoning scheme balancing temporal factors based on information sufficiency and prediction confidence. Our model significantly improves the state-of-the-art on three long video question-answering benchmarks: EgoSchema, NextQA, and IntentQA, and the open question answering dataset ActivityNetQA.

However, current 3D-based LLMs fall short in situated understanding due to two key limitations: 1) existing 3D datasets are constructed from a global perspective of the 3D scenes and lack situated context. 2) the architectures of existing 3D-based LLMs lack explicit alignment between the spatial representations of 3D scenes and natural language, limiting their performance in tasks requiring precise spatial reasoning. We address these issues by introducing a scalable situated 3D dataset, named Spartun3D, that incorporates various situated spatial reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we propose Spartun3D-LLM, built on an existing 3D-based LLM but integrated with a novel situated spatial alignment module, aiming to enhance the alignment between 3D visual representations and their corresponding textual descriptions. Experimental results demonstrate that both our proposed dataset and alignment module significantly enhance the situated spatial understanding of 3D-based LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling and Analysis of Spatial and Temporal Land Clutter Statistics in SAR Imaging Based on MSTAR Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03816v1)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The statistical analysis of land clutter for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging has become an increasingly important subject for research and investigation. It is also absolutely necessary for designing robust algorithms capable of performing the task of target detection in the background clutter. Any attempt to extract the energy of the desired targets from the land clutter requires complete knowledge of the statistical properties of the background clutter. In this paper, the spatial as well as the temporal characteristics of the land clutter are studied. Since the data for each image has been collected based on a different aspect angle; therefore, the temporal analysis contains variation in the aspect angle. Consequently, the temporal analysis includes the characteristics of the radar cross section with respect to the aspect angle based on which the data has been collected. In order to perform the statistical analysis, several well-known and relevant distributions, namely, Weibull, Log-normal, Gamma, and Rayleigh are considered as prime candidates to model the land clutter. The goodness-of-fit test is based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence metric. The detailed analysis presented in this paper demonstrates that the Weibull distribution is a more accurate fit for the temporal-aspect-angle statistical analysis while the Rayleigh distribution models the spatial characteristics of the background clutter with higher accuracy. Finally, based on the aforementioned statistical analyses and by utilizing the Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) algorithm, we perform target detection in land clutter. The overall verification of the analysis is performed by exploiting the Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) data-set, which has been collected in spotlight mode at X-band, and the results are presented.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2409.02155</p></details> |

Many papers have been published exploring the dynamics of ESCGs where competitive inter-species predator/prey relationships are modelled via the cyclic game Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) for three species, or Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock (RPSLS) for five. At the core of these simulations is the "Elementary Step" (ES), in which one or two agents are chosen at random to either compete to the death, or to reproduce, or to move location. ESCG studies typically involve executing trillions of ESs and hence the computational efficiency of the core ES algorithm is a key concern. In this paper I demonstrate that the de facto standard "Original ES" (OES) algorithm is computationally inefficient both in time and in space due to the implicit execution of many "no-op" commands (i.e., commands that do nothing) and because at steady state large numbers of cells can be empty, and yet empty cells serve no purpose. I present a new "Revised ES" (RES) algorithm which eliminates these inefficiencies, and I show empirically that ESCGs with RES exhibit qualitatively the same characteristics as those with OES, and are also markedly more stable. The more stable dynamics of RES-based simulations means that they can be run with smaller lattices than when using OES, leading to reductions in total simulation times of 85% or more.

Here, we investigate the optimal placement of such receptors through a theoretical model that minimizes uncertainty in gradient estimation. Without requiring a priori knowledge of the physical limits of sensing or biochemical processes, we reproduce the emergence of clusters that closely resemble those observed in real cells. On perfect spherical surfaces, optimally placed receptors spread uniformly. When perturbations break their symmetry, receptors cluster in regions of high curvature, massively reducing estimation uncertainty. This agrees with mechanistic models that minimize elastic preference discrepancies between receptors and cell membranes. We further extend our model to motile receptors responding to cell-shape changes and external fluid flow, demonstrating the relevance of our model in realistic scenarios. Our findings provide a simple and utilitarian explanation for receptor clustering at high-curvature regions when high sensing accuracy is paramount.</p></details> |  |

I replicate the results presented by Zhong et al. for interaction structures with one, two, three, and four arcs ablated from the dominance network. I then empirically demonstrate that the dynamics of the RPSLS ESCG have sufficiently long time constants that the true asymptotic outcomes can often only be identified after running the ablated ESCG for 10,000,000MCS or longer, and that the true long-term outcomes can be markedly less diverse than those reported by Zhong et al. as asymptotic. Finally I demonstrate that, when run for sufficiently many MCS, the original unablated RPSLS system exhibits essentially the same asymptotic outcomes as the ablated RPSLS systems, and in this sense the only causal effect of the ablations is to alter the time required for the system to converge to the long-term asymptotic states that the unablated system eventually settles to anyhow.</p></details> | <details><summary>86 Pa...</summary><p>86 Pages, 49 Figures, 41 References</p></details> |
| **[Assessing Spatial Disparities: A Bayesian Linear Regression Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19171v2)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Epidemiological investigations of regionally aggregated spatial data often involve detecting spatial health disparities between neighboring regions on a map of disease mortality or incidence rates. Analyzing such data introduces spatial dependence among the health outcomes and seeks to report statistically significant spatial disparities by delineating boundaries that separate neighboring regions with widely disparate health outcomes. However, current statistical methods are often inadequate for appropriately defining what constitutes a spatial disparity and for constructing rankings of posterior probabilities that are robust under changes to such a definition. More specifically, non-parametric Bayesian approaches endow spatial effects with discrete probability distributions using Dirichlet processes, or generalizations thereof, and rely upon computationally intensive methods for inferring on weakly identified parameters. In this manuscript, we introduce a Bayesian linear regression framework to detect spatial health disparities. This enables us to exploit Bayesian conjugate posterior distributions in a more accessible manner and accelerate computation significantly over existing Bayesian non-parametric approaches. Simulation experiments conducted over a county map of the entire United States demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and we apply our method to a data set from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) on age-standardized US county-level estimates of mortality rates across tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer.</p></details> | 54 pages, 8 figures |

Ring attractors, as specialized brain-inspired structures that encode spatial information and uncertainty, offer a biologically plausible mechanism to improve learning speed and predictive performance. They do so by explicitly encoding the action space, facilitating the organization of neural activity, and enabling the distribution of spatial representations across the neural network in the context of deep RL. The application of ring attractors in the RL action selection process involves mapping actions to specific locations on the ring and decoding the selected action based on neural activity. We investigate the application of ring attractors by both building them as exogenous models and integrating them as part of a Deep Learning policy algorithm. Our results show a significant improvement in state-of-the-art models for the Atari 100k benchmark. Notably, our integrated approach improves the performance of state-of-the-art models by half, representing a 53\% increase over selected baselines.</p></details> |  |

This motivates us to jointly analyze active fires and population changes in the U.S. from July 2020 to June 2021. The available data are recorded on different scales (or spatial resolutions) and by different types of distributions (referred to as multi-type data). Moreover, wildfires are known to have feedback mechanism that creates signal-to-noise dependence. We analyze point-referenced remote sensing fire data from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and county-level population change data provided by U.S. Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program (PEP). To do this, we develop a multiscale multi-type spatial Bayesian hierarchical model that assumes the average number of fires is zero-inflated normal, the incidence of fire as Bernoulli, and the percentage population change as normally distributed. This high-dimensional dataset makes Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) implementation infeasible. We bypass MCMC by extending a computationally efficient Bayesian framework to directly sample from the exact posterior distribution, referred to as Exact Posterior Regression (EPR), which includes a term to model feedback. A simulation study is included to compare our new EPR method to the traditional Bayesian model fitted via MCMC. In our analysis, we obtained predictions of wildfire probabilities, identified several useful covariates, and found that regions with many fires were directly related to population change.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exact Bayesian Inference for Multivariate Spatial Data of Any Size with Application to Air Pollution Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02655v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine particulate matter and aerosol optical thickness are of interest to atmospheric scientists for understanding air quality and its various health/environmental impacts. The available data are extremely large, making uncertainty quantification in a fully Bayesian framework quite difficult, as traditional implementations do not scale reasonably to the size of the data. We specifically consider roughly 8 million observations obtained from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument. To analyze data on this scale, we introduce Scalable Multivariate Exact Posterior Regression (SM-EPR) which combines the recently introduced data subset approach and Exact Posterior Regression (EPR). EPR is a new Bayesian hierarchical model where it is possible to sample independent replicates of fixed and random effects directly from the posterior without the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or approximate Bayesian techniques. We extend EPR to the multivariate spatial context, where the multiple variables may be distributed according to different distributions. The combination of the data subset approach with EPR allows one to perform exact Bayesian inference without MCMC for effectively any sample size. We demonstrate our new SM-EPR method using this motivating big remote sensing data application and provide several simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Multi-Cuts for Online Multiple-Camera Vehicle Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02638v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate online multiple-camera vehicle tracking is essential for intelligent transportation systems, autonomous driving, and smart city applications. Like single-camera multiple-object tracking, it is commonly formulated as a graph problem of tracking-by-detection. Within this framework, existing online methods usually consist of two-stage procedures that cluster temporally first, then spatially, or vice versa. This is computationally expensive and prone to error accumulation. We introduce a graph representation that allows spatial-temporal clustering in a single, combined step: New detections are spatially and temporally connected with existing clusters. By keeping sparse appearance and positional cues of all detections in a cluster, our method can compare clusters based on the strongest available evidence. The final tracks are obtained online using a simple multicut assignment procedure. Our method does not require any training on the target scene, pre-extraction of single-camera tracks, or additional annotations. Notably, we outperform the online state-of-the-art on the CityFlow dataset in terms of IDF1 by more than 14%, and on the Synthehicle dataset by more than 25%, respectively. The code is publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Density based Spatial Clustering of Lines via Probabilistic Generation of Neighbourhood](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02290v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Density based spatial clustering of points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ has a myriad of applications in a variety of industries. We generalise this problem to the density based clustering of lines in high-dimensional spaces, keeping in mind there exists no valid distance measure that follows the triangle inequality for lines. In this paper, we design a clustering algorithm that generates a customised neighbourhood for a line of a fixed volume (given as a parameter), based on an optional parameter as a continuous probability density function. This algorithm is not sensitive to the outliers and can effectively identify the noise in the data using a cardinality parameter. One of the pivotal applications of this algorithm is clustering data points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with missing entries, while utilising the domain knowledge of the respective data. In particular, the proposed algorithm is able to cluster $n$-dimensional data points that contain at least $(n-1)$-dimensional information. We illustrate the neighbourhoods for the standard probability distributions with continuous probability density functions and demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on various synthetic and real-world datasets (e.g., rail and road networks). The experimental results also highlight its application in clustering incomplete data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Encoding arbitrary Ising Hamiltonians on Spatial Photonic Ising Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09161v2)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photonic Ising Machines constitute an emergent new paradigm of computation, geared towards tackling combinatorial optimization problems that can be reduced to the problem of finding the ground state of an Ising model. Spatial Photonic Ising Machines have proven to be advantageous for simulating fully connected large-scale spin systems. However, fine control of a general interaction matrix $J$ has so far only been accomplished through eigenvalue decomposition methods that either limit the scalability or increase the execution time of the optimization process. We introduce and experimentally validate a SPIM instance that enables direct control over the full interaction matrix, enabling the encoding of Ising Hamiltonians with arbitrary couplings and connectivity. We demonstrate the conformity of the experimentally measured Ising energy with the theoretically expected values and then proceed to solve both the unweighted and weighted graph partitioning problems, showcasing a systematic convergence to an optimal solution via simulated annealing. Our approach greatly expands the applicability of SPIMs for real-world applications without sacrificing any of the inherent advantages of the system, and paves the way to encoding the full range of NP problems that are known to be equivalent to Ising models, on SPIM devices.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

Numerous computational methods exist, but varying SVG definitions and methodologies lead to incomparable results. We review 33 state-of-the-art methods, categorizing SVGs into three types: overall, cell-type-specific, and spatial-domain-marker SVGs. Our review explains the intuitions underlying these methods, summarizes their applications, and categorizes the hypothesis tests they use in the trade-off between generality and specificity for SVG detection. We discuss challenges in SVG detection and propose future directions for improvement. Our review offers insights for method developers and users, advocating for category-specific benchmarking.</p></details> |  |
| **[ClassContrast: Bridging the Spatial and Contextual Gaps for Node Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02158v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have revolutionized the domain of graph representation learning by utilizing neighborhood aggregation schemes in many popular architectures, such as message passing graph neural networks (MPGNNs). This scheme involves iteratively calculating a node's representation vector by aggregating and transforming the representation vectors of its adjacent nodes. Despite their effectiveness, MPGNNs face significant issues, such as oversquashing, oversmoothing, and underreaching, which hamper their effectiveness. Additionally, the reliance of MPGNNs on the homophily assumption, where edges typically connect nodes with similar labels and features, limits their performance in heterophilic contexts, where connected nodes often have significant differences. This necessitates the development of models that can operate effectively in both homophilic and heterophilic settings. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, ClassContrast, grounded in Energy Landscape Theory from Chemical Physics, to overcome these limitations. ClassContrast combines spatial and contextual information, leveraging a physics-inspired energy landscape to model node embeddings that are both discriminative and robust across homophilic and heterophilic settings. Our approach introduces contrast-based homophily matrices to enhance the understanding of class interactions and tendencies. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ClassContrast outperforms traditional GNNs in node classification and link prediction tasks, proving its effectiveness and versatility in diverse real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Engagement Measurement Based on Facial Landmarks and Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17175v2)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Engagement in virtual learning is crucial for a variety of factors including student satisfaction, performance, and compliance with learning programs, but measuring it is a challenging task. There is therefore considerable interest in utilizing artificial intelligence and affective computing to measure engagement in natural settings as well as on a large scale. This paper introduces a novel, privacy-preserving method for engagement measurement from videos. It uses facial landmarks, which carry no personally identifiable information, extracted from videos via the MediaPipe deep learning solution. The extracted facial landmarks are fed to Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (ST-GCNs) to output the engagement level of the student in the video. To integrate the ordinal nature of the engagement variable into the training process, ST-GCNs undergo training in a novel ordinal learning framework based on transfer learning. Experimental results on two video student engagement measurement datasets show the superiority of the proposed method compared to previous methods with improved state-of-the-art on the EngageNet dataset with a 3.1% improvement in four-class engagement level classification accuracy and on the Online Student Engagement dataset with a 1.5% improvement in binary engagement classification accuracy. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was applied to the developed ST-GCNs to interpret the engagement measurements obtained by the proposed method in both the spatial and temporal domains. The relatively lightweight and fast ST-GCN and its integration with the real-time MediaPipe make the proposed approach capable of being deployed on virtual learning platforms and measuring engagement in real-time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Polynomial growth in degree-dependent first passage percolation on spatial random graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11880v3)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we study a version of (non-Markovian) first passage percolation on graphs, where the transmission time between two connected vertices is non-iid, but increases by a penalty factor polynomial in their expected degrees. Based on the exponent of the penalty-polynomial, this makes it increasingly harder to transmit to and from high-degree vertices. This choice is motivated by awareness or time-limitations. For the iid part of the transmission times we allow any nonnegative distribution with regularly varying behaviour at $0$. For the underlying graph models we choose spatial random graphs that have power-law degree distributions, so that the effect of the penalisation becomes visible: (finite and infinite) Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs, and Scale-Free Percolation. In these spatial models, the connection probability between two vertices depends on their spatial distance and on their expected degrees. We prove that upon increasing the penalty exponent, the transmission time between two far away vertices $x,y$ sweeps through four universal phases even for a single underlying graph: explosive (tight transmission times), polylogarithmic, polynomial but sublinear ($|x-y|^{\eta_0+o(1)}$ for an explicit $\eta_0<1$), and linear ($\Theta(|x-y|)$) in their Euclidean distance. Further, none of these phases are restricted to phase boundaries, and those are non-trivial in the main model parameters: the tail of the degree-distribution, a long-range parameter, and the exponent of regular variation of the iid part of the transmission times. In this paper we present proofs of lower bounds for the latter two phases and the upper bound for the linear phase. These complement the matching upper bounds for the polynomial regime in our companion paper.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages.

While the most common solutions target almost exclusively areal data or geostatistical data modelling by splines, we aim to extend some resolution methods in the context of geostatistical data modelling by Gaussian Markov Random Fields (GMRF) using R-INLA methodology. 2 - First, we present three approaches for alleviating spatial confounding: Restricted Spatial Regression (RSR), Spatial+, and its recent simplified version, called here Spatial+ 2.0. We show how each can be implemented from geostatistical data in a GMRF framework using R-inlabru. 3 - Next, a simulation study that reproduces a spatial confounding phenomenon is carried out to assess the coherence of the extensions with the expectations of these methods. Finally, we apply the expanded methods to a case study, linking cadmium (Cd) concentration in terrestrial mosses to Cd concentration in air. 4 - Our findings support the feasibility of our extended approach of spatial confounding resolution methods to geostatistical data using R-INLA in keeping with the previous contexts, although certain precautions and limitations must be considered.</p></details> | 39 pages, 5 figures |

Weakly supervised learning of tile-level data is typically applied for tasks where labels only exist on the patient or WSI level (e.g. patient outcomes or histological grading). In this context, there is a need for improved spatial interpretability of predictions from such models. We propose a novel method, Wsi rEgion sElection aPproach (WEEP), for model interpretation. It provides a principled yet straightforward way to establish the spatial area of WSI required for assigning a particular prediction label. We demonstrate WEEP on a binary classification task in the area of breast cancer computational pathology. WEEP is easy to implement, is directly connected to the model-based decision process, and offers information relevant to both research and diagnostic applications.</p></details> |  |

However, the limited FOV interrupts the generation of descriptions and impacts place recognition adversely. Therefore, we suffer from correcting accumulated drift errors in a consistent map using LiDAR-based place recognition with limited FOV. Thus, in this paper, we propose a robust LiDAR-based place recognition method for handling narrow FOV scenarios. The proposed method establishes spatial organization based on the range-elevation bin and azimuth-elevation bin to represent places. In addition, we achieve a robust place description through reweighting based on vertical direction information. Based on these representations, our method enables addressing rotational changes and determining the initial heading. Additionally, we designed a lightweight and fast approach for the robot's onboard autonomy. For rigorous validation, the proposed method was tested across various LiDAR place recognition scenarios (i.e., single-session, multi-session, and multi-robot scenarios). To the best of our knowledge, we report the first method to cope with the restricted FOV. Our place description and SLAM codes will be released. Also, the supplementary materials of our descriptor are available at \texttt{\url{https://sites.google.com/view/lidar-solid}}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (2024)</p></details> |
| **[RS-FME-SwinT: A Novel Feature Map Enhancement Framework Integrating Customized SwinT with Residual and Spatial CNN for Monkeypox Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01216v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monkeypox (MPox) has emerged as a significant global concern, with cases steadily increasing daily. Conventional detection methods, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and manual examination, exhibit challenges of low sensitivity, high cost, and substantial workload. Therefore, deep learning offers an automated solution; however, the datasets include data scarcity, texture, contrast, inter-intra class variability, and similarities with other skin infectious diseases. In this regard, a novel hybrid approach is proposed that integrates the learning capacity of Residual Learning and Spatial Exploitation Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a customized Swin Transformer (RS-FME-SwinT) to capture multi-scale global and local correlated features for MPox diagnosis. The proposed RS-FME-SwinT technique employs a transfer learning-based feature map enhancement (FME) technique, integrating the customized SwinT for global information capture, residual blocks for texture extraction, and spatial blocks for local contrast variations. Moreover, incorporating new inverse residual blocks within the proposed SwinT effectively captures local patterns and mitigates vanishing gradients. The proposed RS-FME-SwinT has strong learning potential of diverse features that systematically reduce intra-class MPox variation and enable precise discrimination from other skin diseases. Finally, the proposed RS-FME-SwinT is a holdout cross-validated on a diverse MPox dataset and achieved outperformance on state-of-the-art CNNs and ViTs. The proposed RS-FME-SwinT demonstrates commendable results of an accuracy of 97.80%, sensitivity of 96.82%, precision of 98.06%, and an F-score of 97.44% in MPox detection. The RS-FME-SwinT could be a valuable tool for healthcare practitioners, enabling prompt and accurate MPox diagnosis and contributing significantly to mitigation efforts.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 Pa...</summary><p>37 Pages, 5 Tables, 10 Figures</p></details> |
| **[Spatial Visibility and Temporal Dynamics: Revolutionizing Field of View Prediction in Adaptive Point Cloud Video Streaming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18236v2)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Field-of-View (FoV) adaptive streaming significantly reduces bandwidth requirement of immersive point cloud video (PCV) by only transmitting visible points in a viewer's FoV. The traditional approaches often focus on trajectory-based 6 degree-of-freedom (6DoF) FoV predictions. The predicted FoV is then used to calculate point visibility. Such approaches do not explicitly consider video content's impact on viewer attention, and the conversion from FoV to point visibility is often error-prone and time-consuming. We reformulate the PCV FoV prediction problem from the cell visibility perspective, allowing for precise decision-making regarding the transmission of 3D data at the cell level based on the predicted visibility distribution. We develop a novel spatial visibility and object-aware graph model that leverages the historical 3D visibility data and incorporates spatial perception, neighboring cell correlation, and occlusion information to predict the cell visibility in the future. Our model significantly improves the long-term cell visibility prediction, reducing the prediction MSE loss by up to 50% compared to the state-of-the-art models while maintaining real-time performance (more than 30fps) for point cloud videos with over 1 million points.</p></details> |  |

| **[Spatial Action Unit Cues for Interpretable Deep Facial Expression Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01848v1)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although state-of-the-art classifiers for facial expression recognition (FER) can achieve a high level of accuracy, they lack interpretability, an important feature for end-users. Experts typically associate spatial action units (AUs) from a codebook to facial regions for the visual interpretation of expressions. In this paper, the same expert steps are followed. A new learning strategy is proposed to explicitly incorporate AU cues into classifier training, allowing to train deep interpretable models. During training, this AU codebook is used, along with the input image expression label, and facial landmarks, to construct a AU heatmap that indicates the most discriminative image regions of interest w.r.t the facial expression. This valuable spatial cue is leveraged to train a deep interpretable classifier for FER. This is achieved by constraining the spatial layer features of a classifier to be correlated with AU heatmaps. Using a composite loss, the classifier is trained to correctly classify an image while yielding interpretable visual layer-wise attention correlated with AU maps, simulating the expert decision process. Our strategy only relies on image class expression for supervision, without additional manual annotations. Our new strategy is generic, and can be applied to any deep CNN- or transformer-based classifier without requiring any architectural change or significant additional training time. Our extensive evaluation on two public benchmarks RAF-DB, and AffectNet datasets shows that our proposed strategy can improve layer-wise interpretability without degrading classification performance. In addition, we explore a common type of interpretable classifiers that rely on class activation mapping (CAM) methods, and show that our approach can also improve CAM interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 2 figures, AI and Digital Health Symposium 2024, October 18th 2024, Montr\'eal</p></details> |
| **[Robust Traffic Forecasting against Spatial Shift over Years](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00373v1)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) and Transformers have demonstrated promising potential for traffic forecasting by effectively capturing both temporal and spatial correlations. The generalization ability of spatiotemporal models has received considerable attention in recent scholarly discourse. However, no substantive datasets specifically addressing traffic out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios have been proposed. Existing ST-OOD methods are either constrained to testing on extant data or necessitate manual modifications to the dataset. Consequently, the generalization capacity of current spatiotemporal models in OOD scenarios remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we investigate state-of-the-art models using newly proposed traffic OOD benchmarks and, surprisingly, find that these models experience a significant decline in performance. Through meticulous analysis, we attribute this decline to the models' inability to adapt to previously unobserved spatial relationships. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, which learns a set of graph generators (i.e., graphons) during training and adaptively combines them to generate new graphs based on novel environmental conditions to handle spatial distribution shifts during testing. We further extend this concept to the Transformer architecture, achieving substantial improvements. Our method is both parsimonious and efficacious, and can be seamlessly integrated into any spatiotemporal model, outperforming current state-of-the-art approaches in addressing spatial dynamics.</p></details> |  |

Accurate modeling and forecasting of these datasets can be extremely useful for policymakers to develop informed strategies for future planning. Echo State Networks (ESNs) are efficient methods for capturing nonlinear temporal dynamics and generating forecasts. However, ESNs lack a direct mechanism to account for the neighborhood structure inherent in area-level data. Ignoring these spatial relationships can significantly compromise the accuracy and utility of forecasts. In this paper, we incorporate approximate graph spectral filters at the input stage of the ESN, thereby improving forecast accuracy while preserving the model's computational efficiency during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using Eurostat's tourism occupancy dataset and show how it can support more informed decision-making in policy and planning contexts.</p></details> | 23 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Get Rid of Task Isolation: A Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10524v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal learning has become a pivotal technique to enable urban intelligence. Traditional spatiotemporal models mostly focus on a specific task by assuming a same distribution between training and testing sets. However, given that urban systems are usually dynamic, multi-sourced with imbalanced data distributions, current specific task-specific models fail to generalize to new urban conditions and adapt to new domains without explicitly modeling interdependencies across various dimensions and types of urban data. To this end, we argue that there is an essential to propose a Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal learning framework (CMuST) to empower collective urban intelligence, which reforms the urban spatiotemporal learning from single-domain to cooperatively multi-dimensional and multi-task learning. Specifically, CMuST proposes a new multi-dimensional spatiotemporal interaction network (MSTI) to allow cross-interactions between context and main observations as well as self-interactions within spatial and temporal aspects to be exposed, which is also the core for capturing task-level commonality and personalization. To ensure continuous task learning, a novel Rolling Adaptation training scheme (RoAda) is devised, which not only preserves task uniqueness by constructing data summarization-driven task prompts, but also harnesses correlated patterns among tasks by iterative model behavior modeling. We further establish a benchmark of three cities for multi-task spatiotemporal learning, and empirically demonstrate the superiority of CMuST via extensive evaluations on these datasets. The impressive improvements on both few-shot streaming data and new domain tasks against existing SOAT methods are achieved. Code is available at https://github.com/DILab-USTCSZ/CMuST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Our focus lies in the parametric estimation of its intensity function, incorporating both spatial factors (such as altitude) and spatio-temporal covariates (such as field temperature, precipitation, etc.). The events are observed in France over a span of three years. Spatio-temporal covariates are observed with resolution $0.1^\circ \times 0.1^\circ$ ($\approx 100$km$^2$) and six-hour periods. This results in an extensive dataset, further characterized by a significant excess of zeroes (i.e., spatio-temporal cells with no observed events). We reexamine composite likelihood methods commonly employed for spatial point processes, especially in situations where covariates are piecewise constant. Additionally, we extend these methods to account for zero-deflated subsampling, a strategy involving dependent subsampling, with a focus on selecting more cells in regions where events are observed. A simulation study is conducted to illustrate these novel methodologies, followed by their application to the dataset of lightning strikes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gridded Transformer Neural Processes for Large Unstructured Spatio-Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06731v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many important problems require modelling large-scale spatio-temporal datasets, with one prevalent example being weather forecasting. Recently, transformer-based approaches have shown great promise in a range of weather forecasting problems. However, these have mostly focused on gridded data sources, neglecting the wealth of unstructured, off-the-grid data from observational measurements such as those at weather stations. A promising family of models suitable for such tasks are neural processes (NPs), notably the family of transformer neural processes (TNPs). Although TNPs have shown promise on small spatio-temporal datasets, they are unable to scale to the quantities of data used by state-of-the-art weather and climate models. This limitation stems from their lack of efficient attention mechanisms. We address this shortcoming through the introduction of gridded pseudo-token TNPs which employ specialised encoders and decoders to handle unstructured observations and utilise a processor containing gridded pseudo-tokens that leverage efficient attention mechanisms. Our method consistently outperforms a range of strong baselines on various synthetic and real-world regression tasks involving large-scale data, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. The real-life experiments are performed on weather data, demonstrating the potential of our approach to bring performance and computational benefits when applied at scale in a weather modelling pipeline.</p></details> |  |
| **[LSTM networks provide efficient cyanobacterial blooms forecasting even with incomplete spatio-temporal data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08237v1)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyanobacteria are the most frequent dominant species of algal blooms in inland waters, threatening ecosystem function and water quality, especially when toxin-producing strains predominate. Enhanced by anthropogenic activities and global warming, cyanobacterial blooms are expected to increase in frequency and global distribution. Early warning systems (EWS) for cyanobacterial blooms development allow timely implementation of management measures, reducing the risks associated to these blooms. In this paper, we propose an effective EWS for cyanobacterial bloom forecasting, which uses 6 years of incomplete high-frequency spatio-temporal data from multiparametric probes, including phycocyanin (PC) fluorescence as a proxy for cyanobacteria. A probe agnostic and replicable method is proposed to pre-process the data and to generate time series specific for cyanobacterial bloom forecasting. Using these pre-processed data, six different non-site/species-specific predictive models were compared including the autoregressive and multivariate versions of Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Long-Term Short-Term (LSTM) neural networks. Results were analyzed for seven forecasting time horizons ranging from 4 to 28 days evaluated with a hybrid system that combined regression metrics (MSE, R2, MAPE) for PC values, classification metrics (Accuracy, F1, Kappa) for a proposed alarm level of 10 ug PC/L, and a forecasting-specific metric to measure prediction improvement over the displaced signal (skill). The multivariate version of LSTM showed the best and most consistent results across all forecasting horizons and metrics, achieving accuracies of up to 90% in predicting the proposed PC alarm level. Additionally, positive skill values indicated its outstanding effectiveness to forecast cyanobacterial blooms from 16 to 28 days in advance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning from Spatio-temporal Correlation for Semi-Supervised LiDAR Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06893v1)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the challenges of the semi-supervised LiDAR segmentation (SSLS) problem, particularly in low-budget scenarios. The two main issues in low-budget SSLS are the poor-quality pseudo-labels for unlabeled data, and the performance drops due to the significant imbalance between ground-truth and pseudo-labels. This imbalance leads to a vicious training cycle. To overcome these challenges, we leverage the spatio-temporal prior by recognizing the substantial overlap between temporally adjacent LiDAR scans. We propose a proximity-based label estimation, which generates highly accurate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data by utilizing semantic consistency with adjacent labeled data. Additionally, we enhance this method by progressively expanding the pseudo-labels from the nearest unlabeled scans, which helps significantly reduce errors linked to dynamic classes. Additionally, we employ a dual-branch structure to mitigate performance degradation caused by data imbalance. Experimental results demonstrate remarkable performance in low-budget settings (i.e., <= 5%) and meaningful improvements in normal budget settings (i.e., 5 - 50%). Finally, our method has achieved new state-of-the-art results on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes in semi-supervised LiDAR segmentation. With only 5% labeled data, it offers competitive results against fully-supervised counterparts. Moreover, it surpasses the performance of the previous state-of-the-art at 100% labeled data (75.2%) using only 20% of labeled data (76.0%) on nuScenes. The code is available on https://github.com/halbielee/PLE.</p></details> |  |

Different from the common penalty-based approach, this work promotes adherence to the underlying physical mechanism that facilitates statistical procedures. The motivating application concerns modeling fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, which is used for characterization of diffusion processes. We propose a physics-encoded regression model for handling spatio-temporally distributed data, which enables principled interpretability, parsimonious computation and efficient estimation by exploiting the structure of solutions of a governing evolution equation. The rate of convergence attaining the minimax optimality is theoretically demonstrated, generalizing the result obtained for the spatial regression. We conduct simulation studies to assess the performance of our proposed estimator and illustrate its usage in the aforementioned real data example.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Model Empowered Spatio-Temporal Forecasting via Physics-Aware Reprogramming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14505v2)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is pivotal in numerous real-world applications, including transportation planning, energy management, and climate monitoring. In this work, we aim to harness the reasoning and generalization abilities of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for more effective spatio-temporal forecasting, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. However, recent studies uncover that PLMs, which are primarily trained on textual data, often falter when tasked with modeling the intricate correlations in numerical time series, thereby limiting their effectiveness in comprehending spatio-temporal data. To bridge the gap, we propose RePST, a physics-aware PLM reprogramming framework tailored for spatio-temporal forecasting. Specifically, we first propose a physics-aware decomposer that adaptively disentangles spatially correlated time series into interpretable sub-components, which facilitates PLM to understand sophisticated spatio-temporal dynamics via a divide-and-conquer strategy. Moreover, we propose a selective discrete reprogramming scheme, which introduces an expanded spatio-temporal vocabulary space to project spatio-temporal series into discrete representations. This scheme minimizes the information loss during reprogramming and enriches the representations derived by PLMs. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed RePST outperforms twelve state-of-the-art baseline methods, particularly in data-scarce scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness and superior generalization capabilities of PLMs for spatio-temporal forecasting.</p></details> |  |

However, multimedia technology for contact interaction is less mature than non-contact multimedia technologies and requires further development. Specialized haptic media technologies, requiring low latency and bitrates, are essential to enable haptic interaction, necessitating haptic information compression. Existing vibrotactile signal compression methods, based on the perceptual model, do not consider the characteristics of fused tactile perception at multiple spatially distributed interaction points. In fact, differences in tactile perceptual importance are not limited to conventional frequency and time domains, but also encompass differences in the spatial locations on the skin unique to tactile perception. For the most frequently used tactile information, vibrotactile texture perception, we have developed a model to predict its perceptual importance at multiple points, based on self-supervised learning and Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network. Current experimental results indicate that this model can effectively predict the perceptual importance of various points in multi-point tactile perception scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at Eurohaptics 2024</p></details> |
| **[Fast spatio-temporally varying coefficient modeling with reluctant interaction selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07229v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatially and temporally varying coefficient (STVC) models are currently attracting attention as a flexible tool to explore the spatio-temporal patterns in regression coefficients. However, these models often struggle with balancing computational efficiency and model flexibility. To address this challenge, this study develops a fast and flexible method for STVC modeling. For enhanced flexibility in modeling, we assume multiple processes in each varying coefficient, including purely spatial, purely temporal, and spatio-temporal interaction processes with or without time cyclicity. While considering multiple processes can be time consuming, we combine a pre-conditioning method with a model selection procedure, inspired by reluctant interaction modeling. This approach allows us to computationally efficiently select and specify the latent space-time structure. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms alternatives in terms of coefficient estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. Finally, we apply the proposed method to crime analysis using a sample size of 279,360, confirming that the proposed method provides reasonable estimates of varying coefficients. The STVC model is implemented in an R package spmoran.</p></details> |  |
| **[Residual-based Attention Physics-informed Neural Networks for Spatio-Temporal Ageing Assessment of Transformers Operated in Renewable Power Plants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06443v2)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers are crucial for reliable and efficient power system operations, particularly in supporting the integration of renewable energy. Effective monitoring of transformer health is critical to maintain grid stability and performance. Thermal insulation ageing is a key transformer failure mode, which is generally tracked by monitoring the hotspot temperature (HST). However, HST measurement is complex, costly, and often estimated from indirect measurements. Existing HST models focus on space-agnostic thermal models, providing worst-case HST estimates. This article introduces a spatio-temporal model for transformer winding temperature and ageing estimation, which leverages physics-based partial differential equations (PDEs) with data-driven Neural Networks (NN) in a Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) configuration to improve prediction accuracy and acquire spatio-temporal resolution. The computational accuracy of the PINN model is improved through the implementation of the Residual-Based Attention (PINN-RBA) scheme that accelerates the PINN model convergence. The PINN-RBA model is benchmarked against self-adaptive attention schemes and classical vanilla PINN configurations. For the first time, PINN based oil temperature predictions are used to estimate spatio-temporal transformer winding temperature values, validated through PDE numerical solution and fiber optic sensor measurements. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal transformer ageing model is inferred, which supports transformer health management decision-making. Results are validated with a distribution transformer operating on a floating photovoltaic power plant.</p></details> | 23 pages, 18 figures |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Machine Learning Model for Mortgage Credit Risk: Default Probabilities and Loan Portfolios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02846v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel machine learning model for credit risk by combining tree-boosting with a latent spatio-temporal Gaussian process model accounting for frailty correlation. This allows for modeling non-linearities and interactions among predictor variables in a flexible data-driven manner and for accounting for spatio-temporal variation that is not explained by observable predictor variables. We also show how estimation and prediction can be done in a computationally efficient manner. In an application to a large U.S. mortgage credit risk data set, we find that both predictive default probabilities for individual loans and predictive loan portfolio loss distributions obtained with our novel approach are more accurate compared to conventional independent linear hazard models and also linear spatio-temporal models. Using interpretability tools for machine learning models, we find that the likely reasons for this outperformance are strong interaction and non-linear effects in the predictor variables and the presence of large spatio-temporal frailty effects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Arges: Spatio-Temporal Transformer for Ulcerative Colitis Severity Assessment in Endoscopy Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00536v1)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate assessment of disease severity from endoscopy videos in ulcerative colitis (UC) is crucial for evaluating drug efficacy in clinical trials. Severity is often measured by the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) and Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS) score. However, expert MES/UCEIS annotation is time-consuming and susceptible to inter-rater variability, factors addressable by automation. Automation attempts with frame-level labels face challenges in fully-supervised solutions due to the prevalence of video-level labels in clinical trials. CNN-based weakly-supervised models (WSL) with end-to-end (e2e) training lack generalization to new disease scores and ignore spatio-temporal information crucial for accurate scoring. To address these limitations, we propose "Arges", a deep learning framework that utilizes a transformer with positional encoding to incorporate spatio-temporal information from frame features to estimate disease severity scores in endoscopy video. Extracted features are derived from a foundation model (ArgesFM), pre-trained on a large diverse dataset from multiple clinical trials (61M frames, 3927 videos). We evaluate four UC disease severity scores, including MES and three UCEIS component scores. Test set evaluation indicates significant improvements, with F1 scores increasing by 4.1% for MES and 18.8%, 6.6%, 3.8% for the three UCEIS component scores compared to state-of-the-art methods. Prospective validation on previously unseen clinical trial data further demonstrates the model's successful generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables, accepted at MLMI, MICCAI</p></details> |
| **[Towards Unifying Diffusion Models for Probabilistic Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17360v2)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal graph learning is a fundamental problem in modern urban systems. Existing approaches tackle different tasks independently, tailoring their models to unique task characteristics. These methods, however, fall short of modeling intrinsic uncertainties in the spatio-temporal data. Meanwhile, their specialized designs misalign with the current research efforts toward unifying spatio-temporal graph learning solutions. In this paper, we propose to model these tasks in a unified probabilistic perspective, viewing them as predictions based on conditional information with shared dependencies. Based on this proposal, we introduce Unified Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Models (USTD) to address the tasks uniformly under the uncertainty-aware diffusion framework. USTD is holistically designed, comprising a shared spatio-temporal encoder and attention-based denoising decoders that are task-specific. The encoder, optimized by pre-training strategies, effectively captures conditional spatio-temporal patterns. The decoders, utilizing attention mechanisms, generate predictions by leveraging learned patterns. Opting for forecasting and kriging, the decoders are designed as Spatial Gated Attention (SGA) and Temporal Gated Attention (TGA) for each task, with different emphases on the spatial and temporal dimensions. Combining the advantages of deterministic encoders and probabilistic decoders, USTD achieves state-of-the-art performances compared to both deterministic and probabilistic baselines, while also providing valuable uncertainty estimates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Deciphering and Inpainting in Spatio-Temporal Dynamics via Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19608v1)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal (ST) prediction has garnered a De facto attention in earth sciences, such as meteorological prediction, human mobility perception. However, the scarcity of data coupled with the high expenses involved in sensor deployment results in notable data imbalances. Furthermore, models that are excessively customized and devoid of causal connections further undermine the generalizability and interpretability. To this end, we establish a causal framework for ST predictions, termed CaPaint, which targets to identify causal regions in data and endow model with causal reasoning ability in a two-stage process. Going beyond this process, we utilize the back-door adjustment to specifically address the sub-regions identified as non-causal in the upstream phase. Specifically, we employ a novel image inpainting technique. By using a fine-tuned unconditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as the generative prior, we in-fill the masks defined as environmental parts, offering the possibility of reliable extrapolation for potential data distributions. CaPaint overcomes the high complexity dilemma of optimal ST causal discovery models by reducing the data generation complexity from exponential to quasi-linear levels. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world ST benchmarks demonstrate that integrating the CaPaint concept allows models to achieve improvements ranging from 4.3% to 77.3%. Moreover, compared to traditional mainstream ST augmenters, CaPaint underscores the potential of diffusion models in ST enhancement, offering a novel paradigm for this field.

Our proposed method applies DETR to each frame and uses feature shift to incorporate temporal information. However, DETR's object queries in each frame may correspond to different objects, making a simple feature shift ineffective. To overcome this issue, we propose query matching across different frames, ensuring that queries for the same object are matched and used for the feature shift. Experimental results show that performance on the JHMDB21 dataset improves significantly when query features are shifted using the proposed query matching.</p></details> |  |

The complexity of the underlying systems often makes finding the optimal decision challenging, especially when the safety-critical system is time-varying. Overcoming the problem of optimizing an unknown time-varying reward subject to unknown time-varying safety constraints, we propose TVSafeOpt, a new algorithm built on Bayesian optimization with a spatio-temporal kernel. The algorithm is capable of safely tracking a time-varying safe region without the need for explicit change detection. Optimality guarantees are also provided for the algorithm when the optimization problem becomes stationary. We show that TVSafeOpt compares favorably against SafeOpt on synthetic data, both regarding safety and optimality. Evaluation on a realistic case study with gas compressors confirms that TVSafeOpt ensures safety when solving time-varying optimization problems with unknown reward and safety functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Existing RGB-E tracking methods model event characteristics utilising attention mechanism of Transformer before integrating both modalities. Nevertheless, these methods involve aggregating the event stream into a single event frame, lacking the utilisation of the temporal information inherent in the event stream.Moreover, the traditional attention mechanism is well-suited for dense semantic features, while the attention mechanism for sparse event features require revolution. In this paper, we propose a dynamic event subframe splitting strategy to split the event stream into more fine-grained event clusters, aiming to capture spatio-temporal features that contain motion cues. Based on this, we design an event-based sparse attention mechanism to enhance the interaction of event features in temporal and spatial dimensions. The experimental results indicate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the FE240 and COESOT datasets, providing an effective processing manner for the event data.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, conference</p></details> |

This paper introduces SEA-ViT, an advanced deep learning model that integrates Vision Transformer (ViT) with bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to capture spatio-temporal covariance for predicting sea surface currents (U, V) using high-frequency radar (HF) data. The name SEA-ViT is derived from ``Sea Surface Currents Forecasting using Vision Transformer,'' highlighting the model's emphasis on ocean dynamics and its use of the ViT architecture to enhance forecasting capabilities. SEA-ViT is designed to unravel complex dependencies by leveraging a rich dataset spanning over 30 years and incorporating ENSO indices (El Ni\~no, La Ni\~na, and neutral phases) to address the intricate relationship between geographic coordinates and climatic variations. This development enhances the predictive capabilities for sea surface currents, supporting the efforts of the Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (GISTDA) in Thailand's maritime regions.

| **[AutoSTF: Decoupled Neural Architecture Search for Cost-Effective Automated Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16586v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is a critical component of various smart city applications, such as transportation optimization, energy management, and socio-economic analysis. Recently, several automated spatio-temporal forecasting methods have been proposed to automatically search the optimal neural network architecture for capturing complex spatio-temporal dependencies. However, the existing automated approaches suffer from expensive neural architecture search overhead, which hinders their practical use and the further exploration of diverse spatio-temporal operators in a finer granularity. In this paper, we propose AutoSTF, a decoupled automatic neural architecture search framework for cost-effective automated spatio-temporal forecasting. From the efficiency perspective, we first decouple the mixed search space into temporal space and spatial space and respectively devise representation compression and parameter-sharing schemes to mitigate the parameter explosion. The decoupled spatio-temporal search not only expedites the model optimization process but also leaves new room for more effective spatio-temporal dependency modeling. From the effectiveness perspective, we propose a multi-patch transfer module to jointly capture multi-granularity temporal dependencies and extend the spatial search space to enable finer-grained layer-wise spatial dependency search. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the superiority of AutoSTF in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, our proposed method achieves up to 13.48x speed-up compared to state-of-the-art automatic spatio-temporal forecasting methods while maintaining the best forecasting accuracy.</p></details> | 16 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Automated Spatio-Temporal Weather Modeling for Load Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16326v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electricity is difficult to store, except at prohibitive cost, and therefore the balance between generation and load must be maintained at all times. Electricity is traditionally managed by anticipating demand and intermittent production (wind, solar) and matching flexible production (hydro, nuclear, coal and gas). Accurate forecasting of electricity load and renewable production is therefore essential to ensure grid performance and stability. Both are highly dependent on meteorological variables (temperature, wind, sunshine). These dependencies are complex and difficult to model. On the one hand, spatial variations do not have a uniform impact because population, industry, and wind and solar farms are not evenly distributed across the territory. On the other hand, temporal variations can have delayed effects on load (due to the thermal inertia of buildings). With access to observations from different weather stations and simulated data from meteorological models, we believe that both phenomena can be modeled together. In today's state-of-the-art load forecasting models, the spatio-temporal modeling of the weather is fixed. In this work, we aim to take advantage of the automated representation and spatio-temporal feature extraction capabilities of deep neural networks to improve spatio-temporal weather modeling for load forecasting. We compare our deep learning-based methodology with the state-of-the-art on French national load. This methodology could also be fully adapted to forecasting renewable energy production.</p></details> |  |

Our approach, namely spatio-temporal motion retargeting (STMR), guides imitation learning procedures by transferring motion from source to target, effectively bridging the morphological disparities by ensuring the feasibility of imitation on the target system. Our STMR method comprises two components: spatial motion retargeting (SMR) and temporal motion retargeting (TMR). On the one hand, SMR tackles motion retargeting at the kinematic level by generating kinematically feasible whole-body motions from keypoint trajectories. On the other hand, TMR aims to retarget motion at the dynamic level by optimizing motion in the temporal domain. We showcase the effectiveness of our method in facilitating Imitation Learning (IL) for complex animal movements through a series of simulation and hardware experiments. In these experiments, our STMR method successfully tailored complex animal motions from various media, including video captured by a hand-held camera, to fit the morphology and physical properties of the target robots. This enabled RL policy training for precise motion tracking, while baseline methods struggled with highly dynamic motion involving flying phases. Moreover, we validated that the control policy can successfully imitate six different motions in two quadruped robots with different dimensions and physical properties in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 7 figures, videos available at https://terry97-guel.github.io/STMR-RL.github.io/</p></details> |

Traditional rPPG models often struggle with poor generalization capacity in unseen domains. Current solutions to this problem is to improve its generalization in the target domain through Domain Generalization (DG) or Domain Adaptation (DA). However, both traditional methods require access to both source domain data and target domain data, which cannot be implemented in scenarios with limited access to source data, and another issue is the privacy of accessing source domain data. In this paper, we propose the first Source-free Domain Adaptation benchmark for rPPG measurement (SFDA-rPPG), which overcomes these limitations by enabling effective domain adaptation without access to source domain data. Our framework incorporates a Three-Branch Spatio-Temporal Consistency Network (TSTC-Net) to enhance feature consistency across domains. Furthermore, we propose a new rPPG distribution alignment loss based on the Frequency-domain Wasserstein Distance (FWD), which leverages optimal transport to align power spectrum distributions across domains effectively and further enforces the alignment of the three branches. Extensive cross-domain experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in source-free domain adaptation settings. Our findings highlight the significant contribution of the proposed FWD loss for distributional alignment, providing a valuable reference for future research and applications.

| **[EventAug: Multifaceted Spatio-Temporal Data Augmentation Methods for Event-based Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11813v1)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The event camera has demonstrated significant success across a wide range of areas due to its low time latency and high dynamic range. However, the community faces challenges such as data deficiency and limited diversity, often resulting in over-fitting and inadequate feature learning. Notably, the exploration of data augmentation techniques in the event community remains scarce. This work aims to address this gap by introducing a systematic augmentation scheme named EventAug to enrich spatial-temporal diversity. In particular, we first propose Multi-scale Temporal Integration (MSTI) to diversify the motion speed of objects, then introduce Spatial-salient Event Mask (SSEM) and Temporal-salient Event Mask (TSEM) to enrich object variants. Our EventAug can facilitate models learning with richer motion patterns, object variants and local spatio-temporal relations, thus improving model robustness to varied moving speeds, occlusions, and action disruptions. Experiment results show that our augmentation method consistently yields significant improvements across different tasks and backbones (e.g., a 4.87% accuracy gain on DVS128 Gesture). Our code will be publicly available for this community.</p></details> |  |

The proposed model can simplify the parameterization by using network structure in data, and can capture the asymmetric property in dynamic volatility by adopting a threshold structure. The proposed model assumes the conditional distribution is Poisson distribution. Asymptotic theory of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for the spatial model is derived when both sample size and network dimension are large. We obtain asymptotic statistical inferences via investigation of the weak dependence of components of the model and application of limit theorems for weakly dependent random fields. Simulation studies and a real data example are presented to support our methodology.</p></details> |  |

Current MOT trackers rely on accurate object detection results and precise matching of target reidentification (ReID). These methods focus on optimizing target spatial attributes while overlooking temporal cues in modelling object relationships, especially for challenging tracking conditions such as object deformation and blurring, etc. To address the above-mentioned issues, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Cohesion Multiple Object Tracking framework (STCMOT), which utilizes historical embedding features to model the representation of ReID and detection features in a sequential order. Concretely, a temporal embedding boosting module is introduced to enhance the discriminability of individual embedding based on adjacent frame cooperation. While the trajectory embedding is then propagated by a temporal detection refinement module to mine salient target locations in the temporal field. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone2019 and UAVDT datasets demonstrate our STCMOT sets a new state-of-the-art performance in MOTA and IDF1 metrics.

| **[Spatio-Temporal-Network Point Processes for Modeling Crime Events with Landmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10882v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-exciting point processes are widely used to model the contagious effects of crime events living within continuous geographic space, using their occurrence time and locations. However, in urban environments, most events are naturally constrained within the city's street network structure, and the contagious effects of crime are governed by such a network geography. Meanwhile, the complex distribution of urban infrastructures also plays an important role in shaping crime patterns across space. We introduce a novel spatio-temporal-network point process framework for crime modeling that integrates these urban environmental characteristics by incorporating self-attention graph neural networks. Our framework incorporates the street network structure as the underlying event space, where crime events can occur at random locations on the network edges. To realistically capture criminal movement patterns, distances between events are measured using street network distances. We then propose a new mark for a crime event by concatenating the event's crime category with the type of its nearby landmark, aiming to capture how the urban design influences the mixing structures of various crime types. A graph attention network architecture is adopted to learn the existence of mark-to-mark interactions. Extensive experiments on crime data from Valencia, Spain, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in understanding the crime landscape and forecasting crime risks across regions.</p></details> |  |

While limiting the variety of training data can make training easier, it can also lead to a lack of knowledge and information for the model, resulting in a decrease in performance. To address this challenge, we presented an innovative paradigm that incorporates three separate forms of curriculum learning specifically targeting from spatial, temporal, and quantile perspectives. Furthermore, our framework incorporates a stacking fusion module to combine diverse information from three types of curriculum learning, resulting in a strong and thorough learning process.

| **[Disentangling spatio-temporal knowledge for weakly supervised object detection and segmentation in surgical video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15794v3)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised video object segmentation (WSVOS) enables the identification of segmentation maps without requiring an extensive training dataset of object masks, relying instead on coarse video labels indicating object presence. Current state-of-the-art methods either require multiple independent stages of processing that employ motion cues or, in the case of end-to-end trainable networks, lack in segmentation accuracy, in part due to the difficulty of learning segmentation maps from videos with transient object presence. This limits the application of WSVOS for semantic annotation of surgical videos where multiple surgical tools frequently move in and out of the field of view, a problem that is more difficult than typically encountered in WSVOS. This paper introduces Video Spatio-Temporal Disentanglement Networks (VDST-Net), a framework to disentangle spatiotemporal information using semi-decoupled knowledge distillation to predict high-quality class activation maps (CAMs). A teacher network designed to resolve temporal conflicts when specifics about object location and timing in the video are not provided works with a student network that integrates information over time by leveraging temporal dependencies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on a public reference dataset and on a more challenging surgical video dataset where objects are, on average, present in less than 60\% of annotated frames. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and generates superior segmentation masks under video-level weak supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Specifically, we consider the global task as a conjunction of independent and collaborative tasks, defined over the absolute and relative states of agent pairs. Task dependencies in this form are then represented by a task graph, which we assume to be acyclic. From the given task graph, we provide an algorithmic approach to define a distributed sampled-data controller prioritizing the fulfilment of collaborative tasks as the primary objective, while fulfilling independent tasks unless they conflict with collaborative ones. Moreover, communication maintenance among collaborating agents is seamlessly enforced within the proposed control framework. A numerical simulation is provided to showcase the potential of our control framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Short...</summary><p>Short version of this paper was accepted for the Conference on Decision and Control.

However, scalability and generalization challenges remain significant obstacles. Advanced models often rely on Graph Neural Networks to encode spatial and temporal correlations, but struggle with the increased complexity of large-scale datasets. The recursive GNN-based message passing schemes used in these models hinder their training and deployment in real-life urban sensing scenarios. Moreover, long-spanning large-scale spatio-temporal data introduce distribution shifts, necessitating improved generalization performance. To address these challenges, we propose a simple framework for spatio-temporal prediction - EasyST paradigm. It learns lightweight and robust Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) by effectively distilling knowledge from complex spatio-temporal GNNs. We ensure robust knowledge distillation by integrating the spatio-temporal information bottleneck with teacher-bounded regression loss, filtering out task-irrelevant noise and avoiding erroneous guidance. We further enhance the generalization ability of the student model by incorporating spatial and temporal prompts to provide downstream task contexts. Evaluation on three spatio-temporal datasets for urban computing tasks demonstrates that EasyST surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in terms of efficiency and accuracy. The implementation code is available at: https://github.com/HKUDS/EasyST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM'2024, full paper</p></details> |
| **[A general reduced-order neural operator for spatio-temporal predictive learning on complex spatial domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05508v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive learning for spatio-temporal processes (PL-STP) on complex spatial domains plays a critical role in various scientific and engineering fields, with its essence being the construction of operators between infinite-dimensional function spaces. This paper focuses on the unequal-domain mappings in PL-STP and categorising them into increase-domain and decrease-domain mapping. Recent advances in deep learning have revealed the great potential of neural operators (NOs) to learn operators directly from observational data. However, existing NOs require input space and output space to be the same domain, which pose challenges in ensuring predictive accuracy and stability for unequal-domain mappings. To this end, this study presents a general reduced-order neural operator named Reduced-Order Neural Operator on Riemannian Manifolds (RO-NORM), which consists of two parts: the unequal-domain encoder/decoder and the same-domain approximator. Motivated by the variable separation in classical modal decomposition, the unequal-domain encoder/decoder uses the pre-computed bases to reformulate the spatio-temporal function as a sum of products between spatial (or temporal) bases and corresponding temporally (or spatially) distributed weight functions, thus the original unequal-domain mapping can be converted into a same-domain mapping. Consequently, the same-domain approximator NORM is applied to model the transformed mapping. The performance of our proposed method has been evaluated on six benchmark cases, including parametric PDEs, engineering and biomedical applications, and compared with four baseline algorithms: DeepONet, POD-DeepONet, PCA-Net, and vanilla NORM. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of RO-NORM in prediction accuracy and training efficiency for PL-STP.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Attention-Based Method for Detecting Student Classroom Behaviors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02523v4)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately detecting student behavior from classroom videos is beneficial for analyzing their classroom status and improving teaching efficiency. However, low accuracy in student classroom behavior detection is a prevalent issue. To address this issue, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Attention-Based Method for Detecting Student Classroom Behaviors (BDSTA). Firstly, the SlowFast network is used to generate motion and environmental information feature maps from the video. Then, the spatio-temporal attention module is applied to the feature maps, including information aggregation, compression and stimulation processes. Subsequently, attention maps in the time, channel and space dimensions are obtained, and multi-label behavior classification is performed based on these attention maps. To solve the long-tail data problem that exists in student classroom behavior datasets, we use an improved focal loss function to assign more weight to the tail class data during training. Experimental results are conducted on a self-made student classroom behavior dataset named STSCB. Compared with the SlowFast model, the average accuracy of student behavior classification detection improves by 8.94\% using BDSTA.</p></details> |  |

However, the lack of publicly available spatio-temporal datasets on student behavior, as well as the high cost of manually labeling such datasets, pose significant challenges for researchers in this field. To address this issue, we proposed a method for extending the spatio-temporal behavior dataset in Student Classroom Scenarios (SCB-ST-Dataset4) through image dataset. Our SCB-ST-Dataset4 comprises 757265 images with 25810 labels, focusing on 3 behaviors: hand-raising, reading, writing. Our proposed method can rapidly generate spatio-temporal behavior datasets without requiring extra manual labeling. Furthermore, we proposed a Behavior Similarity Index (BSI) to explore the similarity of behaviors. We evaluated the dataset using the YOLOv5, YOLOv7, YOLOv8, and SlowFast algorithms, achieving a mean average precision (map) of up to 82.3%. Last, we fused multiple models to generate student behavior-related data from various perspectives. The experiment further demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. And SCB-ST-Dataset4 provides a robust foundation for future research in student behavior detection, potentially contributing to advancements in this field. The SCB-ST-Dataset4 is available for download at: https://github.com/Whiffe/SCB-dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2310.02522; text overlap with arXiv:2306.03318</p></details> |

Developing techniques to identify and analyze communities in these time-varying graph structures is an important challenge. In this work, we generalize existing spectral clustering algorithms from static to dynamic graphs using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to capture the temporal evolution of clusters. Based on this extended canonical correlation framework, we define the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian and investigate its spectral properties. We connect these concepts to dynamical systems theory via transfer operators, and illustrate the advantages of our method on benchmark graphs by comparison with existing methods. We show that the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian allows for a clear interpretation of cluster structure evolution over time for directed and undirected graphs.</p></details> |  |

A critical component of disease behavior is the velocity with which disease spreads, defined as the rate of change between time and space. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal modeling approach to determine the velocities of infectious disease spread. Our approach assumes that the locations and times of people infected can be considered as a spatio-temporal point pattern that arises as a realization of a spatio-temporal log-Gaussian Cox process. The intensity of this process is estimated using fast Bayesian inference by employing the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) and the Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE) approaches. The velocity is then calculated using finite differences that approximate the derivatives of the intensity function. Finally, the directions and magnitudes of the velocities can be mapped at specific times to examine better the spread of the disease throughout the region. We demonstrate our method by analyzing COVID-19 spread in Cali, Colombia, during the 2020-2021 pandemic.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 46 figures, Journal American Statistican, submitted on 3rd of September</p></details> |

A video tutorial for this library is available on YouTube. We consider two types of methods to estimate a non-homogeneous Poisson process in space and time. The methods approximate the arrival intensity function of the Poisson process by discretizing space and time, and estimating arrival intensity as a function of subregion and time interval. With such methods, it is typical that the dimension of the estimator is large relative to the amount of data, and therefore the performance of the estimator can be improved by using additional data. The first method uses additional data to add a regularization term to the likelihood function for calibrating the intensity of the Poisson process. The second method uses additional data to estimate arrival intensity as a function of covariates. We describe a Python package to perform various types of space and time discretization. We also describe two packages for the calibration of the models, one in Matlab and one in C++. We demonstrate the advantages of our methods compared to basic maximum likelihood estimation with simulated and real data. The experiments with real data calibrate models of the arrival process of emergencies to be handled by the Rio de Janeiro emergency medical service.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the forecasting models have employed multi-source data as the multi-modality input, thus improving the prediction accuracy. However, the prevailing methods usually suffer from the desynchronization of multi-source variables, the insufficient capability of capturing spatio-temporal dependency, and unsatisfactory performance in predicting extreme precipitation events. To fix these problems, we propose a short-term precipitation forecasting model based on spatio-temporal alignment attention, with SATA as the temporal alignment module and STAU as the spatio-temporal feature extractor to filter high-pass features from precipitation signals and capture multi-term temporal dependencies. Based on satellite and ERA5 data from the southwestern region of China, our model achieves improvements of 12.61\% in terms of RMSE, in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modelling multivariate spatio-temporal data with identifiable variational autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04162v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modelling multivariate spatio-temporal data with complex dependency structures is a challenging task but can be simplified by assuming that the original variables are generated from independent latent components. If these components are found, they can be modelled univariately. Blind source separation aims to recover the latent components by estimating the unmixing transformation based on the observed data only. The current methods for spatio-temporal blind source separation are restricted to linear unmixing, and nonlinear variants have not been implemented. In this paper, we extend identifiable variational autoencoder to the nonlinear nonstationary spatio-temporal blind source separation setting and demonstrate its performance using comprehensive simulation studies. Additionally, we introduce two alternative methods for the latent dimension estimation, which is a crucial task in order to obtain the correct latent representation. Finally, we illustrate the proposed methods using a meteorological application, where we estimate the latent dimension and the latent components, interpret the components, and show how nonstationarity can be accounted and prediction accuracy can be improved by using the proposed nonlinear blind source separation method as a preprocessing method.</p></details> |  |

Designing spatio-temporal forecasting models separately in a task-wise and city-wise manner to forecast demand and supply-demand gap in a ride-hailing system poses a burden for the expanding transportation network companies. Therefore, a multi-task learning architecture is proposed in this study by developing gated ensemble of spatio-temporal mixture of experts network (GESME-Net) with convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and recurrent neural network (RNN) for simultaneously forecasting these spatio-temporal tasks in a city as well as across different cities. Furthermore, a task adaptation layer is integrated with the architecture for learning joint representation in multi-task learning and revealing the contribution of the input features utilized in prediction. The proposed architecture is tested with data from Didi Chuxing for: (i) simultaneously forecasting demand and supply-demand gap in Beijing, and (ii) simultaneously forecasting demand across Chengdu and Xian. In both scenarios, models from our proposed architecture outperformed the single-task and multi-task deep learning benchmarks and ensemble-based machine learning algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2012.08868</p></details> |

Although adopting a surrogate gradient (SG) makes the non-differentiability SNN trainable, achieving comparable accuracy for ANNs and keeping low-power features simultaneously is still tricky. In this paper, we proposed an energy-efficient spike-train level spiking neural network with spatio-temporal conversion, which has low computational cost and high accuracy. In the STCSNN, spatio-temporal conversion blocks (STCBs) are proposed to keep the low power features of SNNs and improve accuracy. However, STCSNN cannot adopt backpropagation algorithms directly due to the non-differentiability nature of spike trains. We proposed a suitable learning rule for STCSNNs by deducing the equivalent gradient of STCB. We evaluate the proposed STCSNN on static and neuromorphic datasets, including Fashion-Mnist, Cifar10, Cifar100, TinyImageNet, and DVS-Cifar10. The experiment results show that our proposed STCSNN outperforms the state-of-the-art accuracy on nearly all datasets, using fewer time steps and being highly energy-efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neurocomputing on 10 August 2024</p></details> |

It consists of a pyramid structure with a spatial information reuse strategy, a sequential pose initialization module, a gated hierarchical pose refinement module, and a temporal feature propagation module. First, spatial features are encoded using a point feature pyramid, with features reused in successive pose estimations to reduce computational overhead. Second, a sequential pose initialization method is introduced, leveraging the high-frequency sampling characteristic of LiDAR to initialize the LiDAR pose. Then, a gated hierarchical pose refinement mechanism refines poses from coarse to fine by selectively retaining or discarding motion information from different layers based on gate estimations. Finally, temporal feature propagation is proposed to incorporate the historical motion information from point cloud sequences, and address the spatial inconsistency issue when transmitting motion information embedded in point clouds between frames. Experimental results on the KITTI odometry dataset and Argoverse dataset demonstrate that DSLO outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving at least a 15.67\% improvement on RTE and a 12.64\% improvement on RRE, while also achieving a 34.69\% reduction in runtime compared to baseline methods.

However, existing methods encounter difficulties when applied to problems on unstructured grids and irregular domains. Spatial graph neural networks utilize local convolution in a neighborhood to potentially address these challenges, yet they often suffer from issues such as over-smoothing and over-squashing in deep architectures. Conversely, spectral graph neural networks leverage global convolution to capture extensive features and long-range dependencies in domain graphs, albeit at a high computational cost due to Eigenvalue decomposition. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, referred to as Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Operator (Sp$^2$GNO) that integrates spatial and spectral GNNs effectively. This framework mitigates the limitations of individual methods and enables the learning of solution operators across arbitrary geometries, thus catering to a wide range of real-world problems. Sp$^2$GNO demonstrates exceptional performance in solving both time-dependent and time-independent partial differential equations on regular and irregular domains. Our approach is validated through comprehensive benchmarks and practical applications drawn from computational mechanics and scientific computing literature.</p></details> |  |

These hybrid models typically arrange the spatial and temporal learning components in series. A pioneering effort to jointly model the spatio-temporal dependencies using only GNNs was the introduction of the Block Adjacency Matrix \(\mathbf{A_B}\) \cite{1}, which was constructed by diagonally concatenating adjacency matrices from graphs at different time steps. This approach resulted in a single graph encompassing complete spatio-temporal data; however, the graphs from different time steps remained disconnected, limiting GNN message-passing to spatially connected nodes only. Addressing this critical challenge, we propose a novel end-to-end learning architecture specifically designed to mend the temporal dependencies, resulting in a well-connected graph. Thus, we provide a framework for the learnable representation of spatio-temporal data as graphs. Our methodology demonstrates superior performance on benchmark datasets, such as SurgVisDom and C2D2, surpassing existing state-of-the-art graph models in terms of accuracy. Our model also achieves significantly lower computational complexity, having far fewer parameters than methods reliant on CLIP and 3D CNN architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICONIP 2024</p></details> |

However, these networks often face challenges in training due to the high annotation cost. To address this, unsupervised and weakly-supervised methods have been developed to reduce the dependency on annotations. This work introduces a novel weakly-supervised method called Eigen-cluster VIS that, without requiring any mask annotations, achieves competitive accuracy compared to other VIS approaches. This method is based on two key innovations: a Temporal Eigenvalue Loss (TEL) and a clip-level Quality Cluster Coefficient (QCC). The TEL ensures temporal coherence by leveraging the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix derived from graph adjacency matrices. By minimizing the mean absolute error (MAE) between the eigenvalues of adjacent frames, this loss function promotes smooth transitions and stable segmentation boundaries over time, reducing temporal discontinuities and improving overall segmentation quality. The QCC employs the K-means method to ensure the quality of spatio-temporal clusters without relying on ground truth masks. Using the Davies-Bouldin score, the QCC provides an unsupervised measure of feature discrimination, allowing the model to self-evaluate and adapt to varying object distributions, enhancing robustness during the testing phase. These enhancements are computationally efficient and straightforward, offering significant performance gains without additional annotated data. The proposed Eigen-Cluster VIS method is evaluated on the YouTube-VIS 2019/2021 and OVIS datasets, demonstrating that it effectively narrows the performance gap between the fully-supervised and weakly-supervised VIS approaches.

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at modeling and forecasting spatio-temporal data, they often lack the ability to directly incorporate underlying physical laws. This work presents TG-PhyNN, a novel Temporal Graph Physics-Informed Neural Network framework. TG-PhyNN leverages the power of GNNs for graph-based modeling while simultaneously incorporating physical constraints as a guiding principle during training. This is achieved through a two-step prediction strategy that enables the calculation of physical equation derivatives within the GNN architecture. Our findings demonstrate that TG-PhyNN significantly outperforms traditional forecasting models (e.g., GRU, LSTM, GAT) on real-world spatio-temporal datasets like PedalMe (traffic flow), COVID-19 spread, and Chickenpox outbreaks. These datasets are all governed by well-defined physical principles, which TG-PhyNN effectively exploits to offer more reliable and accurate forecasts in various domains where physical processes govern the dynamics of data. This paves the way for improved forecasting in areas like traffic flow prediction, disease outbreak prediction, and potentially other fields where physics plays a crucial role.</p></details> |  |

Recent works aim to enhance this process by incorporating interaction modeling, which captures the relationship between people and their surrounding context. However, these approaches have primarily focused on fully-supervised learning, and the current limitation lies in the lack of generalization capability to recognize unseen action categories. In this paper, we aim to adapt the pretrained image-language models to detect unseen actions. To this end, we propose a method which can effectively leverage the rich knowledge of visual-language models to perform Person-Context Interaction. Meanwhile, our Context Prompting module will utilize contextual information to prompt labels, thereby enhancing the generation of more representative text features. Moreover, to address the challenge of recognizing distinct actions by multiple people at the same timestamp, we design the Interest Token Spotting mechanism which employs pretrained visual knowledge to find each person's interest context tokens, and then these tokens will be used for prompting to generate text features tailored to each individual. To evaluate the ability to detect unseen actions, we propose a comprehensive benchmark on J-HMDB, UCF101-24, and AVA datasets. The experiments show that our method achieves superior results compared to previous approaches and can be further extended to multi-action videos, bringing it closer to real-world applications.

A reason for this is that learning on dynamic graph data is becoming more relevant, since data from many scientific fields, ranging from mathematics, biology, social sciences, and physics to computer science, is naturally related and inherently dynamic. In addition, TPPs provide a meaningful characterization of event streams and a prediction mechanism for future events. Therefore, (semi-)parameterized Neural TPPs have been introduced whose characterization can be (partially) learned and, thus, enable the representation of more complex phenomena. However, the research on modeling dynamic graphs with TPPs is relatively young, and only a few models for node attribute changes or evolving edges have been proposed yet. To allow for learning on fully dynamic graph streams, i.e., graphs that can change in their structure (addition/deletion of nodes/edge) and in their node/edge attributes, we propose a Marked Neural Spatio-Temporal Point Process (MNSTPP). It leverages a Dynamic Graph Neural Network to learn a Marked TPP that handles attributes and spatial data to model and predict any event in a graph stream.</p></details> |  |

Human-centric VAD, a specialized area within this domain, faces additional complexities, including variations in human behavior, potential biases in data, and substantial privacy concerns related to human subjects. These issues complicate the development of models that are both robust and generalizable. To address these challenges, recent advancements have focused on pose-based VAD, which leverages human pose as a high-level feature to mitigate privacy concerns, reduce appearance biases, and minimize background interference. In this paper, we introduce PoseWatch, a novel transformer-based architecture designed specifically for human-centric pose-based VAD. PoseWatch features an innovative Spatio-Temporal Pose and Relative Pose (ST-PRP) tokenization method that enhances the representation of human motion over time, which is also beneficial for broader human behavior analysis tasks. The architecture's core, a Unified Encoder Twin Decoders (UETD) transformer, significantly improves the detection of anomalous behaviors in video data. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PoseWatch consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in pose-based VAD. This work not only demonstrates the efficacy of PoseWatch but also highlights the potential of integrating Natural Language Processing techniques with computer vision to advance human behavior analysis.</p></details> |  |

Traditional forecasting methods, however, struggle with the irregular traffic time series resulting from adaptive traffic signal controls, presenting challenges in asynchronous spatial dependency, irregular temporal dependency, and predicting variable-length sequences. To this end, we propose an Asynchronous Spatio-tEmporal graph convolutional nEtwoRk (ASeer) tailored for irregular traffic time series forecasting. Specifically, we first propose an Asynchronous Graph Diffusion Network to capture the spatial dependency between asynchronously measured traffic states regulated by adaptive traffic signals. After that, to capture the temporal dependency within irregular traffic state sequences, a personalized time encoding is devised to embed the continuous time signals. Then, we propose a Transformable Time-aware Convolution Network, which adapts meta-filters for time-aware convolution on the sequences with inconsistent temporal flow. Additionally, a Semi-Autoregressive Prediction Network, comprising a state evolution unit and a semi-autoregressive predictor, is designed to predict variable-length traffic sequences effectively and efficiently.

The associated challenges are exacerbated when solutions to these interconnected problems need to simultaneously maximize task performance and respect practical constraints on time and resources. In this work, we formulate a new class of spatio-temporal heterogeneous task allocation problems that formalize these complexities. We then contribute a novel framework, named Quality-Optimized Incremental Task Allocation Graph Search (Q-ITAGS), to solve such problems. Q-ITAGS offers a flexible interleaved framework that i) explicitly models and optimizes the effect of collective capabilities on task performance via learnable trait-quality maps, and ii) respects both resource and spatio-temporal constraints, including a user-specified time budget (i.e., maximum makespan). In addition to algorithmic contributions, we derive theoretical suboptimality bounds in terms of task performance that varies as a function of a single hyperparameter. Detailed experiments involving a simulated emergency response task and a real-world video game dataset reveal that i) Q-ITAGS results in superior team performance compared to a state-of-the-art method, while also respecting complex spatio-temporal and resource constraints, ii) Q-ITAGS efficiently learns trait-quality maps to enable effective trade-off between task performance and resource constraints, and iii) Q-ITAGS' suboptimality bounds consistently hold in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.13092</p></details> |

However, existing methods are limited by their ability to handle large, complex datasets. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of open-source large and small-scale language models (LLMs and LMs) with traditional forecasting methods. We augment traditional methods with dynamic prompting and a grouped-query, multi-head attention mechanism to more effectively capture both intra-series and inter-series dependencies in evolving nonlinear time series data. In addition, we facilitate on-premises customization by fine-tuning smaller open-source LMs for time series trend analysis utilizing descriptions generated by open-source large LMs on consumer-grade hardware using Low-Rank Adaptation with Activation Memory Reduction (LoRA-AMR) technique to reduce computational overhead and activation storage memory demands while preserving inference latency. We combine language model processing for time series trend analysis with traditional time series representation learning method for cross-modal integration, achieving robust and accurate forecasts. The framework effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experiments on various real-world datasets, outperforming existing methods by significant margins in terms of forecast accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper published at the Deployable AI (DAI) workshop at AAAI-2024</p></details> |

Although various neural networks with intricate architectures have been developed to address this problem, they still face two key challenges: i) Recent advancements in network designs for modeling spatio-temporal correlations are starting to see diminishing returns in performance enhancements. ii) Additionally, most models do not account for the spatio-temporal heterogeneity inherent in traffic data, i.e., traffic distribution varies significantly across different regions and traffic flow patterns fluctuate across various time slots. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer (STGormer), which effectively integrates attribute and structure information inherent in traffic data for learning spatio-temporal correlations, and a mixture-of-experts module for capturing heterogeneity along spaital and temporal axes. Specifically, we design two straightforward yet effective spatial encoding methods based on the graph structure and integrate time position encoding into the vanilla transformer to capture spatio-temporal traffic patterns. Additionally, a mixture-of-experts enhanced feedforward neural network (FNN) module adaptively assigns suitable expert layers to distinct patterns via a spatio-temporal gating network, further improving overall prediction accuracy. Experiments on real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that STGormer achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we focus on an instance of spatio-temporal learning problem--traffic prediction--to demonstrate an advanced deep learning model developed for making accurate and reliable forecast. Despite the significant progress in traffic prediction, limited studies have incorporated both explicit and implicit traffic patterns simultaneously to improve prediction performance. Meanwhile, the variability nature of traffic states necessitates quantifying the uncertainty of model predictions in a statistically principled way; however, extant studies offer no provable guarantee on the statistical validity of confidence intervals in reflecting its actual likelihood of containing the ground truth. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end traffic prediction framework that leverages three primary components to generate accurate and reliable traffic predictions: dynamic causal structure learning for discovering implicit traffic patterns from massive traffic data, causally-aware spatio-temporal multi-graph convolution network (CASTMGCN) for learning spatio-temporal dependencies, and conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification. CASTMGCN fuses several graphs that characterize different important aspects of traffic networks and an auxiliary graph that captures the effect of exogenous factors on the road network. On this basis, a conformal prediction approach tailored to spatio-temporal data is further developed for quantifying the uncertainty in node-wise traffic predictions over varying prediction horizons. Experimental results on two real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art models in prediction accuracy; moreover, it generates more efficient prediction regions than other methods while strictly satisfying the statistical validity in coverage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Road Traffic Prediction using Real-time Regional Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12882v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For traffic prediction in transportation services such as car-sharing and ride-hailing, mid-term road traffic prediction (within a few hours) is considered essential. However, the existing road-level traffic prediction has mainly studied how significantly micro traffic events propagate to the adjacent roads in terms of short-term prediction. On the other hand, recent attempts have been made to incorporate regional knowledge such as POIs, road characteristics, and real-time social events to help traffic prediction. However, these studies lack in understandings of different modalities of road-level and region-level spatio-temporal correlations and how to combine such knowledge. This paper proposes a novel method that embeds real-time region-level knowledge using POIs, satellite images, and real-time LTE access traces via a regional spatio-temporal module that consists of dynamic convolution and temporal attention, and conducts bipartite spatial transform attention to convert into road-level knowledge. Then the model ingests this embedded knowledge into a road-level attention-based prediction model. Experimental results on real-world road traffic prediction show that our model outperforms the baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geolocation Representation from Large Language Models are Generic Enhancers for Spatio-Temporal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12116v1)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the geospatial domain, universal representation models are significantly less prevalent than their extensive use in natural language processing and computer vision. This discrepancy arises primarily from the high costs associated with the input of existing representation models, which often require street views and mobility data. To address this, we develop a novel, training-free method that leverages large language models (LLMs) and auxiliary map data from OpenStreetMap to derive geolocation representations (LLMGeovec). LLMGeovec can represent the geographic semantics of city, country, and global scales, which acts as a generic enhancer for spatio-temporal learning. Specifically, by direct feature concatenation, we introduce a simple yet effective paradigm for enhancing multiple spatio-temporal tasks including geographic prediction (GP), long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), and graph-based spatio-temporal forecasting (GSTF). LLMGeovec can seamlessly integrate into a wide spectrum of spatio-temporal learning models, providing immediate enhancements. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMGeovec achieves global coverage and significantly boosts the performance of leading GP, LTSF, and GSTF models.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOAP: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Relation and Motion Information Capturing for Few-Shot Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16344v3)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High frame-rate (HFR) videos of action recognition improve fine-grained expression while reducing the spatio-temporal relation and motion information density. Thus, large amounts of video samples are continuously required for traditional data-driven training. However, samples are not always sufficient in real-world scenarios, promoting few-shot action recognition (FSAR) research. We observe that most recent FSAR works build spatio-temporal relation of video samples via temporal alignment after spatial feature extraction, cutting apart spatial and temporal features within samples. They also capture motion information via narrow perspectives between adjacent frames without considering density, leading to insufficient motion information capturing. Therefore, we propose a novel plug-and-play architecture for FSAR called Spatio-tempOral frAme tuPle enhancer (SOAP) in this paper. The model we designed with such architecture refers to SOAP-Net. Temporal connections between different feature channels and spatio-temporal relation of features are considered instead of simple feature extraction. Comprehensive motion information is also captured, using frame tuples with multiple frames containing more motion information than adjacent frames. Combining frame tuples of diverse frame counts further provides a broader perspective. SOAP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance across well-known benchmarks such as SthSthV2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51. Extensive empirical evaluations underscore the competitiveness, pluggability, generalization, and robustness of SOAP.

The color, shape, and location of moire patterns may differ across video frames, posing a challenge in learning information from adjacent frames and preserving temporal consistency. Previous video demoireing methods heavily rely on well-designed alignment modules, resulting in substantial computational burdens. Recently, Mamba, an improved version of the State Space Model (SSM), has demonstrated significant potential for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, enabling efficient temporal modeling in video demoireing without requiring a specific alignment module. In this paper, we propose a novel alignment-free Raw video demoireing network with frequency-assisted spatio-temporal Mamba (DemMamba). The Spatial Mamba Block (SMB) and Temporal Mamba Block (TMB) are sequentially arranged to facilitate effective intra- and inter-relationship modeling in Raw videos with moire patterns. Within SMB, an Adaptive Frequency Block (AFB) is introduced to aid demoireing in the frequency domain. For TMB, a Channel Attention Block (CAB) is embedded to further enhance temporal information interactions by exploiting the inter-channel relationships among features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DemMamba surpasses state-of-the-art approaches by 1.3 dB and delivers a superior visual experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-temporal Prediction Methodology Based on Deep Learning and Real Wi-Fi Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09423v1)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of Wi-Fi technologies in recent years has caused a significant increase in the traffic usage. Hence, knowledge obtained from Wi-Fi network measurements can be helpful for a more efficient network management. In this paper, we propose a methodology to predict future values of some specific network metrics (e.g. traffic load, transmission failures, etc.). These predictions may be useful for improving the network performance. After data collection and preprocessing, the correlation between each target access point (AP) and its neighbouring APs is estimated. According to these correlations, either an only-temporal or a spatio-temporal based prediction is done. To evaluate the proposed methodology, real measurements are collected from 100 APs deployed in different university buildings for 3 months. Deep Learning (DL) methods (i.e. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Simple Recurrent Neural Network (SRNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Transformer) are evaluated and compared for both temporal and spatio-temporal based predictions. Moreover, a hybrid prediction methodology is proposed using a spatial processing based on CNN and a temporal prediction based on RNN. The proposed hybrid methodology provides an improvement in the prediction accuracy at expenses of a slight increase in the Training Computational Time (TCT) and negligible in Prediction Computational Time (PCT).</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Temporal Reversed Training for Spiking Neural Networks with Generalized Spatio-Temporal Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09108v1)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention as an ultra-low energy computing paradigm. Recent studies have focused on improving the feature extraction capability of SNNs, but they suffer from inefficient inference and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective temporal reversed training (TRT) method to optimize the spatio-temporal performance of SNNs and circumvent these problems. We perturb the input temporal data by temporal reversal, prompting the SNN to produce original-reversed consistent output logits and to learn perturbation-invariant representations. For static data without temporal dimension, we generalize this strategy by exploiting the inherent temporal property of spiking neurons for spike feature temporal reversal. In addition, we utilize the lightweight ``star operation" (element-wise multiplication) to hybridize the original and temporally reversed spike firing rates and expand the implicit dimensions, which serves as spatio-temporal regularization to further enhance the generalization of the SNN. Our method involves only an additional temporal reversal operation and element-wise multiplication during training, thus incurring negligible training overhead and not affecting the inference efficiency at all. Extensive experiments on static/neuromorphic object/action recognition, and 3D point cloud classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method. In particular, with only two timesteps, our method achieves 74.77\% and 90.57\% accuracy on ImageNet and ModelNet40, respectively.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |

However, existing models often face limitations in generalization, struggling with zero-shot prediction on unseen regions and cities, as well as diminished long-term accuracy. This is primarily due to the inherent challenges in handling the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of traffic data, coupled with the significant distribution shift across time and space. In this work, we aim to unlock new possibilities for building versatile, resilient and adaptive spatio-temporal foundation models for traffic prediction. To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel foundation model, named OpenCity, that can effectively capture and normalize the underlying spatio-temporal patterns from diverse data characteristics, facilitating zero-shot generalization across diverse urban environments. OpenCity integrates the Transformer architecture with graph neural networks to model the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in traffic data. By pre-training OpenCity on large-scale, heterogeneous traffic datasets, we enable the model to learn rich, generalizable representations that can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of traffic forecasting scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that OpenCity exhibits exceptional zero-shot predictive performance. Moreover, OpenCity showcases promising scaling laws, suggesting the potential for developing a truly one-for-all traffic prediction solution that can adapt to new urban contexts with minimal overhead.

The safety risk and urgency of autonomous vehicles in the absence of collision are evaluated. To ensure safety and improve road efficiency, a method of pre-compiling the spatio-temporal trajectory of vehicles is established to eliminate conflicts between vehicles in advance. The calculation method of the safe distance under spatio-temporal conditions is studied, considering vehicle speed differences, vehicle positioning errors, and clock errors. By combining collision acceleration and urgent acceleration, an evaluation model for vehicle conflict risk is constructed. Mainline vehicles that may have conflicts with on-ramp vehicles are identified, and the target gap for on-ramp vehicles is determined. Finally, a cooperative control method is established based on the selected target gap, preparing the vehicle travel path in advance. Taking highway ramp merge as an example, the mainline priority spatio-temporal cooperative control method is proposed and verified through simulation.

In microservices systems, this task encounters the challenge of dynamic and complex spatio-temporal relationships among microservice instances, primarily due to dynamic deployments, diverse call paths, and cascading effects among instances. Current time-series forecasting methods, which focus mainly on intrinsic patterns, are insufficient in environments where spatial relationships are critical. Similarly, spatio-temporal graph approaches often neglect the nature of temporal trend, concentrating mostly on message passing between nodes. Moreover, current research in microservices domain frequently underestimates the importance of network metrics and topological structures in capturing the evolving dynamics of systems. This paper introduces STMformer, a model tailored for forecasting system states in microservices environments, capable of handling multi-node and multivariate time series. Our method leverages dynamic network connection data and topological information to assist in modeling the intricate spatio-temporal relationships within the system. Additionally, we integrate the PatchCrossAttention module to compute the impact of cascading effects globally. We have developed a dataset based on a microservices system and conducted comprehensive experiments with STMformer against leading methods. In both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks, our model consistently achieved a 8.6% reduction in MAE(Mean Absolute Error) and a 2.2% reduction in MSE (Mean Squared Error).

Nonetheless, these methods mainly adopt imagepair appearance matching and face challenges of the intrinsic high quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism, resulting in constrained exploitation of temporal information. Inspired by the recently emerged State Space Model Mamba, renowned for its impressive long sequence modeling capabilities and linear computational complexity, this work innovatively proposes a pure Mamba-based framework (MambaVT) to fully exploit spatio-temporal contextual modeling for robust visible-thermal tracking. Specifically, we devise the long-range cross-frame integration component to globally adapt to target appearance variations, and introduce short-term historical trajectory prompts to predict the subsequent target states based on local temporal location clues. Extensive experiments show the significant potential of vision Mamba for RGB-T tracking, with MambaVT achieving state-of-the-art performance on four mainstream benchmarks while requiring lower computational costs. We aim for this work to serve as a simple yet strong baseline, stimulating future research in this field. The code and pre-trained models will be made available.</p></details> |  |

The standard neuron model for spike-based computation on such neuromorphic systems has long been the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron. As a promising advancement, a computationally light augmentation of the LIF neuron model with an adaptation mechanism experienced a recent upswing in popularity, caused by demonstrations of its superior performance on spatio-temporal processing tasks. The root of the superiority of these so-called adaptive LIF neurons however, is not well understood. In this article, we thoroughly analyze the dynamical, computational, and learning properties of adaptive LIF neurons and networks thereof. We find that the frequently observed stability problems during training of such networks can be overcome by applying an alternative discretization method that results in provably better stability properties than the commonly used Euler-Forward method. With this discretization, we achieved a new state-of-the-art performance on common event-based benchmark datasets. We also show that the superiority of networks of adaptive LIF neurons extends to the prediction and generation of complex time series. Our further analysis of the computational properties of networks of adaptive LIF neurons shows that they are particularly well suited to exploit the spatio-temporal structure of input sequences. Furthermore, these networks are surprisingly robust to shifts of the mean input strength and input spike rate, even when these shifts were not observed during training. As a consequence, high-performance networks can be obtained without any normalization techniques such as batch normalization or batch-normalization through time.</p></details> |  |

We find that under stronger additional assumptions, the spatio-temporal compressor can be directly applied to distributed computing algorithms, while its default form can also be successfully applied through observer-based differential compression methods, ensuring the linear convergence of the algorithm when the objective function is strongly convex. On this basis, we also discuss the acceleration of the algorithm, filter-based compression methods in the literature, and the addition of randomness to the spatio-temporal compressor. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the generality of the spatio-temporal compressor, compare different compression methods, and verify the algorithm's performance in the convex objective function scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2408.02332</p></details> |

Existing works typically involve extracting global features from full-resolution video frames and training frame-level classifiers to detect anomalies in the temporal dimension. However, most anomalous events tend to occur in localized spatial regions rather than the entire video frames, which implies existing frame-level feature based works may be misled by the dominant background information and lack the interpretation of the detected anomalies. To address this dilemma, this paper introduces a novel method called STPrompt that learns spatio-temporal prompt embeddings for weakly supervised video anomaly detection and localization (WSVADL) based on pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). Our proposed method employs a two-stream network structure, with one stream focusing on the temporal dimension and the other primarily on the spatial dimension. By leveraging the learned knowledge from pre-trained VLMs and incorporating natural motion priors from raw videos, our model learns prompt embeddings that are aligned with spatio-temporal regions of videos (e.g., patches of individual frames) for identify specific local regions of anomalies, enabling accurate video anomaly detection while mitigating the influence of background information. Without relying on detailed spatio-temporal annotations or auxiliary object detection/tracking, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks for the WSVADL task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM2024</p></details> |

Considering the spatio-temporal nature of EEG data, one of our frameworks is based on a CNN-BiLSTM model. The other involves a CNN-Transformer architecture which inherently involves the more versatile attention based learning paradigm. In both cases, a special 1D-CNN feature extraction module is used to generate the initial embeddings with 1D convolutions in the time and the EEG channel domains. Considering the EEG signals are noisy, non stationary and the discriminative features are even less clear (than in semantically structured data such as text or image), we also follow a window-based classification followed by majority voting during inference, to yield labels at a signal level. To illustrate how brain patterns correlate with different image classes, we visualize t-SNE plots of the BiLSTM embeddings alongside brain activation maps for the top 10 classes. These visualizations provide insightful revelations into the distinct neural signatures associated with each visual category, showcasing the BiLSTM's capability to capture and represent the discriminative brain activity linked to visual stimuli. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on the updated EEG-Imagenet dataset with positive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been submitted at ICPR 2024.

However, existing transformer-based methods primarily use self-attention mechanisms for spatio-temporal modeling, leading to a quadratic complexity, unidirectional modeling of spatio-temporal relationships, and insufficient learning of spatial-temporal correlations. Recently, the Mamba architecture, utilizing the state space model (SSM), has exhibited superior long-range modeling capabilities in a variety of vision tasks with linear complexity. In this paper, we propose PoseMamba, a novel purely SSM-based approach with linear complexity for 3D human pose estimation in monocular video. Specifically, we propose a bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block that comprehensively models human joint relations within individual frames as well as temporal correlations across frames. Within this bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block, we introduce a reordering strategy to enhance the local modeling capability of the SSM. This strategy provides a more logical geometric scanning order and integrates it with the global SSM, resulting in a combined global-local spatial scan. We have quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated our approach using two benchmark datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoseMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets while maintaining a smaller model size and reducing computational costs. The code and models will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion Models for EEG Super-Resolution in Epilepsy Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03089v3)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, particularly high-density EEG (HD EEG) devices, is widely used in fields such as neuroscience. HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, meeting the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STADMs) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which then serve as conditional inputs to guide the reverse denoising process of diffusion models. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STADMs demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks of epilepsy patients, indicating their potential to significantly improve the spatial resolution of LR EEG.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpecSTG: A Fast Spectral Diffusion Framework for Probabilistic Spatio-Temporal Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08119v3)** | 2024-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting, a crucial application of spatio-temporal graph (STG) learning, has traditionally relied on deterministic models for accurate point estimations. Yet, these models fall short of quantifying future uncertainties. Recently, many probabilistic methods, especially variants of diffusion models, have been proposed to fill this gap. However, existing diffusion methods typically deal with individual sensors separately when generating future time series, resulting in limited usage of spatial information in the probabilistic learning process. In this work, we propose SpecSTG, a novel spectral diffusion framework, to better leverage spatial dependencies and systematic patterns inherent in traffic data. More specifically, our method generates the Fourier representation of future time series, transforming the learning process into the spectral domain enriched with spatial information. Additionally, our approach incorporates a fast spectral graph convolution designed for Fourier input, alleviating the computational burden associated with existing models. Compared with state-of-the-arts, SpecSTG achieves up to 8% improvements on point estimations and up to 0.78% improvements on quantifying future uncertainties. Furthermore, SpecSTG's training and validation speed is 3.33X of the most efficient existing diffusion method for STG forecasting. The source code for SpecSTG is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SpecSTG.</p></details> |  |
| **[SGSR: Structure-Guided Multi-Contrast MRI Super-Resolution via Spatio-Frequency Co-Query Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03194v1)** | 2024-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a leading diagnostic modality for a wide range of exams, where multiple contrast images are often acquired for characterizing different tissues. However, acquiring high-resolution MRI typically extends scan time, which can introduce motion artifacts. Super-resolution of MRI therefore emerges as a promising approach to mitigate these challenges. Earlier studies have investigated the use of multiple contrasts for MRI super-resolution (MCSR), whereas majority of them did not fully exploit the rich contrast-invariant structural information. To fully utilize such crucial prior knowledge of multi-contrast MRI, in this work, we propose a novel structure-guided MCSR (SGSR) framework based on a new spatio-frequency co-query attention (CQA) mechanism. Specifically, CQA performs attention on features of multiple contrasts with a shared structural query, which is particularly designed to extract, fuse, and refine the common structures from different contrasts. We further propose a novel frequency-domain CQA module in addition to the spatial domain, to enable more fine-grained structural refinement. Extensive experiments on fastMRI knee data and low-field brain MRI show that SGSR outperforms state-of-the-art MCSR methods with statistical significance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 15th International Workshop on Machine Learning in Medical Imaging (MLMI 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Communication Compression in Distributed Prime-Dual Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02332v1)** | 2024-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study distributed prime-dual flows for multi-agent optimization with spatio-temporal compressions. The central aim of multi-agent optimization is for a network of agents to collaboratively solve a system-level optimization problem with local objective functions and node-to-node communication by distributed algorithms. The scalability of such algorithms crucially depends on the complexity of the communication messages, and a number of communication compressors for distributed optimization have recently been proposed in the literature. First of all, we introduce a general spatio-temporal compressor characterized by the stability of the resulting dynamical system along the vector field of the compressor. We show that several important distributed optimization compressors such as the greedy sparsifier, the uniform quantizer, and the scalarizer all fall into the category of this spatio-temporal compressor. Next, we propose two distributed prime-dual flows with the spatio-temporal compressors being applied to local node states and local error states, respectively, and prove (exponential) convergence of the node trajectories to the global optimizer for (strongly) convex cost functions. Finally, a few numerical examples are present to illustrate our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |
| **[STDA: Spatio-Temporal Dual-Encoder Network Incorporating Driver Attention to Predict Driver Behaviors Under Safety-Critical Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01774v1)** | 2024-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate behavior prediction for vehicles is essential but challenging for autonomous driving. Most existing studies show satisfying performance under regular scenarios, but most neglected safety-critical scenarios. In this study, a spatio-temporal dual-encoder network named STDA for safety-critical scenarios was developed. Considering the exceptional capabilities of human drivers in terms of situational awareness and comprehending risks, driver attention was incorporated into STDA to facilitate swift identification of the critical regions, which is expected to improve both performance and interpretability. STDA contains four parts: the driver attention prediction module, which predicts driver attention; the fusion module designed to fuse the features between driver attention and raw images; the temporary encoder module used to enhance the capability to interpret dynamic scenes; and the behavior prediction module to predict the behavior. The experiment data are used to train and validate the model. The results show that STDA improves the G-mean from 0.659 to 0.719 when incorporating driver attention and adopting a temporal encoder module. In addition, extensive experimentation has been conducted to validate that the proposed module exhibits robust generalization capabilities and can be seamlessly integrated into other mainstream models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unveiling land use dynamics: Insights from a hierarchical Bayesian spatio-temporal modelling of Compositional Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21695v2)** | 2024-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Changes in land use patterns have significant environmental and socioeconomic impacts, making it crucial for policymakers to understand their causes and consequences. This study, part of the European LAMASUS (Land Management for Sustainability) project, aims to support the EU's climate neutrality target by developing a governance model through collaboration between policymakers, land users, and researchers. We present a methodological synthesis for treating land use data using a Bayesian approach within spatial and spatio-temporal modeling frameworks. The study tackles the challenges of analyzing land use changes, particularly the presence of zero values and computational issues with large datasets. It introduces joint model structures to address zeros and employs sequential inference and consensus methods for Big Data problems. Spatial downscaling models approximate smaller scales from aggregated data, circumventing high-resolution data complications. We explore Beta regression and Compositional Data Analysis (CoDa) for land use data, review relevant spatial and spatio-temporal models, and present strategies for handling zeros. The paper demonstrates the implementation of key models, downscaling techniques, and solutions to Big Data challenges with examples from simulated data and the LAMASUS project, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding and managing land use changes.</p></details> | 29 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Partial Sensing Forecast for Long-term Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02689v1)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting uses recent measurements by sensors installed at chosen locations to forecast the future road traffic. Existing work either assumes all locations are equipped with sensors or focuses on short-term forecast. This paper studies partial sensing traffic forecast of long-term traffic, assuming sensors only at some locations. The study is important in lowering the infrastructure investment cost in traffic management since deploying sensors at all locations could incur prohibitively high cost. However, the problem is challenging due to the unknown distribution at unsensed locations, the intricate spatio-temporal correlation in long-term forecasting, as well as noise in data and irregularities in traffic patterns (e.g., road closure). We propose a Spatio-Temporal Partial Sensing (STPS) forecast model for long-term traffic prediction, with several novel contributions, including a rank-based embedding technique to capture irregularities and overcome noise, a spatial transfer matrix to overcome the spatial distribution shift from permanently sensed locations to unsensed locations, and a multi-step training process that utilizes all available data to successively refine the model parameters for better accuracy. Extensive experiments on several real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that STPS outperforms the state-of-the-art and achieves superior accuracy in partial sensing long-term forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mixed moving average field guided learning for spatio-temporal data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00736v4)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Influenced mixed moving average fields are a versatile modeling class for spatio-temporal data. However, their predictive distribution is not generally known. Under this modeling assumption, we define a novel spatio-temporal embedding and a theory-guided machine learning approach that employs a generalized Bayesian algorithm to make ensemble forecasts. We use Lipschitz predictors and determine fixed-time and any-time PAC Bayesian bounds in the batch learning setting. Performing causal forecast is a highlight of our methodology as its potential application to data with spatial and temporal short and long-range dependence. We then test the performance of our learning methodology by using linear predictors and data sets simulated from a spatio-temporal Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</p></details> |  |
| **[SARN: Structurally-Aware Recurrent Network for Spatio-Temporal Disaggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07292v4)** | 2024-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open data is frequently released spatially aggregated, usually to comply with privacy policies. But coarse, heterogeneous aggregations complicate learning and integration for downstream AI/ML systems. In this work, we consider models to disaggregate spatio-temporal data from a low-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., census tract) to a high-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., city block). We propose an overarching model named the Structurally-Aware Recurrent Network (SARN), which integrates structurally-aware spatial attention (SASA) layers into the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model. The spatial attention layers capture spatial interactions among regions, while the gated recurrent module captures the temporal dependencies. Each SASA layer calculates both global and structural attention -- global attention facilitates comprehensive interactions between different geographic levels, while structural attention leverages the containment relationship between different geographic levels (e.g., a city block being wholly contained within a census tract) to ensure coherent and consistent results. For scenarios with limited historical training data, we explore transfer learning and show that a model pre-trained on one city variable can be fine-tuned for another city variable using only a few hundred samples. Evaluating these techniques on two mobility datasets, we find that on both datasets, SARN significantly outperforms other neural models (5% and 1%) and typical heuristic methods (40% and 14%), enabling us to generate realistic, high-quality fine-grained data for downstream applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpaER: Learning Spatio-temporal Equivariant Representations for Fetal Brain Motion Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20198v3)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce SpaER, a pioneering method for fetal motion tracking that leverages equivariant filters and self-attention mechanisms to effectively learn spatio-temporal representations. Different from conventional approaches that statically estimate fetal brain motions from pairs of images, our method dynamically tracks the rigid movement patterns of the fetal head across temporal and spatial dimensions. Specifically, we first develop an equivariant neural network that efficiently learns rigid motion sequences through low-dimensional spatial representations of images. Subsequently, we learn spatio-temporal representations by incorporating time encoding and self-attention neural network layers. This approach allows for the capture of long-term dependencies of fetal brain motion and addresses alignment errors due to contrast changes and severe motion artifacts. Our model also provides a geometric deformation estimation that properly addresses image distortions among all time frames. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to learn spatial-temporal representations via deep neural networks for fetal motion tracking without data augmentation. We validated our model using real fetal echo-planar images with simulated and real motions. Our method carries significant potential value in accurately measuring, tracking, and correcting fetal motion in fetal MRI sequences.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions (MICCAI) Workshop on Perinatal Imaging, Placental and Preterm Image analysis (PIPPI) 2024</p></details> |
| **[STANet: A Novel Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network for Depression Classification with Small and Unbalanced FMRI Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21323v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate diagnosis of depression is crucial for timely implementation of optimal treatments, preventing complications and reducing the risk of suicide. Traditional methods rely on self-report questionnaires and clinical assessment, lacking objective biomarkers. Combining fMRI with artificial intelligence can enhance depression diagnosis by integrating neuroimaging indicators. However, the specificity of fMRI acquisition for depression often results in unbalanced and small datasets, challenging the sensitivity and accuracy of classification models. In this study, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network (STANet) for diagnosing depression by integrating CNN and RNN to capture both temporal and spatial features of brain activity. STANet comprises the following steps:(1) Aggregate spatio-temporal information via ICA. (2) Utilize multi-scale deep convolution to capture detailed features. (3) Balance data using the SMOTE to generate new samples for minority classes. (4) Employ the AFGRU classifier, which combines Fourier transformation with GRU, to capture long-term dependencies, with an adaptive weight assignment mechanism to enhance model generalization. The experimental results demonstrate that STANet achieves superior depression diagnostic performance with 82.38% accuracy and a 90.72% AUC. The STFA module enhances classification by capturing deeper features at multiple scales. The AFGRU classifier, with adaptive weights and stacked GRU, attains higher accuracy and AUC. SMOTE outperforms other oversampling methods. Additionally, spatio-temporal aggregated features achieve better performance compared to using only temporal or spatial features. STANet outperforms traditional or deep learning classifiers, and functional connectivity-based classifiers, as demonstrated by ten-fold cross-validation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal areal models to support small area estimation: An application to national-scale forest carbon monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09909v2)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>National Forest Inventory (NFI) programs can provide vital information on the status, trend, and change in forest parameters. These programs are being increasingly asked to provide forest parameter estimates for spatial and temporal extents smaller than their current design and accompanying design-based methods can deliver with desired levels of uncertainty. Many NFI designs and estimation methods focus on status and are not well equipped to provide acceptable estimates for trend and change parameters, especially over small spatial domains and/or short time periods. Fine-scale space-time indexed estimates are critical to a variety of environmental, ecological, and economic monitoring efforts. Estimates for forest carbon status, trend, and change are of particular importance to international initiatives to track carbon dynamics. Model-based small area estimation (SAE) methods for NFI and similar ecological monitoring data typically pursue inference on status within small spatial domains, with few demonstrated methods that account for spatio-temporal dependence needed for trend and change estimation. We propose a spatio-temporal Bayesian model framework that delivers statistically valid estimates with full uncertainty quantification for status, trend, and change. The framework accommodates a variety of space and time dependency structures, and we detail model configurations for different settings. Through analysis of simulated datasets, we compare the relative performance of candidate models and a traditional direct estimator. We then apply candidate models to a large-scale NFI dataset to demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework for providing unique quantification of forest carbon dynamics in the contiguous United States. We also provide computationally efficient algorithms, software, and data to reproduce our results and for benchmarking.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpotFormer: Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Transformer for Facial Expression Spotting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20799v1)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial expression spotting, identifying periods where facial expressions occur in a video, is a significant yet challenging task in facial expression analysis. The issues of irrelevant facial movements and the challenge of detecting subtle motions in micro-expressions remain unresolved, hindering accurate expression spotting. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for facial expression spotting. First, we propose a Sliding Window-based Multi-Resolution Optical flow (SW-MRO) feature, which calculates multi-resolution optical flow of the input image sequence within compact sliding windows. The window length is tailored to perceive complete micro-expressions and distinguish between general macro- and micro-expressions. SW-MRO can effectively reveal subtle motions while avoiding severe head movement problems. Second, we propose SpotFormer, a multi-scale spatio-temporal Transformer that simultaneously encodes spatio-temporal relationships of the SW-MRO features for accurate frame-level probability estimation. In SpotFormer, our proposed Facial Local Graph Pooling (FLGP) and convolutional layers are applied for multi-scale spatio-temporal feature extraction. We show the validity of the architecture of SpotFormer by comparing it with several model variants. Third, we introduce supervised contrastive learning into SpotFormer to enhance the discriminability between different types of expressions. Extensive experiments on SAMM-LV and CAS(ME)^2 show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models, particularly in micro-expression spotting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Orca: Ocean Significant Wave Height Estimation with Spatio-temporally Aware Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20053v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Significant wave height (SWH) is a vital metric in marine science, and accurate SWH estimation is crucial for various applications, e.g., marine energy development, fishery, early warning systems for potential risks, etc. Traditional SWH estimation methods that are based on numerical models and physical theories are hindered by computational inefficiencies. Recently, machine learning has emerged as an appealing alternative to improve accuracy and reduce computational time. However, due to limited observational technology and high costs, the scarcity of real-world data restricts the potential of machine learning models. To overcome these limitations, we propose an ocean SWH estimation framework, namely Orca. Specifically, Orca enhances the limited spatio-temporal reasoning abilities of classic LLMs with a novel spatiotemporal aware encoding module. By segmenting the limited buoy observational data temporally, encoding the buoys' locations spatially, and designing prompt templates, Orca capitalizes on the robust generalization ability of LLMs to estimate significant wave height effectively with limited data. Experimental results on the Gulf of Mexico demonstrate that Orca achieves state-of-the-art performance in SWH estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Deepsets for Off-policy Evaluation under Spatial or Spatio-temporal Interferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17910v1)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is widely applied in sectors such as pharmaceuticals and e-commerce to evaluate the efficacy of novel products or policies from offline datasets. This paper introduces a causal deepset framework that relaxes several key structural assumptions, primarily the mean-field assumption, prevalent in existing OPE methodologies that handle spatio-temporal interference. These traditional assumptions frequently prove inadequate in real-world settings, thereby restricting the capability of current OPE methods to effectively address complex interference effects. In response, we advocate for the implementation of the permutation invariance (PI) assumption. This innovative approach enables the data-driven, adaptive learning of the mean-field function, offering a more flexible estimation method beyond conventional averaging. Furthermore, we present novel algorithms that incorporate the PI assumption into OPE and thoroughly examine their theoretical foundations. Our numerical analyses demonstrate that this novel approach yields significantly more precise estimations than existing baseline algorithms, thereby substantially improving the practical applicability and effectiveness of OPE methodologies. A Python implementation of our proposed method is available at https://github.com/BIG-S2/Causal-Deepsets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video-Language Alignment via Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11677v2)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-language alignment is a crucial multi-modal task that benefits various downstream applications, e.g., video-text retrieval and video question answering. Existing methods either utilize multi-modal information in video-text pairs or apply global and local alignment techniques to promote alignment precision. However, these methods often fail to fully explore the spatio-temporal relationships among vision tokens within video and across different video-text pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer module to uniformly learn spatial and temporal contexts for video-language alignment pre-training (dubbed STGT). Specifically, our STGT combines spatio-temporal graph structure information with attention in transformer block, effectively utilizing the spatio-temporal contexts. In this way, we can model the relationships between vision tokens, promoting video-text alignment precision for benefiting downstream tasks. In addition, we propose a self-similarity alignment loss to explore the inherent self-similarity in the video and text. With the initial optimization achieved by contrastive learning, it can further promote the alignment accuracy between video and text. Experimental results on challenging downstream tasks, including video-text retrieval and video question answering, verify the superior performance of our method.</p></details> | under review |

| **[MEV Capture Through Time-Advantaged Arbitrage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10797v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As blockchains begin processing significant economic activity, the ability to include and order transactions inevitably becomes highly valuable, a concept known as Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). This makes effective mechanisms for transaction inclusion and ordering, and thereby the extraction of MEV, a key aspect of blockchain design. Beyond traditional approaches such as ordering in a first-come-first-serve manner or using priority fees, a recent proposal suggests auctioning off a time advantage for transaction inclusion. In this paper, we investigate this time advantage mechanism, focusing specifically on arbitrage opportunities on Automated Market Makers (AMMs), one of the largest sources of MEV today. We analyze the optimal strategy for a time-advantaged arbitrageur and compare the profits generated by various MEV extraction methods. Finally, we explore how AMMs can be adapted in the time advantage setting to capture a portion of the MEV.</p></details> |  |

Incorporating statistical inference in RL algorithms is essential for understanding and managing uncertainty in model performance. This paper introduces a time-varying batch-averaged Q-learning algorithm, termed sampleaveraged Q-learning, which improves upon traditional single-sample Q-learning by aggregating samples of rewards and next states to better account for data variability and uncertainty. We leverage the functional central limit theorem (FCLT) to establish a novel framework that provides insights into the asymptotic normality of the sample-averaged algorithm under mild conditions. Additionally, we develop a random scaling method for interval estimation, enabling the construction of confidence intervals without requiring extra hyperparameters. Numerical experiments conducted on classic OpenAI Gym environments show that the time-varying sample-averaged Q-learning method consistently outperforms both single-sample and constant-batch Q-learning methods, achieving superior accuracy while maintaining comparable learning speeds.</p></details> |  |

The algorithm computes the expectation value of any observable for any circuit, with a small average error over input states drawn from an ensemble (e.g. the computational basis). Our approach is based upon the intuition that noise exponentially damps non-local correlations relative to local correlations. This enables one to classically simulate a noisy quantum circuit by only keeping track of the dynamics of local quantum information. Our algorithm also enables sampling from the output distribution of a circuit in quasi-polynomial time, so long as the distribution anti-concentrates. A number of practical implications are discussed, including a fundamental limit on the efficacy of noise mitigation strategies: for constant noise rates, any quantum circuit for which error mitigation is efficient on most input states, is also classically simulable on most input states.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures + 30 page Appendix</p></details> |

We discuss the process of curating diverse, representative, and challenging time series datasets, highlighting the importance of domain relevance and data complexity. Additionally, we investigate multi-task learning strategies that leverage the benchmark dataset to enhance the performance of time series models. This research contributes to the broader goal of advancing the state-of-the-art in time series modeling by adopting successful strategies from the NLP domain.</p></details> |  |

A two-stage least squares estimation method based on profile local linear dummy variables (2SLS-PLLDV) is proposed to estimate both constant and time-varying coefficients without the need for first differencing. The asymptotic properties of the estimator are derived under certain conditions. Furthermore, a residual-based goodness-of-fit test is constructed for the model, and a residual-based bootstrap method is used to obtain p-values. Simulation studies show the good performance of the proposed method in various scenarios. The Chinese provincial carbon emission data set is analyzed for illustration.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 3 figures, codes</p></details> |

Instead of estimating a high-dimensional model at each time and inferring changes later, we directly learn the differential parameter, i.e., the time derivative of the parameter. The main idea is treating the time score function of an exponential family model as a linear model of the differential parameter for direct estimation. We use time score matching to estimate parameter derivatives. We prove the consistency of a regularized score matching objective and demonstrate the finite-sample normality of a debiased estimator in high-dimensional settings. Our methodology effectively infers differential structures in high-dimensional graphical models, verified on simulated and real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Danie...</summary><p>Daniel J.

The Chapman-Enskog analysis is presented to confirm the consistency of this scheme at macroscopic level. Some numerical experiments further demonstrate that it achieves second-order convergence and exhibits better numerical performance over previous schemes as reported [2-4].</p></details> | 9 pages |

Yet, current methods are usually evaluated on benchmarks that are only a simplification of real-world scenarios. Hence, we propose to validate test-time adaptation methods using the recently introduced datasets for autonomous driving, namely CLAD-C and SHIFT. We observe that current test-time adaptation methods struggle to effectively handle varying degrees of domain shift, often resulting in degraded performance that falls below that of the source model. We noticed that the root of the problem lies in the inability to preserve the knowledge of the source model and adapt to dynamically changing, temporally correlated data streams. Therefore, we enhance the well-established self-training framework by incorporating a small memory buffer to increase model stability and at the same time perform dynamic adaptation based on the intensity of domain shift. The proposed method, named AR-TTA, outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and more real-world benchmarks and shows robustness across a variety of TTA scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/dmn-sjk/AR-TTA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for BMVC2024</p></details> |

Previous works introduced viable blockchain sealed-bid auction protocols, leveraging timed commitments for bid encryption. However, a crucial challenge remains unresolved in these works: Who should bear the cost of decrypting these timed commitments? This work introduces a timed commitment outsourcing market as a solution to the aforementioned challenge. We first introduce an aggregation scheme for timed commitments, which combines all bidders' timed commitments into one while ensuring security and correctness and allowing a varying number of bidders. Next, we remodel the utility of auctioneers and timed commitment solvers, developing a new timed commitment competition mechanism and combining it with the sealed-bid auction to form a two-sided market. The protocol includes bid commitment collection, timed commitment solving, and payment. Through game-theoretical analysis, we prove that our protocol satisfies Dominant Strategy Incentive Compatibility (DSIC) for bidders, Bayesian Incentive Compatibility (BIC) for solvers, and achieves optimal revenue for the auctioneer among a large class of mechanisms. Finally, we prove that no mechanism can achieve positive expected revenue for the auctioneer while satisfying DSIC and Individual Rationality (IR) for both bidders and solvers.</p></details> | 23 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Transparent Networks for Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10535v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transparent models, which are machine learning models that produce inherently interpretable predictions, are receiving significant attention in high-stakes domains. However, despite much real-world data being collected as time series, there is a lack of studies on transparent time series models. To address this gap, we propose a novel transparent neural network model for time series called Generalized Additive Time Series Model (GATSM). GATSM consists of two parts: 1) independent feature networks to learn feature representations, and 2) a transparent temporal module to learn temporal patterns across different time steps using the feature representations. This structure allows GATSM to effectively capture temporal patterns and handle dynamic-length time series while preserving transparency. Empirical experiments show that GATSM significantly outperforms existing generalized additive models and achieves comparable performance to black-box time series models, such as recurrent neural networks and Transformer. In addition, we demonstrate that GATSM finds interesting patterns in time series. The source code is available at https://github.com/gim4855744/GATSM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploiting Local Features and Range Images for Small Data Real-Time Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10510v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation of point clouds is an essential task for understanding the environment in autonomous driving and robotics. Recent range-based works achieve real-time efficiency, while point- and voxel-based methods produce better results but are affected by high computational complexity. Moreover, highly complex deep learning models are often not suited to efficiently learn from small datasets. Their generalization capabilities can easily be driven by the abundance of data rather than the architecture design. In this paper, we harness the information from the three-dimensional representation to proficiently capture local features, while introducing the range image representation to incorporate additional information and facilitate fast computation. A GPU-based KDTree allows for rapid building, querying, and enhancing projection with straightforward operations. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate the benefits of our modification in a ``small data'' setup, in which only one sequence of the dataset is used to train the models, but also in the conventional setup, where all sequences except one are used for training. We show that a reduced version of our model not only demonstrates strong competitiveness against full-scale state-of-the-art models but also operates in real-time, making it a viable choice for real-world case applications. The code of our method is available at https://github.com/Bender97/WaffleAndRange.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |
| **[A Practical Approach to Causal Inference over Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10502v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we focus on estimating the causal effect of an intervention over time on a dynamical system. To that end, we formally define causal interventions and their effects over time on discrete-time stochastic processes (DSPs). Then, we show under which conditions the equilibrium states of a DSP, both before and after a causal intervention, can be captured by a structural causal model (SCM). With such an equivalence at hand, we provide an explicit mapping from vector autoregressive models (VARs), broadly applied in econometrics, to linear, but potentially cyclic and/or affected by unmeasured confounders, SCMs. The resulting causal VAR framework allows us to perform causal inference over time from observational time series data. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed framework achieves strong performance in terms of observational forecasting while enabling accurate estimation of the causal effect of interventions on dynamical systems. We demonstrate, through a case study, the potential practical questions that can be addressed using the proposed causal VAR framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Closer Look at Time Steps is Worthy of Triple Speed-Up for Diffusion Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17403v2)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training diffusion models is always a computation-intensive task. In this paper, we introduce a novel speed-up method for diffusion model training, called, which is based on a closer look at time steps. Our key findings are: i) Time steps can be empirically divided into acceleration, deceleration, and convergence areas based on the process increment. ii) These time steps are imbalanced, with many concentrated in the convergence area. iii) The concentrated steps provide limited benefits for diffusion training. To address this, we design an asymmetric sampling strategy that reduces the frequency of steps from the convergence area while increasing the sampling probability for steps from other areas. Additionally, we propose a weighting strategy to emphasize the importance of time steps with rapid-change process increments. As a plug-and-play and architecture-agnostic approach, SpeeD consistently achieves 3-times acceleration across various diffusion architectures, datasets, and tasks. Notably, due to its simple design, our approach significantly reduces the cost of diffusion model training with minimal overhead. Our research enables more researchers to train diffusion models at a lower cost.</p></details> |  |

In response, this paper presents Personalized Alignment at Decoding-time (PAD), a novel framework designed to align LLM outputs with diverse personalized preferences during the inference phase, eliminating the need for additional training. By introducing a unique personalized reward modeling strategy, this framework decouples the text generation process from personalized preferences, facilitating the generation of generalizable token-level personalized rewards. The PAD algorithm leverages these rewards to guide the decoding process, dynamically tailoring the base model's predictions to personalized preferences. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PAD not only outperforms existing training-based alignment methods in terms of aligning with diverse preferences but also shows significant generalizability to preferences unseen during training and scalability across different base models. This work advances the capability of LLMs to meet user needs in real-time applications, presenting a substantial step forward in personalized LLM alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper presents Personalized Alignment at Decoding-time (PAD), a novel framework designed to align LLM outputs with diverse personalized preferences during the inference phase</p></details> |
| **[Advancing Newborn Care: Precise Birth Time Detection Using AI-Driven Thermal Imaging with Adaptive Normalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10483v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Around 5-10\% of newborns need assistance to start breathing. Currently, there is a lack of evidence-based research, objective data collection, and opportunities for learning from real newborn resuscitation emergency events. Generating and evaluating automated newborn resuscitation algorithm activity timelines relative to the Time of Birth (ToB) offers a promising opportunity to enhance newborn care practices. Given the importance of prompt resuscitation interventions within the "golden minute" after birth, having an accurate ToB with second precision is essential for effective subsequent analysis of newborn resuscitation episodes. Instead, ToB is generally registered manually, often with minute precision, making the process inefficient and susceptible to error and imprecision. In this work, we explore the fusion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and thermal imaging to develop the first AI-driven ToB detector. The use of temperature information offers a promising alternative to detect the newborn while respecting the privacy of healthcare providers and mothers. However, the frequent inconsistencies in thermal measurements, especially in a multi-camera setup, make normalization strategies critical. Our methodology involves a three-step process: first, we propose an adaptive normalization method based on Gaussian mixture models (GMM) to mitigate issues related to temperature variations; second, we implement and deploy an AI model to detect the presence of the newborn within the thermal video frames; and third, we evaluate and post-process the model's predictions to estimate the ToB. A precision of 88.1\% and a recall of 89.3\% are reported in the detection of the newborn within thermal frames during performance evaluation. Our approach achieves an absolute median deviation of 2.7 seconds in estimating the ToB relative to the manual annotations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper submitted to Computer in Biology and Medicine, ELSEVIER</p></details> |
| **[Moirai-MoE: Empowering Time Series Foundation Models with Sparse Mixture of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10469v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models have demonstrated impressive performance as zero-shot forecasters. However, achieving effectively unified training on time series remains an open challenge. Existing approaches introduce some level of model specialization to account for the highly heterogeneous nature of time series data. For instance, Moirai pursues unified training by employing multiple input/output projection layers, each tailored to handle time series at a specific frequency. Similarly, TimesFM maintains a frequency embedding dictionary for this purpose. We identify two major drawbacks to this human-imposed frequency-level model specialization: (1) Frequency is not a reliable indicator of the underlying patterns in time series. For example, time series with different frequencies can display similar patterns, while those with the same frequency may exhibit varied patterns. (2) Non-stationarity is an inherent property of real-world time series, leading to varied distributions even within a short context window of a single time series. Frequency-level specialization is too coarse-grained to capture this level of diversity. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Moirai-MoE, using a single input/output projection layer while delegating the modeling of diverse time series patterns to the sparse mixture of experts (MoE) within Transformers. With these designs, Moirai-MoE reduces reliance on human-defined heuristics and enables automatic token-level specialization. Extensive experiments on 39 datasets demonstrate the superiority of Moirai-MoE over existing foundation models in both in-distribution and zero-shot scenarios. Furthermore, this study conducts comprehensive model analyses to explore the inner workings of time series MoE foundation models and provides valuable insights for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strong solution and approximation of time-dependent radial Dunkl processes with multiplicative noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10457v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the strong existence and uniqueness of solutions within a Weyl chamber for a class of time-dependent particle systems driven by multiplicative noise. This class includes well-known processes in physics and mathematical finance. We propose a method to prove the existence of negative moments for the solutions. This result allows us to analyze two numerical schemes for approximating the solutions. The first scheme is a $\theta$-Euler--Maruyama scheme, which ensures that the approximated solution remains within the Weyl chamber. The second scheme is a truncated $\theta$-Euler--Maruyama scheme, which produces values in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ instead of the Weyl chamber $\mathbb{W}$, offering improved computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Domain-Conditioned Transformer for Fully Test-time Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10442v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fully test-time adaptation aims to adapt a network model online based on sequential analysis of input samples during the inference stage. We observe that, when applying a transformer network model into a new domain, the self-attention profiles of image samples in the target domain deviate significantly from those in the source domain, which results in large performance degradation during domain changes. To address this important issue, we propose a new structure for the self-attention modules in the transformer. Specifically, we incorporate three domain-conditioning vectors, called domain conditioners, into the query, key, and value components of the self-attention module. We learn a network to generate these three domain conditioners from the class token at each transformer network layer. We find that, during fully online test-time adaptation, these domain conditioners at each transform network layer are able to gradually remove the impact of domain shift and largely recover the original self-attention profile. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed domain-conditioned transformer significantly improves the online fully test-time domain adaptation performance and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by large margins.</p></details> |  |

However, the advancement of these models has been hindered by the lack of comprehensive benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce the General Time Series Forecasting Model Evaluation, GIFT-Eval, a pioneering benchmark aimed at promoting evaluation across diverse datasets. GIFT-Eval encompasses 28 datasets over 144,000 time series and 177 million data points, spanning seven domains, 10 frequencies, multivariate inputs, and prediction lengths ranging from short to long-term forecasts. To facilitate the effective pretraining and evaluation of foundation models, we also provide a non-leaking pretraining dataset containing approximately 230 billion data points. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of 17 baselines, which includes statistical models, deep learning models, and foundation models. We discuss each model in the context of various benchmark characteristics and offer a qualitative analysis that spans both deep learning and foundation models. We believe the insights from this analysis, along with access to this new standard zero-shot time series forecasting benchmark, will guide future developments in time series foundation models. The codebase, datasets, and a leaderboard showing all the results in detail will be available soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Time Complexity Algorithms for Computing General Random Walk Graph Kernels on Sparse Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10368v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first linear time complexity randomized algorithms for unbiased approximation of the celebrated family of general random walk kernels (RWKs) for sparse graphs. This includes both labelled and unlabelled instances. The previous fastest methods for general RWKs were of cubic time complexity and not applicable to labelled graphs. Our method samples dependent random walks to compute novel graph embeddings in $\mathbb{R}^d$ whose dot product is equal to the true RWK in expectation. It does so without instantiating the direct product graph in memory, meaning we can scale to massive datasets that cannot be stored on a single machine. We derive exponential concentration bounds to prove that our estimator is sharp, and show that the ability to approximate general RWKs (rather than just special cases) unlocks efficient implicit graph kernel learning. Our method is up to $\mathbf{27\times}$ faster than its counterparts for efficient computation on large graphs and scales to graphs $\mathbf{128 \times}$ bigger than largest examples amenable to brute-force computation.</p></details> |  |

Machine learning (ML) techniques have been emerging in diagnosing motor conditions using only motor phase current signals. This study converts time-series motor current signals to time-frequency 2D plots using Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) methods. The motor current signal dataset consists of 3,750 sample points with five classes - one healthy and four synthetically-applied motor fault conditions, and with five loading conditions: 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100%. Five transformation methods are used on the dataset: non-overlap and overlap STFTs, non-overlap and overlap realigned STFTs, and synchrosqueezed STFT. Then, deep learning (DL) models based on the previous Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture are trained and validated from generated plots of each method. The DL models of overlap-STFT, overlap R-STFT, non-overlap STFT, non-overlap R-STFT, and synchrosqueezed-STFT performed exceptionally with an average accuracy of 97.65, 96.03, 96.08, 96.32, and 88.27%, respectively. Four methods outperformed the previous best ML method with 93.20% accuracy, while all five outperformed previous 2D-plot-based methods with accuracy of 80.25, 74.80, and 82.80%, respectively, using the same dataset, same DL architecture, and validation steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 6 images, presented at 2024 International Conference on Diagnostics in Electrical Engineering (Diagnostika)</p></details> |

This requires high-performance hardware with predictable timing behavior. State-of-the-art real-time hardware is limited in memory and compute resources. On the other hand, modern accelerator systems lack the necessary predictability properties, mainly due to interference in the memory subsystem. We present a new hardware architecture with an accompanying compiler-based deployment toolchain to close this gap between performance and predictability. The hardware architecture consists of a multicore vector processor with predictable cores, each with local scratchpad memories. A central management core facilitates access to shared external memory through a static schedule calculated at compile-time. The presented compiler exploits the fixed data flow of neural networks and WCET estimates of subtasks running on individual cores to compute this schedule. Through this approach, the WCET estimate of the overall system can be obtained from the subtask WCET estimates, data transfer times, and access times of the shared memory in conjunction with the schedule calculated by the compiler.</p></details> |  |

We consider the basic case of a single connected domain where absorbing or Neumann boundary conditions are enforced. Energy estimates limit the exponential growth of solutions to the initial value problem, thereby confining Floquet exponents to a complex half-space under absorbing boundary conditions and to a strip near the real axis for Neumann conditions. We introduce a system of coupled harmonics and establish a Fredholm alternative result using Riesz-Schauder theory. For a finite set of harmonics, we show that the spectrum remains discrete. Different eigenvalue formulations for the Floquet exponents are formulated and connected to these results. Employing a space discretization to the system of coupled harmonics filters spatially oscillating modes, which is shown to imply a localization result for the temporal spectrum of the fully discrete coupled harmonics. Such a localization result is the key to further analysis, since the truncation of the coupled harmonics is critically affected for non-localized modes. We use the localization result to show that, when enough harmonics are included, the approximated Floquet exponents exhibit the same limitations as their continuous counterparts. Moreover, the approximated modes are shown to satisfy the defining properties of Bloch modes, with a defect that vanishes as the number of harmonics approaches infinity. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and illustrate the theoretical findings.</p></details> | 33 pages, 7 figures |

Edge AI facilitates the processing of Internet of Things (IoT) data and provides privacy-enabled and latency-sensitive services to application users using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, e.g., Time Series Classification (TSC). However, existing TSC algorithms require access to full raw data and demand substantial computing resources to train and use them effectively in runtime. This makes them impractical for deployment in resource-constrained Edge environments. To address this, in this paper, we propose an Adaptive Brownian Bridge-based Symbolic Aggregation Vector Space Model (ABBA-VSM). It is a new TSC model designed for classification services on Edge. Here, we first adaptively compress the raw time series into symbolic representations, thus capturing the changing trends of data. Subsequently, we train the classification model directly on these symbols. ABBA-VSM reduces communication data between IoT and Edge devices, as well as computation cycles, in the development of resource-efficient TSC services on Edge. We evaluate our solution with extensive experiments using datasets from the UCR time series classification archive. The results demonstrate that the ABBA-VSM achieves up to 80% compression ratio and 90-100% accuracy for binary classification. Whereas, for non-binary classification, it achieves an average compression ratio of 60% and accuracy ranging from 60-80%.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages with references, 5 figures</p></details> |

Considering this product as a linear transformation leads to interesting findings on the topological relevance of both paths and activities using singular value decomposition. The notion of spectral networks is introduced to condense the fundamental structure of the project network. A definition of project stress is introduced to establish a comparison index between two alternatives in terms of slack. Additionally, the Moore-Penrose inverse of $\mathbf{R}$ is presented to find the configuration of the durations of the activities resulting in a given simple path duration vector. Then, the systematic mapping review process carried out to assess our claims' novelty is reported. Finally, we reflect on the notion of relevance for paths and activities and the relationship of the incidence matrix with the proposed approach.</p></details> | 20 pages, 2 figures |

Using a new recursive scheme based on the structural properties of median graphs, we provide a quasilinear-time algorithm to determine all eccentricities for this well-known family of graphs. Our recursive technique manages specifically balanced and unbalanced parts of the $\Theta$-class decomposition of median graphs. The exact running time of our algorithm is O(n log^4 n). This outcome not only answers a question asked by B{\'e}n{\'e}teau et al. (2020) but also greatly improves a recent result which presents a combinatorial algorithm running in time O(n^1.6408 log^{O(1)} n) for the same problem.Furthermore we also propose a distance oracle for median graphs with both polylogarithmic size and query time. Speaking formally, we provide a combinatorial algorithm which computes for any median graph G, in quasilinear time O(n log^4 n), vertex-labels of size O(log^3 n) such that any distance of G can be retrieved in time O(log^4 n) thanks to these labels.</p></details> |  |

The test relies on an auxiliary integer $d$ which can be chosen arbitrarily, using which a new time series of length $d$ is constructed. For this new time series, the test statistic is derived according to the classical $g$ test by Fisher. Under the null hypothesis of a constant success probability it is shown that the test keeps the level asymptotically, while it has power for most alternatives, i.e. typically in the case of $r \ge 3$ and where $r$ and $d$ have common divisors.</p></details> |  |

We propose a new decoupling Constant Scalar Auxiliary Variable (D-CSAV) method which is easy to generalize to schemes with high order accuracy in time. The method is designed using the "zero-energy-contribution" property while maintaining conservative time discretization for the "non-zero-energy-contribution" terms. Our algorithm simplifies to solving three independent linear elliptic systems per time step, two of them with constant coefficients. The update of all scalar auxiliary variables is explicit and decoupled from solving the phase field variable and velocity field. We rigorously prove unconditional energy stability of the scheme and perform extensive benchmark simulations to demonstrate accuracy and efficiency of the method.</p></details> |  |

Drawing from concepts in Hamiltonian mechanics, we develop a symplectic optimizer and a new loss function to capture the complex dynamics of credit risk evolution. Using the Freddie Mac Single-Family Loan-Level Dataset, we evaluate our model's performance against other machine learning approaches. Our method shows superior discriminative power in OOT scenarios, as measured by the Area Under the Curve (AUC), indicating better ranking ability and robustness to class imbalance. The Hamiltonian-inspired approach shows particular strength in maintaining consistent performance between in-sample and OOT test sets, suggesting improved generalization to future, unseen data. These findings suggest that physics-inspired techniques offer a promising direction for developing more robust and reliable credit scoring models, particularly in uncertain economic situations.</p></details> |  |

Google's PageRank is an essential algorithm for arranging the web pages on the World Wide Web in classical computation. From a broader perspective, it is also a fundamental measure for quantifying the importance of vertices in a network. Similarly, the new quantum PageRank also serves to quantify the significance of a network's vertices. In this work, we extend the concept of discrete-time open quantum walk on arbitrary directed and undirected graphs by utilizing the Weyl operators as Kraus operators. This new model of quantum walk is useful for building up the quantum PageRank algorithm, discussed in this article. We compare the classical PageRank and the newly defined quantum PageRank for different types of complex networks, such as the scale-free network, Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random network, Watts-Strogatz network, spatial network, Zachary Karate club network, GNC, GN, GNR networks, Barab\'asi and Albert network, etc. In addition, we study the convergence of the quantum PageRank process and its dependency on the damping factor $\alpha$.

While retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems using large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in industry to assist with such tasks, RAG faces challenges in real-time conversations, such as inaccurate query formulation and redundant retrieval of frequently asked questions (FAQs). To address these limitations, we propose a decision support system that can look beyond RAG by first identifying customer questions in real time. If the query matches an FAQ, the system retrieves the answer directly from the FAQ database; otherwise, it generates answers via RAG. Our approach reduces reliance on manual queries, providing responses to agents within 2 seconds. Deployed in AI-powered human-agent assist solution at Minerva CQ, this system improves efficiency, reduces AHT, and lowers operational costs. We also introduce an automated LLM-agentic workflow to identify FAQs from historical transcripts when no predefined FAQs exist.</p></details> |  |

We collect 438 Connections games to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) against expert and novice human players. Our results show that even the best performing LLM, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which has otherwise shown impressive reasoning abilities on a wide variety of benchmarks, can only fully solve 18% of the games. Novice and expert players perform better than Claude 3.5 Sonnet, with expert human players significantly outperforming it. We create a taxonomy of the knowledge types required to successfully cluster and categorize words in the Connections game. We find that while LLMs perform relatively well on categorizing words based on semantic relations they struggle with other types of knowledge such as Encyclopedic Knowledge, Multiword Expressions or knowledge that combines both Word Form and Meaning.

We propose MuseTalk, which generates lip-sync targets in a latent space encoded by a Variational Autoencoder, enabling high-fidelity talking face video generation with efficient inference. Specifically, we project the occluded lower half of the face image and itself as an reference into a low-dimensional latent space and use a multi-scale U-Net to fuse audio and visual features at various levels. We further propose a novel sampling strategy during training, which selects reference images with head poses closely matching the target, allowing the model to focus on precise lip movement by filtering out redundant information. Additionally, we analyze the mechanism of lip-sync loss and reveal its relationship with input information volume. Extensive experiments show that MuseTalk consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in visual fidelity and achieves comparable lip-sync accuracy. As MuseTalk supports the online generation of face at 256x256 at more than 30 FPS with negligible starting latency, it paves the way for real-time applications.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |

Most of the existing methods focus on the motion alignment between the edited video and the reference video. However, these methods do not constrain the background and object content of the video to remain unchanged, which makes it possible for users to generate unexpected videos. In this paper, we propose a one-shot video motion editing method called Edit-Your-Motion that requires only a single text-video pair for training. Specifically, we design the Detailed Prompt-Guided Learning Strategy (DPL) to decouple spatio-temporal features in space-time diffusion models. DPL separates learning object content and motion into two training stages. In the first training stage, we focus on learning the spatial features (the features of object content) and breaking down the temporal relationships in the video frames by shuffling them. We further propose Recurrent-Causal Attention (RC-Attn) to learn the consistent content features of the object from unordered video frames. In the second training stage, we restore the temporal relationship in video frames to learn the temporal feature (the features of the background and object's motion). We also adopt the Noise Constraint Loss to smooth out inter-frame differences. Finally, in the inference stage, we inject the content features of the source object into the editing branch through a two-branch structure (editing branch and reconstruction branch). With Edit-Your-Motion, users can edit the motion of objects in the source video to generate more exciting and diverse videos. Comprehensive qualitative experiments, quantitative experiments and user preference studies demonstrate that Edit-Your-Motion performs better than other methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Linear Attention in Polynomial Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10101v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous research has explored the computational expressivity of Transformer models in simulating Boolean circuits or Turing machines. However, the learnability of these simulators from observational data has remained an open question. Our study addresses this gap by providing the first polynomial-time learnability results (specifically strong, agnostic PAC learning) for single-layer Transformers with linear attention. We show that linear attention may be viewed as a linear predictor in a suitably defined RKHS. As a consequence, the problem of learning any linear transformer may be converted into the problem of learning an ordinary linear predictor in an expanded feature space, and any such predictor may be converted back into a multiheaded linear transformer. Moving to generalization, we show how to efficiently identify training datasets for which every empirical risk minimizer is equivalent (up to trivial symmetries) to the linear Transformer that generated the data, thereby guaranteeing the learned model will correctly generalize across all inputs. Finally, we provide examples of computations expressible via linear attention and therefore polynomial-time learnable, including associative memories, finite automata, and a class of Universal Turing Machine (UTMs) with polynomially bounded computation histories. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on three tasks: learning random linear attention networks, key--value associations, and learning to execute finite automata. Our findings bridge a critical gap between theoretical expressivity and learnability of Transformers, and show that flexible and general models of computation are efficiently learnable.</p></details> |  |

According to the evolution rules of optical access standards, Beyond 50G optical access data rate may achieve 200Gb/s. Direct detection faces great challenges for Beyond 50G optical access, which makes coherent detection a potential solution. Similar to 50G optical timing-division-multiple access (TDMA), burst-mode digital signal processing (BM-DSP) is also required for Beyond 50G coherent optical TDMA (CO-TDMA). This paper proposes coherent BM-DSP (Co-BM-DSP) based on approximately 10ns designed preambles to process the burst signal for 200G CO-TDMA, which can fast estimate the state of polarization, frequency offset, sampling phase offset, synchronization position, and equalizer coefficients. Meanwhile, for obtaining the equalizer coefficients based on the designed preamble, the channel estimation based on the minimum-mean-square-error criterion is theoretically proven to have a unique solution for ensuring reliability. In conclusion, the proposed Co-BM-DSP based on the designed preambles paves the way for the applications of Beyond 50G CO-TDMA.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to the Journal of Lightwave Technology</p></details> |

The emerging paradigms of goal-oriented communication constitute closed loops integrating communication, computation, and sensing. However, challenges arise for closed-loop timing analysis due to multiple random factors that affect the communication/computation latency, as well as the heterogeneity of feedback mechanisms across multi-modal sensing data. To tackle these problems, we aim to provide a unified timing analysis framework for closed-loop goal-oriented communication (CGC) systems over fading channels. The proposed framework is unified as it considers computation, compression, and communication latency in the loop with different configurations. To capture the heterogeneity across multi-modal feedback, we categorize the sensory data into the periodic-feedback and event-triggered, respectively. We formulate timing constraints based on average and tail performance, covering timeliness, jitter, and reliability of CGC systems. A method based on saddlepoint approximation is proposed to obtain the distribution of closed-loop latency. The results show that the modified saddlepoint approximation is capable of accurately characterizing the latency distribution of the loop with analytically tractable expressions. This sets the basis for low-complexity co-design of communication and computation.</p></details> |  |

| **[StatioCL: Contrastive Learning for Time Series via Non-Stationary and Temporal Contrast](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10048v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a promising approach for representation learning in time series data by embedding similar pairs closely while distancing dissimilar ones. However, existing CL methods often introduce false negative pairs (FNPs) by neglecting inherent characteristics and then randomly selecting distinct segments as dissimilar pairs, leading to erroneous representation learning, reduced model performance, and overall inefficiency. To address these issues, we systematically define and categorize FNPs in time series into semantic false negative pairs and temporal false negative pairs for the first time: the former arising from overlooking similarities in label categories, which correlates with similarities in non-stationarity and the latter from neglecting temporal proximity. Moreover, we introduce StatioCL, a novel CL framework that captures non-stationarity and temporal dependency to mitigate both FNPs and rectify the inaccuracies in learned representations. By interpreting and differentiating non-stationary states, which reflect the correlation between trends or temporal dynamics with underlying data patterns, StatioCL effectively captures the semantic characteristics and eliminates semantic FNPs. Simultaneously, StatioCL establishes fine-grained similarity levels based on temporal dependencies to capture varying temporal proximity between segments and to mitigate temporal FNPs. Evaluated on real-world benchmark time series classification datasets, StatioCL demonstrates a substantial improvement over state-of-the-art CL methods, achieving a 2.9% increase in Recall and a 19.2% reduction in FNPs. Most importantly, StatioCL also shows enhanced data efficiency and robustness against label scarcity.</p></details> | Accepted in CIKM24 |
| **[Are KAN Effective for Identifying and Tracking Concept Drift in Time Series?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10041v1)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic concepts in time series are crucial for understanding complex systems such as financial markets, healthcare, and online activity logs. These concepts help reveal structures and behaviors in sequential data for better decision-making and forecasting. Existing models struggle with detecting and tracking concept drift due to limitations in interpretability and adaptability. This paper introduces Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) into time series and proposes WormKAN, a KAN-based auto-encoder to address concept drift in co-evolving time series. WormKAN integrates the KAN-SR module, in which the encoder, decoder, and self-representation layer are built on KAN, along with a temporal constraint to capture concept transitions. These transitions, akin to passing through a "wormhole", are identified by abrupt changes in the latent space. Experiments show that KAN and KAN-based models (WormKAN) effectively segment time series into meaningful concepts, enhancing the identification and tracking of concept drifts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Theoretical and numerical indirect stabilization of coupled wave equations with a single time-delayed damping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09995v1)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The focal point of this paper is to theoretically investigate and numerically validate the effect of time delay on the exponential stabilization of a class of coupled hyperbolic systems with delayed and non-delayed dampings. The class in question consists of two strongly coupled wave equations featuring a delayed and non-delayed damping terms on the first wave equation. Through a standard change of variables and semi-group theory, we address the well-posedness of the considered coupled system. Thereon, based on some observability inequalities, we derive sufficient conditions guaranteeing the exponential decay of a suitable energy. On the other hand, from the numerical point of view, we validate the theoretical results in $1D$ domains based on a suitable numerical approximation obtained through the Finite Difference Method. More precisely, we construct a discrete numerical scheme which preserves the energy decay property of its continuous counterpart. Our theoretical analysis and implementation of our developed numerical scheme assert the effect of the time-delayed damping on the exponential stability of strongly coupled wave equations.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often fall short in terms of accuracy and efficiency, particularly in complex, real-time environments where player movements are frequently occluded or involve intricate interactions. To overcome these challenges, we propose the EITNet model, a deep learning framework that combines EfficientDet for object detection, I3D for spatiotemporal feature extraction, and TimeSformer for temporal analysis, all integrated with IoT technology for seamless real-time data collection and processing. Our contributions include developing a robust architecture that improves recognition accuracy to 92\%, surpassing the baseline EfficientDet model's 87\%, and reducing loss to below 5.0 compared to EfficientDet's 9.0 over 50 epochs. Furthermore, the integration of IoT technology enhances real-time data processing, providing adaptive insights into player performance and strategy. The paper details the design and implementation of EITNet, experimental validation, and a comprehensive evaluation against existing models. The results demonstrate EITNet's potential to significantly advance automated sports analysis and optimize data utilization for player performance and strategy improvement.</p></details> | pages |

To overcome this, the application of Transformer-based Vision Transformer (ViT) methods to fault diagnosis is gaining attraction. Nonetheless, these methods typically require extensive preprocessing, which increases computational complexity, potentially reducing the efficiency of the diagnosis process. Addressing this gap, this paper presents the Time Series Vision Transformer (TSViT), tailored for effective fault diagnosis. TSViT incorporates a convolutional layer to extract local features from vibration signals, alongside a transformer encoder to discern long-term temporal patterns. A thorough experimental comparison on three diverse datasets demonstrates TSViT's effectiveness and adaptability. Moreover, the paper delves into the influence of hyperparameter tuning on the model's performance, computational demand, and parameter count. Remarkably, TSViT achieves an unprecedented 100% average accuracy on two test sets and 99.99% on another, showcasing its exceptional diagnostic capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Local Attention Mechanism: Boosting the Transformer Architecture for Long-Sequence Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03805v2)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have become the leading choice in natural language processing over other deep learning architectures. This trend has also permeated the field of time series analysis, especially for long-horizon forecasting, showcasing promising results both in performance and running time. In this paper, we introduce Local Attention Mechanism (LAM), an efficient attention mechanism tailored for time series analysis. This mechanism exploits the continuity properties of time series to reduce the number of attention scores computed. We present an algorithm for implementing LAM in tensor algebra that runs in time and memory O(nlogn), significantly improving upon the O(n^2) time and memory complexity of traditional attention mechanisms. We also note the lack of proper datasets to evaluate long-horizon forecast models. Thus, we propose a novel set of datasets to improve the evaluation of models addressing long-horizon forecasting challenges. Our experimental analysis demonstrates that the vanilla transformer architecture magnified with LAM surpasses state-of-the-art models, including the vanilla attention mechanism. These results confirm the effectiveness of our approach and highlight a range of future challenges in long-sequence time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Bayesian promotion time cure model with current status data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09892v1)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analysis of lifetime data from epidemiological studies or destructive testing often involves current status censoring, wherein individuals are examined only once and their event status is recorded only at that specific time point. In practice, some of these individuals may never experience the event of interest, leading to current status data with a cured fraction. Cure models are used to estimate the proportion of non-susceptible individuals, the distribution of susceptible ones, and covariate effects. Motivated from a biological interpretation of cancer metastasis, promotion time cure model is a popular alternative to the mixture cure rate model for analysing such data. The current study is the first to put forth a Bayesian inference procedure for analysing current status data with a cure fraction, resorting to a promotion time cure model. An adaptive Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is utilised for posterior computation. Simulation studies prove our approach's efficiency, while analyses of lung tumor and breast cancer data illustrate its practical utility. This approach has the potential to improve clinical cure rates through the incorporation of prior knowledge regarding the disease dynamics and therapeutic options.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by financial time series, we analyze data that includes daily opening (O), up (U), low (L), and closing (C) values, rather than just a closing value as traditionally used. To tackle this, we propose a fundamental model based on stochastic differential equations, which also serves as a transformation of other widely used models, such as the log-transformed geometric Brownian motion model. We derive the joint distribution for these interval-valued observations using the reflection principle and Girsanov's theorem. The MLE is obtained by optimizing the log-likelihood function through first and second-order derivative calculations, utilizing the Newton-Raphson algorithm. We further propose a novel parametric bootstrap method to compute confidence intervals, addressing challenges related to temporal dependency and interval-based data relationships. The performance of the model is evaluated through extensive simulations and real data analysis using S&P500 returns during the 2022 Russo-Ukrainian War. The results demonstrate that the proposed OULC model consistently outperforms the traditional OC model, offering more accurate and reliable change-point detection and parameter estimates.</p></details> |  |

We propose an ADD method using prompt tuning in a plug-in style. It bridges domain gaps by integrating it seamlessly with state-of-the-art transformer models and/or with other fine-tuning methods, boosting their performance on target data (challenge (i)). In addition, our method can fit small target datasets because it does not require a large number of extra parameters (challenge (ii)). This feature also contributes to computational efficiency, countering the high computational costs typically associated with large-scale pre-trained models in ADD (challenge (iii)). We conclude that prompt tuning for ADD under domain gaps presents a promising avenue for enhancing accuracy with minimal target data and negligible extra computational burden.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Interspeech 2024.

| **[Learning Pattern-Specific Experts for Time Series Forecasting Under Patch-level Distribution Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09836v1)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting, which aims to predict future values based on historical data, has garnered significant attention due to its broad range of applications. However, real-world time series often exhibit complex non-uniform distribution with varying patterns across segments, such as season, operating condition, or semantic meaning, making accurate forecasting challenging. Existing approaches, which typically train a single model to capture all these diverse patterns, often struggle with the pattern drifts between patches and may lead to poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{TFPS}, a novel architecture that leverages pattern-specific experts for more accurate and adaptable time series forecasting. TFPS employs a dual-domain encoder to capture both time-domain and frequency-domain features, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of temporal dynamics. It then uses subspace clustering to dynamically identify distinct patterns across data patches. Finally, pattern-specific experts model these unique patterns, delivering tailored predictions for each patch. By explicitly learning and adapting to evolving patterns, TFPS achieves significantly improved forecasting accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TFPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in long-term forecasting, through its dynamic and pattern-aware learning approach. The data and codes are available: \url{https://github.com/syrGitHub/TFPS}.</p></details> |  |

To tackle these challenges, we propose PatchMixer, a novel CNN-based model. It introduces a permutation-variant convolutional structure to preserve temporal information. Diverging from conventional CNNs in this field, which often employ multiple scales or numerous branches, our method relies exclusively on depthwise separable convolutions. This allows us to extract both local features and global correlations using a single-scale architecture. Furthermore, we employ dual forecasting heads encompassing linear and nonlinear components to better model future curve trends and details. Our experimental results on seven time-series forecasting benchmarks indicate that compared with the state-of-the-art method and the best-performing CNN, PatchMixer yields $3.9\%$ and $21.2\%$ relative improvements, respectively, while being 2-3x faster than the most advanced method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at: https://github.com/Zeying-Gong/PatchMixer.

Since these methods operate in the time domain, they may fail to fully capture the dynamic patterns that are more apparent in the frequency domain, leading to suboptimal results. This paper first theoretically analyzes how normalization methods affect frequency components. We prove that the current normalization methods that operate in the time domain uniformly scale non-zero frequencies, and thus, they struggle to determine components that contribute to more robust forecasting. Therefore, we propose FredNormer, which observes datasets from a frequency perspective and adaptively up-weights the key frequency components. To this end, FredNormer consists of two components: a statistical metric that normalizes the input samples based on their frequency stability and a learnable weighting layer that adjusts stability and introduces sample-specific variations. Notably, FredNormer is a plug-and-play module, which does not compromise the efficiency compared to existing normalization methods. Extensive experiments show that FredNormer improves the averaged MSE of backbone forecasting models by 33.3% and 55.3% on the ETTm2 dataset. Compared to the baseline normalization methods, FredNormer achieves 18 top-1 results and 6 top-2 results out of 28 settings.</p></details> |  |

Current data-driven fuel leakage detection methods employ offline statistical inventory reconciliation, leading to significant detection delays. Consequently, this can result in substantial financial loss and environmental impact on the surrounding community. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Memory-based Online Change Point Detection (MOCPD) which operates in near real-time, enabling early detection of fuel leakage. MOCPD maintains a collection of representative historical data within a size-constrained memory, along with an adaptively computed threshold. Leaks are detected when the dissimilarity between the latest data and historical memory exceeds the current threshold. An update phase is incorporated in MOCPD to ensure diversity among historical samples in the memory. With this design, MOCPD is more robust and achieves a better recall rate while maintaining a reasonable precision score. We have conducted a variety of experiments comparing MOCPD to commonly used online change point detection (CPD) baselines on real-world fuel variance data with induced leakages, actual fuel leakage data and benchmark CPD datasets. Overall, MOCPD consistently outperforms the baseline methods in terms of detection accuracy, demonstrating its applicability to fuel leakage detection and CPD problems.</p></details> |  |

Practical implementation of these methods for the systems with nondiagonal linear part of equations is exacerbated by infeasibility of an analytical calculation of the exponential of a nondiagonal linear operator; in this case, the coefficients of the exponential time differencing scheme cannot be calculated analytically. We suggest an approach, where these coefficients are numerically calculated with auxiliary problems. We rewrite the high-order Runge--Kutta type schemes in terms of the solutions to these auxiliary problems and practically examine the accuracy and computational performance of these methods for a heterogeneous Cahn--Hilliard equation, a sixth-order spatial derivative equation governing pattern formation in the presence of an additional conservation law, and a Fokker--Planck equation governing macroscopic dynamics of a network of neurons.</p></details> | 21 pages, 11 figures |

For dynamic graph modeling, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a mainstream technique. However, they are generally pre-trained on the link prediction task, leaving a significant gap from the objectives of downstream tasks such as node classification. To bridge the gap, prompt-based learning has gained traction on graphs, but most existing efforts focus on static graphs, neglecting the evolution of dynamic graphs. In this paper, we propose DYGPROMPT, a novel pre-training and prompt learning framework for dynamic graph modeling. First, we design dual prompts to address the gap in both task objectives and temporal variations across pre-training and downstream tasks. Second, we recognize that node and time features mutually characterize each other, and propose dual condition-nets to model the evolving node-time patterns in downstream tasks. Finally, we thoroughly evaluate and analyze DYGPROMPT through extensive experiments on four public datasets.</p></details> | Under review |

Prior studies have attempted to enhance GNN performance by reconstructing node features during the testing phase without modifying the model parameters. However, these approaches lack theoretical analysis of the proximity between predictions and ground truth at test time. In this paper, we propose a novel node feature reconstruction method grounded in Lyapunov stability theory. Specifically, we model the GNN as a control system during the testing phase, considering node features as control variables. A neural controller that adheres to the Lyapunov stability criterion is then employed to reconstruct these node features, ensuring that the predictions progressively approach the ground truth at test time. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments across multiple datasets, demonstrating significant performance improvements.</p></details> |  |

Methods: We conducted two clinical studies involving 58 prediabetic veterans and 60 patients with obstructive sleep apnea to gather multimodal behavioral data using wearable devices. We develop multimodal long short-term memory (LSTM) network models, which are capable of forecasting the number of step counts of a patient up to 24 hours in advance by examining data from activity and engagement modalities. Furthermore, we design goal-based forecasting models to predict whether a person's next-day steps will be over a certain threshold. Results: Multimodal LSTM with early fusion achieves 33% and 37% lower mean absolute errors than linear regression and ARIMA respectively on the prediabetes dataset. LSTM also outperforms linear regression and ARIMA with a margin of 13% and 32% on the sleep dataset. Multimodal forecasting models also perform with 72% and 79% accuracy on the prediabetes dataset and sleep dataset respectively on goal-based forecasting. Conclusion: Our experiments conclude that multimodal LSTM models with early fusion are better than multimodal LSTM with late fusion and unimodal LSTM models and also than ARIMA and linear regression models. Significance: We address an important and challenging task of time-series forecasting in uncontrolled environments. Effective forecasting of a person's physical activity can aid in designing adaptive behavioral interventions to keep the user engaged and adherent to a prescribed routine.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |
| **[TimeBridge: Non-Stationarity Matters for Long-term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04442v2)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-stationarity poses significant challenges for multivariate time series forecasting due to the inherent short-term fluctuations and long-term trends that can lead to spurious regressions or obscure essential long-term relationships. Most existing methods either eliminate or retain non-stationarity without adequately addressing its distinct impacts on short-term and long-term modeling. Eliminating non-stationarity is essential for avoiding spurious regressions and capturing local dependencies in short-term modeling, while preserving it is crucial for revealing long-term cointegration across variates. In this paper, we propose TimeBridge, a novel framework designed to bridge the gap between non-stationarity and dependency modeling in long-term time series forecasting. By segmenting input series into smaller patches, TimeBridge applies Integrated Attention to mitigate short-term non-stationarity and capture stable dependencies within each variate, while Cointegrated Attention preserves non-stationarity to model long-term cointegration across variates. Extensive experiments show that TimeBridge consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term forecasting.

Unlike common data analysis frameworks, it builds up from well defined and reusable logical units (objects), which can be easily combined together in order to ensure a high level of consistency. Thanks to this approach, Timeseria can address by design several non-trivial issues often underestimated, such as handling data losses, non-uniform sampling rates, differences between aggregated data and punctual observations, time zones, daylight saving times, and more. Timeseria comes with a comprehensive set of base data structures, common data manipulation operations, and extensible models for data reconstruction, forecasting and anomaly detection. It also integrates a powerful plotting engine capable of handling even millions of data points.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces SituFont, a novel just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) system designed to enhance mobile text readability by semi-automatically adjusting font parameters in response to real-time contextual changes. Leveraging smartphone sensors and a human-in-the-loop approach, SituFont personalizes the reading experience by adapting to individual user preferences, including personal factors such as fatigue and distraction level, and environmental factors like lighting, motion, and location. To inform the design of SituFont, we conducted formative interviews (N=15) to identify key SVI factors affecting readability and controlled experiments (N=18) to quantify the relationship between these factors and optimal text parameters. We then evaluated SituFont's effectiveness through a comparative user study under eight simulated SVI scenarios (N=12), demonstrating its ability to overcome SVIs. Our findings highlight the potential of JITAI systems like SituFont to mitigate the impact of SVIs and enhance mobile accessibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model-based clustering of time-dependent observations with common structural changes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09552v1)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel model-based clustering approach for samples of time series. We assume as a unique commonality that two observations belong to the same group if structural changes in their behaviours happen at the same time. We resort to a latent representation of structural changes in each time series based on random orders to induce ties among different observations. Such an approach results in a general modeling strategy and can be combined with many time-dependent models known in the literature. Our studies have been motivated by an epidemiological problem, where we want to provide clusters of different countries of the European Union, where two countries belong to the same cluster if the spreading processes of the COVID-19 virus had structural changes at the same time.</p></details> |  |

However, the computational demands for these models pose a challenge when applying them to real-time tasks, such as composition assistance. To address this, we propose Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Composition Assistance (Hybrid-RACA), a novel system for real-time text prediction that efficiently combines a cloud-based LLM with a smaller client-side model through retrieval augmented memory. This integration enables the client model to generate better responses, benefiting from the LLM's capabilities and cloud-based data. Meanwhile, via a novel asynchronous memory update mechanism, the client model can deliver real-time completions to user inputs without the need to wait for responses from the cloud. Our experiments on five datasets demonstrate that Hybrid-RACA offers strong performance while maintaining low latency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2024 Industry Track</p></details> |

While various studies have analyzed statistical, machine learning, or deep learning approaches for household electricity STLF, recently proposed time series foundation models such as Chronos, TimesFM, or LagLlama have not yet been considered for household electricity STLF. These models are trained on a vast amount of time series data and are able to forecast time series without explicit task-specific training (zero-shot learning). In this study, we benchmark the forecasting capabilities of time series foundation models compared to Trained-from-Scratch (TFS) Transformer-based approaches. Our results suggest that foundation models perform comparably to TFS Transformer models, while the TimesFM foundation model outperforms all TFS models when the input size increases. At the same time, they require less effort, as they need no domain-specific training and only limited contextual data for inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Self-Attentions Effective for Time Series Forecasting?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16877v2)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is crucial for applications across multiple domains and various scenarios. Although Transformer models have dramatically advanced the landscape of forecasting, their effectiveness remains debated. Recent findings have indicated that simpler linear models might outperform complex Transformer-based approaches, highlighting the potential for more streamlined architectures. In this paper, we shift the focus from evaluating the overall Transformer architecture to specifically examining the effectiveness of self-attention for time series forecasting. To this end, we introduce a new architecture, Cross-Attention-only Time Series transformer (CATS), that rethinks the traditional Transformer framework by eliminating self-attention and leveraging cross-attention mechanisms instead. By establishing future horizon-dependent parameters as queries and enhanced parameter sharing, our model not only improves long-term forecasting accuracy but also reduces the number of parameters and memory usage. Extensive experiment across various datasets demonstrates that our model achieves superior performance with the lowest mean squared error and uses fewer parameters compared to existing models.

Typically, using kernels with high orders of smoothness on some sufficiently dense set of trial centers provides high spatial approximation accuracy that can exceed the accuracy of finite difference methods in time. The paper proposes a greedy approach for selecting trial subspaces in the kernel-based collocation method applied to time-stepping to balance errors in both well-conditioned and ill-conditioned scenarios. The approach involves selecting trial centers using a fast block-greedy algorithm with new stopping criteria that aim to balance temporal and spatial errors. Numerical simulations of coupled bulk-surface pattern formations, a system involving two functions in the domain and two on the boundary, illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing trial space dimensions while maintaining accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[MITA: Bridging the Gap between Model and Data for Test-time Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09398v1)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing the generalizability of models. However, existing mainstream TTA methods, predominantly operating at batch level, often exhibit suboptimal performance in complex real-world scenarios, particularly when confronting outliers or mixed distributions. This phenomenon stems from a pronounced over-reliance on statistical patterns over the distinct characteristics of individual instances, resulting in a divergence between the distribution captured by the model and data characteristics. To address this challenge, we propose Meet-In-The-Middle based Test-Time Adaptation ($\textbf{MITA}$), which introduces energy-based optimization to encourage mutual adaptation of the model and data from opposing directions, thereby meeting in the middle. MITA pioneers a significant departure from traditional approaches that focus solely on aligning the model to the data, facilitating a more effective bridging of the gap between model's distribution and data characteristics. Comprehensive experiments with MITA across three distinct scenarios (Outlier, Mixture, and Pure) demonstrate its superior performance over SOTA methods, highlighting its potential to significantly enhance generalizability in practical applications.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce IntrinsicVoic,e an LLM designed with intrinsic real-time voice interaction capabilities. IntrinsicVoice aims to facilitate the transfer of textual capabilities of pre-trained LLMs to the speech modality by mitigating the modality gap between text and speech. Our novelty architecture, GroupFormer, can reduce speech sequences to lengths comparable to text sequences while generating high-quality audio, significantly reducing the length difference between speech and text, speeding up inference, and alleviating long-text modeling issues. Additionally, we construct a multi-turn speech-to-speech dialogue dataset named \method-500k which includes nearly 500k turns of speech-to-speech dialogues, and a cross-modality training strategy to enhance the semantic alignment between speech and text. Experimental results demonstrate that IntrinsicVoice can generate high-quality speech response with latency lower than 100ms in multi-turn dialogue scenarios.

Based on the Mamba architecture and inspired by Prior-data Fitted Networks (PFNs), Mamba4Cast generalizes robustly across diverse time series tasks without the need for dataset specific fine-tuning. Mamba4Cast's key innovation lies in its ability to achieve strong zero-shot performance on real-world datasets while having much lower inference times than time series foundation models based on the transformer architecture. Trained solely on synthetic data, the model generates forecasts for entire horizons in a single pass, outpacing traditional auto-regressive approaches. Our experiments show that Mamba4Cast performs competitively against other state-of-the-art foundation models in various data sets while scaling significantly better with the prediction length.

| **[AutoTimes: Autoregressive Time Series Forecasters via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02370v3)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models of time series have not been fully developed due to the limited availability of time series corpora and the underexploration of scalable pre-training. Based on the similar sequential formulation of time series and natural language, increasing research demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging large language models (LLM) for time series. Nevertheless, the inherent autoregressive property and decoder-only architecture of LLMs have not been fully considered, resulting in insufficient utilization of LLM abilities. To fully revitalize the general-purpose token transition and multi-step generation capability of large language models, we propose AutoTimes to repurpose LLMs as autoregressive time series forecasters, which projects time series into the embedding space of language tokens and autoregressively generates future predictions with arbitrary lengths. Compatible with any decoder-only LLMs, the consequent forecaster exhibits the flexibility of the lookback length and scalability with larger LLMs. Further, we formulate time series as prompts, extending the context for prediction beyond the lookback window, termed in-context forecasting. By introducing LLM-embedded textual timestamps, AutoTimes can utilize chronological information to align multivariate time series. Empirically, AutoTimes achieves state-of-the-art with 0.1% trainable parameters and over $5\times$ training/inference speedup compared to advanced LLM-based forecasters. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/thuml/AutoTimes.</p></details> |  |

We present a novel two-level online algorithm, by integrating a higher-level learning strategy and a lower-level feedback control strategy. This method offers a practical and robust solution for online control, which achieves sublinear regret. Our work provides the first nonasymptotic results for controlling continuous-time linear systems with finite number of interactions with the system. Moreover, we examine how to train an agent in domain randomization environments from a non-stochastic control perspective. By applying our method to the SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) algorithm, we achieved improved results in multiple reinforcement learning tasks within domain randomization environments. Our work provides new insights into non-asymptotic analyses of controlling continuous-time systems. Furthermore, our work brings practical intuition into controller learning under non-stochastic environments.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a novel training-free framework for processing long texts, utilizing a divide-and-conquer strategy to achieve comprehensive document understanding. The proposed LLM$\times$MapReduce framework splits the entire document into several chunks for LLMs to read and then aggregates the intermediate answers to produce the final output. The main challenge for divide-and-conquer long text processing frameworks lies in the risk of losing essential long-range information when splitting the document, which can lead the model to produce incomplete or incorrect answers based on the segmented texts. Disrupted long-range information can be classified into two categories: inter-chunk dependency and inter-chunk conflict. We design a structured information protocol to better cope with inter-chunk dependency and an in-context confidence calibration mechanism to resolve inter-chunk conflicts. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM$\times$MapReduce can outperform representative open-source and commercial long-context LLMs, and is applicable to several different models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in Progress.

Currently, existing methodologies struggle to ascertain compliance with dynamic performance requirements during the design phase, often resulting in either excessive or insufficient design. Therefore, there is an urgent need for research focused on feed system design methods that directly address time domain dynamic precision. The dynamic precision of the feed system is influenced by the motor, mechanical structure, motion processes, and control system. However, existing studies on the impact mechanisms of electromechanical matching on feed system precision often overlook the roles of control and motion processes. This paper innovatively proposes the need to consider the coupling effects among subsystems, directing the optimization design of CNC machine tool feed systems towards time domain dynamic precision. Furthermore, it introduces acceleration and deceleration capability as a key indicator of electromechanical matching. Following the decoupling of control system parameters, this study elucidates the influence mechanisms of electromechanical matching on the overall dynamic performance of the feed system under various motion processes. This research offers a novel design philosophy and theoretical foundation for the optimization of CNC machine tool feed systems.</p></details> |  |

However, increasing network heterogeneity challenges general-purpose BWE algorithms, necessitating solutions that adapt to end-user environments. While widely adopted, heuristic-based methods are difficult to individualize without extensive domain expertise. Conversely, online reinforcement learning (RL) offers ease of customization but neglects prior domain expertise and suffers from sample inefficiency. Thus, we present Merlin, an imitation learning-based solution that replaces the manual parameter tuning of heuristic-based methods with data-driven updates to streamline end-user personalization. Our key insight is that transforming heuristic-based BWE algorithms into neural networks facilitates data-driven personalization. Merlin utilizes Behavioral Cloning to efficiently learn from offline telemetry logs, capturing heuristic policies without live network interactions. The cloned policy can then be seamlessly tailored to end user network conditions through online finetuning. In real intercontinental videoconferencing calls, Merlin matches our heuristic's policy with no statistically significant differences in user quality of experience (QoE). Finetuning Merlin's control policy to end-user environments enables QoE improvements of up to 7.8% compared to the heuristic policy. Lastly, our IL-based design performs competitively with current state-of-the-art online RL techniques but converges with 80% fewer videoconferencing samples, facilitating practical end-user personalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, under review.

Due to the lack of fine-grained temporal annotations, existing video benchmarks mostly resemble static image benchmarks and are incompetent at evaluating models for temporal understanding. In this paper, we introduce TemporalBench, a new benchmark dedicated to evaluating fine-grained temporal understanding in videos. TemporalBench consists of ~10K video question-answer pairs, derived from ~2K high-quality human annotations detailing the temporal dynamics in video clips. As a result, our benchmark provides a unique testbed for evaluating various temporal understanding and reasoning abilities such as action frequency, motion magnitude, event order, etc. Moreover, it enables evaluations on various tasks like both video question answering and captioning, both short and long video understanding, as well as different models such as multimodal video embedding models and text generation models. Results show that state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o achieve only 38.5% question answering accuracy on TemporalBench, demonstrating a significant gap (~30%) between humans and AI in temporal understanding. Furthermore, we notice a critical pitfall for multi-choice QA where LLMs can detect the subtle changes in negative captions and find a centralized description as a cue for its prediction, where we propose Multiple Binary Accuracy (MBA) to correct such bias. We hope that TemporalBench can foster research on improving models' temporal reasoning capabilities. Both dataset and evaluation code will be made available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://temporalbench.github.io/</p></details> |

Most previous video generation models are trained on short video clips, while recently there has been increasing interest in training long video generation models directly on longer videos. However, the lack of such high-quality long videos impedes the advancement of long video generation. To promote research in long video generation, we desire a new dataset with four key features essential for training long video generation models: (1) long videos covering at least 10 seconds, (2) long-take videos without cuts, (3) large motion and diverse contents, and (4) temporally dense captions. To achieve this, we introduce a new pipeline for selecting high-quality long-take videos and generating temporally dense captions. Specifically, we define a set of metrics to quantitatively assess video quality including scene cuts, dynamic degrees, and semantic-level quality, enabling us to filter high-quality long-take videos from a large amount of source videos. Subsequently, we develop a hierarchical video captioning pipeline to annotate long videos with temporally-dense captions. With this pipeline, we curate the first long-take video dataset, LVD-2M, comprising 2 million long-take videos, each covering more than 10 seconds and annotated with temporally dense captions. We further validate the effectiveness of LVD-2M by fine-tuning video generation models to generate long videos with dynamic motions. We believe our work will significantly contribute to future research in long video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Dataset and Benchmark Track.

The Linear Inverse Model (LIM) is a class of data-driven methods that extract dynamic and stochastic information from finite time-series data of complex systems. In this study, we introduce a new variant of LIM, called Colored-LIM, which models stochasticity using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck colored noise. Despite the non-trivial correlation between observable and colored noise, we show that Colored-LIM unveils the desired information merely from the correlation function of the observable. Therefore, this approach not only accounts for the memory effects of environmental noise, traditionally represented by time-uncorrelated white noise in the Classical LIM framework, but does so using the same observation dataset without requiring additional data. Furthermore, we show that Colored-LIM does not reduce to Classical LIM in the white noise limit, underscoring the importance of temporal dependencies in stochastic systems. In this paper, we rigorously develop the Colored-LIM, explore its connections with the Classical LIM and Dynamic Mode Decomposition, and validate its effectiveness on both ideal linear and nonlinear systems. In addition, we illustrate the potential applications and implications of Colored-LIM for real-world problems, including the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation and the electricity network of Tohoku University.</p></details> | 16 pages |

Accurate modeling and forecasting of these datasets can be extremely useful for policymakers to develop informed strategies for future planning. Echo State Networks (ESNs) are efficient methods for capturing nonlinear temporal dynamics and generating forecasts. However, ESNs lack a direct mechanism to account for the neighborhood structure inherent in area-level data. Ignoring these spatial relationships can significantly compromise the accuracy and utility of forecasts. In this paper, we incorporate approximate graph spectral filters at the input stage of the ESN, thereby improving forecast accuracy while preserving the model's computational efficiency during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using Eurostat's tourism occupancy dataset and show how it can support more informed decision-making in policy and planning contexts.</p></details> | 23 pages, 4 figures |

Equivariant contrastive learning, on the other hand, provides representations sensitive to specific image transformations while remaining invariant to others. By introducing equivariance to time-induced transformations, such as disease-related anatomical changes in longitudinal imaging, the model can effectively capture such changes in the representation space. In this work, we propose a Time-equivariant Contrastive Learning (TC) method. First, an encoder embeds two unlabeled scans from different time points of the same patient into the representation space. Next, a temporal equivariance module is trained to predict the representation of a later visit based on the representation from one of the previous visits and the corresponding time interval with a novel regularization loss term while preserving the invariance property to irrelevant image transformations. On a large longitudinal dataset, our model clearly outperforms existing equivariant contrastive methods in predicting progression from intermediate age-related macular degeneration (AMD) to advanced wet-AMD within a specified time-window.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI 2024 (early accept, top 11%)</p></details> |
| **[Get Rid of Task Isolation: A Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10524v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal learning has become a pivotal technique to enable urban intelligence. Traditional spatiotemporal models mostly focus on a specific task by assuming a same distribution between training and testing sets. However, given that urban systems are usually dynamic, multi-sourced with imbalanced data distributions, current specific task-specific models fail to generalize to new urban conditions and adapt to new domains without explicitly modeling interdependencies across various dimensions and types of urban data. To this end, we argue that there is an essential to propose a Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal learning framework (CMuST) to empower collective urban intelligence, which reforms the urban spatiotemporal learning from single-domain to cooperatively multi-dimensional and multi-task learning. Specifically, CMuST proposes a new multi-dimensional spatiotemporal interaction network (MSTI) to allow cross-interactions between context and main observations as well as self-interactions within spatial and temporal aspects to be exposed, which is also the core for capturing task-level commonality and personalization. To ensure continuous task learning, a novel Rolling Adaptation training scheme (RoAda) is devised, which not only preserves task uniqueness by constructing data summarization-driven task prompts, but also harnesses correlated patterns among tasks by iterative model behavior modeling. We further establish a benchmark of three cities for multi-task spatiotemporal learning, and empirically demonstrate the superiority of CMuST via extensive evaluations on these datasets. The impressive improvements on both few-shot streaming data and new domain tasks against existing SOAT methods are achieved.

| **[Will LLMs Replace the Encoder-Only Models in Temporal Relation Classification?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10476v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The automatic detection of temporal relations among events has been mainly investigated with encoder-only models such as RoBERTa. Large Language Models (LLM) have recently shown promising performance in temporal reasoning tasks such as temporal question answering. Nevertheless, recent studies have tested the LLMs' performance in detecting temporal relations of closed-source models only, limiting the interpretability of those results. In this work, we investigate LLMs' performance and decision process in the Temporal Relation Classification task. First, we assess the performance of seven open and closed-sourced LLMs experimenting with in-context learning and lightweight fine-tuning approaches. Results show that LLMs with in-context learning significantly underperform smaller encoder-only models based on RoBERTa. Then, we delve into the possible reasons for this gap by applying explainable methods. The outcome suggests a limitation of LLMs in this task due to their autoregressive nature, which causes them to focus only on the last part of the sequence. Additionally, we evaluate the word embeddings of these two models to better understand their pre-training differences. The code and the fine-tuned models can be found respectively on GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Action Localization for Inertial-based Human Activity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15831v2)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As of today, state-of-the-art activity recognition from wearable sensors relies on algorithms being trained to classify fixed windows of data. In contrast, video-based Human Activity Recognition, known as Temporal Action Localization (TAL), has followed a segment-based prediction approach, localizing activity segments in a timeline of arbitrary length. This paper is the first to systematically demonstrate the applicability of state-of-the-art TAL models for both offline and near-online Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using raw inertial data as well as pre-extracted latent features as input. Offline prediction results show that TAL models are able to outperform popular inertial models on a multitude of HAR benchmark datasets, with improvements reaching as much as 26% in F1-score. We show that by analyzing timelines as a whole, TAL models can produce more coherent segments and achieve higher NULL-class accuracy across all datasets. We demonstrate that TAL is less suited for the immediate classification of small-sized windows of data, yet offers an interesting perspective on inertial-based HAR -- alleviating the need for fixed-size windows and enabling algorithms to recognize activities of arbitrary length. With design choices and training concepts yet to be explored, we argue that TAL architectures could be of significant value to the inertial-based HAR community.

In practical environments with noise-corrupted audio, the role of video information becomes crucial. However, prior works have primarily focused on enhancing audio features in AVSR, overlooking the importance of video features. In this study, we strengthen the video features by learning three temporal dynamics in video data: context order, playback direction, and the speed of video frames. Cross-modal attention modules are introduced to enrich video features with audio information so that speech variability can be taken into account when training on the video temporal dynamics. Based on our approach, we achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the LRS2 and LRS3 AVSR benchmarks for the noise-dominant settings. Our approach excels in scenarios especially for babble and speech noise, indicating the ability to distinguish the speech signal that should be recognized from lip movements in the video modality.

| **[Generative Human Video Compression with Multi-granularity Temporal Trajectory Factorization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10171v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-granularity Temporal Trajectory Factorization framework for generative human video compression, which holds great potential for bandwidth-constrained human-centric video communication. In particular, the proposed motion factorization strategy can facilitate to implicitly characterize the high-dimensional visual signal into compact motion vectors for representation compactness and further transform these vectors into a fine-grained field for motion expressibility. As such, the coded bit-stream can be entailed with enough visual motion information at the lowest representation cost. Meanwhile, a resolution-expandable generative module is developed with enhanced background stability, such that the proposed framework can be optimized towards higher reconstruction robustness and more flexible resolution adaptation. Experimental results show that proposed method outperforms latest generative models and the state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video Coding (VVC) on both talking-face videos and moving-body videos in terms of both objective and subjective quality.

| **[StatioCL: Contrastive Learning for Time Series via Non-Stationary and Temporal Contrast](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10048v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a promising approach for representation learning in time series data by embedding similar pairs closely while distancing dissimilar ones. However, existing CL methods often introduce false negative pairs (FNPs) by neglecting inherent characteristics and then randomly selecting distinct segments as dissimilar pairs, leading to erroneous representation learning, reduced model performance, and overall inefficiency. To address these issues, we systematically define and categorize FNPs in time series into semantic false negative pairs and temporal false negative pairs for the first time: the former arising from overlooking similarities in label categories, which correlates with similarities in non-stationarity and the latter from neglecting temporal proximity. Moreover, we introduce StatioCL, a novel CL framework that captures non-stationarity and temporal dependency to mitigate both FNPs and rectify the inaccuracies in learned representations. By interpreting and differentiating non-stationary states, which reflect the correlation between trends or temporal dynamics with underlying data patterns, StatioCL effectively captures the semantic characteristics and eliminates semantic FNPs. Simultaneously, StatioCL establishes fine-grained similarity levels based on temporal dependencies to capture varying temporal proximity between segments and to mitigate temporal FNPs. Evaluated on real-world benchmark time series classification datasets, StatioCL demonstrates a substantial improvement over state-of-the-art CL methods, achieving a 2.9% increase in Recall and a 19.2% reduction in FNPs. Most importantly, StatioCL also shows enhanced data efficiency and robustness against label scarcity.</p></details> | Accepted in CIKM24 |
| **[Signal Temporal Logic Control Synthesis among Uncontrollable Dynamic Agents with Conformal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04242v2)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The control of dynamical systems under temporal logic specifications among uncontrollable dynamic agents is challenging due to the agents' a-priori unknown behavior. Existing works have considered the problem where either all agents are controllable, the agent models are deterministic and known, or no safety guarantees are provided. We propose a predictive control synthesis framework that guarantees, with high probability, the satisfaction of signal temporal logic (STL) tasks that are defined over a controllable system in the presence of uncontrollable stochastic agents. We use trajectory predictors and conformal prediction to construct probabilistic prediction regions for each uncontrollable agent that are valid over multiple future time steps. Specifically, we construct a normalized prediction region over all agents and time steps to reduce conservatism and increase data efficiency. We then formulate a worst-case bilevel mixed integer program (MIP) that accounts for all agent realizations within the prediction region to obtain an open-loop controller that provably guarantee task satisfaction with high probability. To efficiently solve this bilevel MIP, we propose an equivalent MIP program based on KKT conditions of the original bilevel formulation. Building upon this, we design a closed-loop controller, where both recursive feasibility and task satisfaction can be guaranteed with high probability. We illustrate our control synthesis framework on two case studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bi-temporal Gaussian Feature Dependency Guided Change Detection in Remote Sensing Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09539v1)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Change Detection (CD) enables the identification of alterations between images of the same area captured at different times. However, existing CD methods still struggle to address pseudo changes resulting from domain information differences in multi-temporal images and instances of detail errors caused by the loss and contamination of detail features during the upsampling process in the network. To address this, we propose a bi-temporal Gaussian distribution feature-dependent network (BGFD). Specifically, we first introduce the Gaussian noise domain disturbance (GNDD) module, which approximates distribution using image statistical features to characterize domain information, samples noise to perturb the network for learning redundant domain information, addressing domain information differences from a more fundamental perspective. Additionally, within the feature dependency facilitation (FDF) module, we integrate a novel mutual information difference loss ($L_{MI}$) and more sophisticated attention mechanisms to enhance the capabilities of the network, ensuring the acquisition of essential domain information. Subsequently, we have designed a novel detail feature compensation (DFC) module, which compensates for detail feature loss and contamination introduced during the upsampling process from the perspectives of enhancing local features and refining global features. The BGFD has effectively reduced pseudo changes and enhanced the detection capability of detail information. It has also achieved state-of-the-art performance on four publicly available datasets - DSIFN-CD, SYSU-CD, LEVIR-CD, and S2Looking, surpassing baseline models by +8.58%, +1.28%, +0.31%, and +3.76% respectively, in terms of the F1-Score metric.</p></details> |  |

Scientometrics, the quantitative and qualitative study of scientific literature, provides valuable insights into these processes. We introduce Scito2M, a longitudinal scientometric dataset with over two million academic publications, providing comprehensive contents information and citation graphs to support cross-disciplinary analyses. Using Scito2M, we conduct a temporal study spanning over 30 years to explore key questions in scientometrics: the evolution of academic terminology, citation patterns, and interdisciplinary knowledge exchange. Our findings reveal critical insights, such as disparities in epistemic cultures, knowledge production modes, and citation practices. For example, rapidly developing, application-driven fields like LLMs exhibit significantly shorter citation age (2.48 years) compared to traditional theoretical disciplines like oral history (9.71 years).</p></details> | 19 pages |

However, existing traffic forecasting models still face the following limitations. On one hand, most previous studies either focus too much on real-world geographic information, neglecting the potential traffic correlation between different regions, or overlook geographical position and only model the traffic flow relationship. On the other hand, the importance of different time slices is ignored in time modeling. Therefore, we propose a Fusion Matrix Prompt Enhanced Self-Attention Spatial-Temporal Interactive Traffic Forecasting Framework (FMPESTF), which is composed of spatial and temporal modules for down-sampling traffic data. The network is designed to establish a traffic fusion matrix considering spatial-temporal heterogeneity as a query to reconstruct a data-driven dynamic traffic data structure, which accurately reveal the flow relationship of nodes in the traffic network. In addition, we introduce attention mechanism in time modeling, and design hierarchical spatial-temporal interactive learning to help the model adapt to various traffic scenarios. Through extensive experimental on six real-world traffic datasets, our method is significantly superior to other baseline models, demonstrating its efficiency and accuracy in dealing with traffic forecasting problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>THE W...</summary><p>THE WEB CONFERENCE 2025</p></details> |

We introduce ReasonPlanner, a novel generalist agent designed for reflective thinking, planning, and interactive reasoning. This agent leverages LLMs to plan hypothetical trajectories by building a World Model based on a Temporal Knowledge Graph. The agent interacts with the environment using a natural language actor-critic module, where the actor translates the imagined trajectory into a sequence of actionable steps, and the critic determines if replanning is necessary. ReasonPlanner significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art prompting-based methods on the ScienceWorld benchmark by more than 1.8 times, while being more sample-efficient and interpretable. It relies solely on frozen weights thus requiring no gradient updates. ReasonPlanner can be deployed and utilized without specialized knowledge of Machine Learning, making it accessible to a wide range of users.</p></details> |  |
| **[Meta-Transfer Learning Empowered Temporal Graph Networks for Cross-City Real Estate Appraisal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08947v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real estate appraisal is important for a variety of endeavors such as real estate deals, investment analysis, and real property taxation. Recently, deep learning has shown great promise for real estate appraisal by harnessing substantial online transaction data from web platforms. Nonetheless, deep learning is data-hungry, and thus it may not be trivially applicable to enormous small cities with limited data. To this end, we propose Meta-Transfer Learning Empowered Temporal Graph Networks (MetaTransfer) to transfer valuable knowledge from multiple data-rich metropolises to the data-scarce city to improve valuation performance. Specifically, by modeling the ever-growing real estate transactions with associated residential communities as a temporal event heterogeneous graph, we first design an Event-Triggered Temporal Graph Network to model the irregular spatiotemporal correlations between evolving real estate transactions. Besides, we formulate the city-wide real estate appraisal as a multi-task dynamic graph link label prediction problem, where the valuation of each community in a city is regarded as an individual task. A Hypernetwork-Based Multi-Task Learning module is proposed to simultaneously facilitate intra-city knowledge sharing between multiple communities and task-specific parameters generation to accommodate the community-wise real estate price distribution. Furthermore, we propose a Tri-Level Optimization Based Meta- Learning framework to adaptively re-weight training transaction instances from multiple source cities to mitigate negative transfer, and thus improve the cross-city knowledge transfer effectiveness. Finally, extensive experiments based on five real-world datasets demonstrate the significant superiority of MetaTransfer compared with eleven baseline algorithms.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Dynamic Benchmarks: Spatial and Temporal Alignment for ADS Performance Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08903v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deployed SAE level 4+ Automated Driving Systems (ADS) without a human driver are currently operational ride-hailing fleets on surface streets in the United States. This current use case and future applications of this technology will determine where and when the fleets operate, potentially resulting in a divergence from the distribution of driving of some human benchmark population within a given locality. Existing benchmarks for evaluating ADS performance have only done county-level geographical matching of the ADS and benchmark driving exposure in crash rates. This study presents a novel methodology for constructing dynamic human benchmarks that adjust for spatial and temporal variations in driving distribution between an ADS and the overall human driven fleet. Dynamic benchmarks were generated using human police-reported crash data, human vehicle miles traveled (VMT) data, and over 20 million miles of Waymo's rider-only (RO) operational data accumulated across three US counties. The spatial adjustment revealed significant differences across various severity levels in adjusted crash rates compared to unadjusted benchmarks with these differences ranging from 10% to 47% higher in San Francisco, 12% to 20% higher in Maricopa, and 7% lower to 34% higher in Los Angeles counties. The time-of-day adjustment in San Francisco, limited to this region due to data availability, resulted in adjusted crash rates 2% lower to 16% higher than unadjusted rates, depending on severity level. The findings underscore the importance of adjusting for spatial and temporal confounders in benchmarking analysis, which ultimately contributes to a more equitable benchmark for ADS performance evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporally Consistent Referring Video Object Segmentation with Hybrid Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19407v2)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Video Object Segmentation (R-VOS) methods face challenges in maintaining consistent object segmentation due to temporal context variability and the presence of other visually similar objects. We propose an end-to-end R-VOS paradigm that explicitly models temporal instance consistency alongside the referring segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a novel hybrid memory that facilitates inter-frame collaboration for robust spatio-temporal matching and propagation. Features of frames with automatically generated high-quality reference masks are propagated to segment the remaining frames based on multi-granularity association to achieve temporally consistent R-VOS. Furthermore, we propose a new Mask Consistency Score (MCS) metric to evaluate the temporal consistency of video segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances temporal consistency by a significant margin, leading to top-ranked performance on popular R-VOS benchmarks, i.e., Ref-YouTube-VOS (67.1%) and Ref-DAVIS17 (65.6%).

| **[TIGER: Temporally Improved Graph Entity Linker](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09128v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graphs change over time, for example, when new entities are introduced or entity descriptions change. This impacts the performance of entity linking, a key task in many uses of knowledge graphs such as web search and recommendation. Specifically, entity linking models exhibit temporal degradation - their performance decreases the further a knowledge graph moves from its original state on which an entity linking model was trained. To tackle this challenge, we introduce \textbf{TIGER}: a \textbf{T}emporally \textbf{I}mproved \textbf{G}raph \textbf{E}ntity Linke\textbf{r}. By incorporating structural information between entities into the model, we enhance the learned representation, making entities more distinguishable over time. The core idea is to integrate graph-based information into text-based information, from which both distinct and shared embeddings are based on an entity's feature and structural relationships and their interaction. Experiments on three datasets show that our model can effectively prevent temporal degradation, demonstrating a 16.24\% performance boost over the state-of-the-art in a temporal setting when the time gap is one year and an improvement to 20.93\% as the gap expands to three years. The code and data are made available at \url{https://github.com/pengyu-zhang/TIGER-Temporally-Improved-Graph-Entity-Linker}.</p></details> |  |

We introduce an efficient deep learning model for precipitation nowcasting, capable of predicting rainfall up to 8 hours in advance with greater accuracy than existing operational physics-based and extrapolation-based models. Our model leverages multi-source meteorological data and physics-based forecasts to deliver high-resolution predictions in both time and space. It captures complex spatio-temporal dynamics through temporal attention networks and is optimized using data quality maps and dynamic thresholds. Experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art, and highlight its potential for fast reliable responses to evolving weather conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal point process intensity estimation using zero-deflated subsampling applied to a lightning strikes dataset in France](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11564v2)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cloud-to-ground lightning strikes observed in a specific geographical domain over time can be naturally modeled by a spatio-temporal point process. Our focus lies in the parametric estimation of its intensity function, incorporating both spatial factors (such as altitude) and spatio-temporal covariates (such as field temperature, precipitation, etc.). The events are observed in France over a span of three years. Spatio-temporal covariates are observed with resolution $0.1^\circ \times 0.1^\circ$ ($\approx 100$km$^2$) and six-hour periods. This results in an extensive dataset, further characterized by a significant excess of zeroes (i.e., spatio-temporal cells with no observed events). We reexamine composite likelihood methods commonly employed for spatial point processes, especially in situations where covariates are piecewise constant. Additionally, we extend these methods to account for zero-deflated subsampling, a strategy involving dependent subsampling, with a focus on selecting more cells in regions where events are observed. A simulation study is conducted to illustrate these novel methodologies, followed by their application to the dataset of lightning strikes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Satisfaction of Temporal Logic Constraints in Reinforcement Learning via Adaptive Policy-Switching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08022v1)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) is a subset of machine learning that introduces constraints into the traditional reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Unlike conventional RL which aims solely to maximize cumulative rewards, CRL incorporates additional constraints that represent specific mission requirements or limitations that the agent must comply with during the learning process. In this paper, we address a type of CRL problem where an agent aims to learn the optimal policy to maximize reward while ensuring a desired level of temporal logic constraint satisfaction throughout the learning process. We propose a novel framework that relies on switching between pure learning (reward maximization) and constraint satisfaction. This framework estimates the probability of constraint satisfaction based on earlier trials and properly adjusts the probability of switching between learning and constraint satisfaction policies. We theoretically validate the correctness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its performance and scalability through comprehensive simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Spatio-Temporal Relations in Human-Object Interaction using Pyramid Graph Convolutional Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07912v1)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human activities recognition is an important task for an intelligent robot, especially in the field of human-robot collaboration, it requires not only the label of sub-activities but also the temporal structure of the activity. In order to automatically recognize both the label and the temporal structure in sequence of human-object interaction, we propose a novel Pyramid Graph Convolutional Network (PGCN), which employs a pyramidal encoder-decoder architecture consisting of an attention based graph convolution network and a temporal pyramid pooling module for downsampling and upsampling interaction sequence on the temporal axis, respectively. The system represents the 2D or 3D spatial relation of human and objects from the detection results in video data as a graph. To learn the human-object relations, a new attention graph convolutional network is trained to extract condensed information from the graph representation. To segment action into sub-actions, a novel temporal pyramid pooling module is proposed, which upsamples compressed features back to the original time scale and classifies actions per frame. We explore various attention layers, namely spatial attention, temporal attention and channel attention, and combine different upsampling decoders to test the performance on action recognition and segmentation. We evaluate our model on two challenging datasets in the field of human-object interaction recognition, i.e. Bimanual Actions and IKEA Assembly datasets. We demonstrate that our classifier significantly improves both framewise action recognition and segmentation, e.g., F1 micro and F1@50 scores on Bimanual Actions dataset are improved by $4.3\%$ and $8.5\%$ respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, IROS 2022 conference</p></details> |

While current deep learning-based desnowing approaches achieve success on synthetic benchmark datasets, they struggle to restore out-of-distribution real-world snowy videos due to the deficiency of paired real-world training data. To address this bottleneck, we devise a new paradigm for video desnowing in a semi-supervised spirit to involve unlabeled real data for the generalizable snow removal. Specifically, we construct a real-world dataset with 85 snowy videos, and then present a Semi-supervised Video Desnowing Network (SemiVDN) equipped by a novel Distribution-driven Contrastive Regularization. The elaborated contrastive regularization mitigates the distribution gap between the synthetic and real data, and consequently maintains the desired snow-invariant background details. Furthermore, based on the atmospheric scattering model, we introduce a Prior-guided Temporal Decoupling Experts module to decompose the physical components that make up a snowy video in a frame-correlated manner. We evaluate our SemiVDN on benchmark datasets and the collected real snowy data. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach against state-of-the-art image- and video-level desnowing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Markov Decision Processes under External Temporal Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16056v3)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most reinforcement learning algorithms treat the context under which they operate as a stationary, isolated, and undisturbed environment. However, in real world applications, environments constantly change due to a variety of external events. To address this problem, we study Markov Decision Processes (MDP) under the influence of an external temporal process. First, we formalize this notion and derive conditions under which the problem becomes tractable with suitable solutions. We propose a policy iteration algorithm to solve this problem and theoretically analyze its performance. Our analysis addresses the non-stationarity present in the MDP as a result of non-Markovian events, necessitating the formulation of policies that are contingent upon both the current state and a history of prior events. Additionally, we derive insights regarding the sample complexity of the algorithm and incorporate factors that define the exogenous temporal process into the established bounds. Finally, we perform experiments to demonstrate our findings within a traditional control environment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal-Difference Variational Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07812v1)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A crucial capability of Machine Learning models in real-world applications is the ability to continuously learn new tasks. This adaptability allows them to respond to potentially inevitable shifts in the data-generating distribution over time. However, in Continual Learning (CL) settings, models often struggle to balance learning new tasks (plasticity) with retaining previous knowledge (memory stability). Consequently, they are susceptible to Catastrophic Forgetting, which degrades performance and undermines the reliability of deployed systems. Variational Continual Learning methods tackle this challenge by employing a learning objective that recursively updates the posterior distribution and enforces it to stay close to the latest posterior estimate. Nonetheless, we argue that these methods may be ineffective due to compounding approximation errors over successive recursions. To mitigate this, we propose new learning objectives that integrate the regularization effects of multiple previous posterior estimations, preventing individual errors from dominating future posterior updates and compounding over time. We reveal insightful connections between these objectives and Temporal-Difference methods, a popular learning mechanism in Reinforcement Learning and Neuroscience. We evaluate the proposed objectives on challenging versions of popular CL benchmarks, demonstrating that they outperform standard Variational CL methods and non-variational baselines, effectively alleviating Catastrophic Forgetting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gridded Transformer Neural Processes for Large Unstructured Spatio-Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06731v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many important problems require modelling large-scale spatio-temporal datasets, with one prevalent example being weather forecasting. Recently, transformer-based approaches have shown great promise in a range of weather forecasting problems. However, these have mostly focused on gridded data sources, neglecting the wealth of unstructured, off-the-grid data from observational measurements such as those at weather stations. A promising family of models suitable for such tasks are neural processes (NPs), notably the family of transformer neural processes (TNPs). Although TNPs have shown promise on small spatio-temporal datasets, they are unable to scale to the quantities of data used by state-of-the-art weather and climate models. This limitation stems from their lack of efficient attention mechanisms. We address this shortcoming through the introduction of gridded pseudo-token TNPs which employ specialised encoders and decoders to handle unstructured observations and utilise a processor containing gridded pseudo-tokens that leverage efficient attention mechanisms. Our method consistently outperforms a range of strong baselines on various synthetic and real-world regression tasks involving large-scale data, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. The real-life experiments are performed on weather data, demonstrating the potential of our approach to bring performance and computational benefits when applied at scale in a weather modelling pipeline.</p></details> |  |
| **[G$^{2}$TR: Generalized Grounded Temporal Reasoning for Robot Instruction Following by Combining Large Pre-trained Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07494v1)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consider the scenario where a human cleans a table and a robot observing the scene is instructed with the task "Remove the cloth using which I wiped the table". Instruction following with temporal reasoning requires the robot to identify the relevant past object interaction, ground the object of interest in the present scene, and execute the task according to the human's instruction. Directly grounding utterances referencing past interactions to grounded objects is challenging due to the multi-hop nature of references to past interactions and large space of object groundings in a video stream observing the robot's workspace. Our key insight is to factor the temporal reasoning task as (i) estimating the video interval associated with event reference, (ii) performing spatial reasoning over the interaction frames to infer the intended object (iii) semantically track the object's location till the current scene to enable future robot interactions. Our approach leverages existing large pre-trained models (which possess inherent generalization capabilities) and combines them appropriately for temporal grounding tasks. Evaluation on a video-language corpus acquired with a robot manipulator displaying rich temporal interactions in spatially-complex scenes displays an average accuracy of 70.10%. The dataset, code, and videos are available at https://reail-iitdelhi.github.io/temporalreasoning.github.io/ .</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Representation Learning in Temporal Data via Single-Parent Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07013v1)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific research often seeks to understand the causal structure underlying high-level variables in a system. For example, climate scientists study how phenomena, such as El Ni\~no, affect other climate processes at remote locations across the globe. However, scientists typically collect low-level measurements, such as geographically distributed temperature readings. From these, one needs to learn both a mapping to causally-relevant latent variables, such as a high-level representation of the El Ni\~no phenomenon and other processes, as well as the causal model over them. The challenge is that this task, called causal representation learning, is highly underdetermined from observational data alone, requiring other constraints during learning to resolve the indeterminacies. In this work, we consider a temporal model with a sparsity assumption, namely single-parent decoding: each observed low-level variable is only affected by a single latent variable. Such an assumption is reasonable in many scientific applications that require finding groups of low-level variables, such as extracting regions from geographically gridded measurement data in climate research or capturing brain regions from neural activity data. We demonstrate the identifiability of the resulting model and propose a differentiable method, Causal Discovery with Single-parent Decoding (CDSD), that simultaneously learns the underlying latents and a causal graph over them. We assess the validity of our theoretical results using simulated data and showcase the practical validity of our method in an application to real-world data from the climate science field.</p></details> | 33 pages, 17 figures |

Enhanced by anthropogenic activities and global warming, cyanobacterial blooms are expected to increase in frequency and global distribution. Early warning systems (EWS) for cyanobacterial blooms development allow timely implementation of management measures, reducing the risks associated to these blooms. In this paper, we propose an effective EWS for cyanobacterial bloom forecasting, which uses 6 years of incomplete high-frequency spatio-temporal data from multiparametric probes, including phycocyanin (PC) fluorescence as a proxy for cyanobacteria. A probe agnostic and replicable method is proposed to pre-process the data and to generate time series specific for cyanobacterial bloom forecasting. Using these pre-processed data, six different non-site/species-specific predictive models were compared including the autoregressive and multivariate versions of Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Long-Term Short-Term (LSTM) neural networks. Results were analyzed for seven forecasting time horizons ranging from 4 to 28 days evaluated with a hybrid system that combined regression metrics (MSE, R2, MAPE) for PC values, classification metrics (Accuracy, F1, Kappa) for a proposed alarm level of 10 ug PC/L, and a forecasting-specific metric to measure prediction improvement over the displaced signal (skill). The multivariate version of LSTM showed the best and most consistent results across all forecasting horizons and metrics, achieving accuracies of up to 90% in predicting the proposed PC alarm level. Additionally, positive skill values indicated its outstanding effectiveness to forecast cyanobacterial blooms from 16 to 28 days in advance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning from Spatio-temporal Correlation for Semi-Supervised LiDAR Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06893v1)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the challenges of the semi-supervised LiDAR segmentation (SSLS) problem, particularly in low-budget scenarios. The two main issues in low-budget SSLS are the poor-quality pseudo-labels for unlabeled data, and the performance drops due to the significant imbalance between ground-truth and pseudo-labels. This imbalance leads to a vicious training cycle. To overcome these challenges, we leverage the spatio-temporal prior by recognizing the substantial overlap between temporally adjacent LiDAR scans. We propose a proximity-based label estimation, which generates highly accurate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data by utilizing semantic consistency with adjacent labeled data. Additionally, we enhance this method by progressively expanding the pseudo-labels from the nearest unlabeled scans, which helps significantly reduce errors linked to dynamic classes. Additionally, we employ a dual-branch structure to mitigate performance degradation caused by data imbalance. Experimental results demonstrate remarkable performance in low-budget settings (i.e., <= 5%) and meaningful improvements in normal budget settings (i.e., 5 - 50%). Finally, our method has achieved new state-of-the-art results on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes in semi-supervised LiDAR segmentation. With only 5% labeled data, it offers competitive results against fully-supervised counterparts. Moreover, it surpasses the performance of the previous state-of-the-art at 100% labeled data (75.2%) using only 20% of labeled data (76.0%) on nuScenes. The code is available on https://github.com/halbielee/PLE.</p></details> |  |

Proton Electrolyte Membrane Water Electrolysis (PEMWE) is a key technology for the production of green hydrogen under fluctuating conditions of renewable power sources. However, due to the scarcity of noble metal materials, the stability of the anode catalyst layer under dynamic operating conditions must be better understood. Model-aided investigation approaches are essential due to the back-box nature of the electrochemical system and the high costs of experimental long-term testing. In this work, a temporal multiscale method based on a Heterogeneous technique is applied to reduce the computational effort of simulating long-term degradation, focused on catalyst dissolution. Such an approach characterizes the problem in fast locally periodic processes, influenced by the dynamic operation and slow processes attributed to the gradual degradation of the catalyst layer. A mechanistic model that includes the oxygen evolution reaction, catalyst dissolution and hydrogen permeation from the cathode to the anode side is hypothesized and implemented. The multiscale approach notably reduces computational effort of simulation from hours to mere minutes. This efficiency gain is ascribed to the limited evolution of Slow-Scale variables during each period of time of the Fast-Scale variables. Consequently, simulation of the fast processes is required only until local periodicity is achieved within each Slow-Scale time step. Thus, the developed temporal multiscale approach proves to be highly effective in accelerating parameter estimation and predictive simulation steps, as could be verified through the results of this article. In this way, the method can support systematic model development to describe degradation in PEMWE under dynamic operating conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 9 figures, acknowledgements are provided</p></details> |

Our approach draws inspiration from Reinforcement Learning principles, particularly the Deep Q-Network paradigm, extending Temporal Learning concepts to Survival Regression. A central idea in our method is temporal consistency, a hypothesis that past and future outcomes in the data evolve smoothly over time. Our framework uniquely incorporates temporal consistency into large datasets by providing a stable training signal that captures long-term temporal relationships and ensures reliable updates. Additionally, the method supports arbitrarily complex architectures, enabling the modeling of intricate temporal dependencies, and allows for end-to-end training. Through numerous experiments we provide empirical evidence demonstrating our framework's ability to exploit temporal consistency across datasets of varying sizes. Moreover, our algorithm outperforms benchmarks on datasets with long sequences, demonstrating its ability to capture long-term patterns. Finally, ablation studies show how our method enhances training stability.</p></details> |  |

| **[Efficient representation learning of scintillation signal characteristics with spectrum-inspired temporal neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07267v1)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nuclear radiation detectors based on scintillators are widely used in particle and high energy physics experiments, nuclear medicine imaging, industrial and environmental detection, etc. Precisely extracting scintillation signal characteristics at the event level is important for these applications, not only in respect of understanding the scintillator itself, but also kinds and physical property of incident particles. Recent researches demonstrate data-driven neural networks are superior to traditional statistical methods, especially when the analytical form of signals is hard to obtain, or noise is significant. However, most densely connected or convolution-based networks fail to fully exploit the spectral and temporal structure of scintillation signals, leaving large space for performance improvement. In this paper, we propose a network architecture specially tailored for scintillation signal characterization based on previous works on time series analysis. By directly applying Fast Fourier Transform on original signals without data embedding, including the zero-frequency component, adjusting convolution scheme for low-frequency components, and unbiasedly re-weighting features from different frequencies, the proposed network architecture can serve as a lightweight and enhanced representation learning backbone. We prove our idea on simulation data generated with the setting of the LUX dark matter detector, and on experimental electrical signals with fast electronics to emulate scintillation variations. The proposed model achieves significantly better results than the reference model in literature and densely connected models without representation learning.</p></details> | 24 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Language-Assisted Human Part Motion Learning for Skeleton-Based Temporal Action Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06353v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Skeleton-based Temporal Action Segmentation involves the dense action classification of variable-length skeleton sequences. Current approaches primarily apply graph-based networks to extract framewise, whole-body-level motion representations, and use one-hot encoded labels for model optimization. However, whole-body motion representations do not capture fine-grained part-level motion representations and the one-hot encoded labels neglect the intrinsic semantic relationships within the language-based action definitions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method named Language-assisted Human Part Motion Representation Learning (LPL), which contains a Disentangled Part Motion Encoder (DPE) to extract dual-level (i.e., part and whole-body) motion representations and a Language-assisted Distribution Alignment (LDA) strategy for optimizing spatial relations within representations. Specifically, after part-aware skeleton encoding via DPE, LDA generates dual-level action descriptions to construct a textual embedding space with the help of a large-scale language model. Then, LDA motivates the alignment of the embedding space between text descriptions and motions. This alignment allows LDA not only to enhance intra-class compactness but also to transfer the language-encoded semantic correlations among actions to skeleton-based motion learning. Moreover, we propose a simple yet efficient Semantic Offset Adapter to smooth the cross-domain misalignment. Our experiments indicate that LPL achieves state-of-the-art performance across various datasets (e.g., +4.4\% Accuracy, +5.6\% F1 on the PKU-MMD dataset). Moreover, LDA is compatible with existing methods and improves their performance (e.g., +4.8\% Accuracy, +4.3\% F1 on the LARa dataset) without additional inference costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

These approaches have recently been adapted to earth observation data, but they are only able to handle single image inputs, limiting their use for many real-world tasks. In this work, we develop a new vision and language assistant called TEOChat that can engage in conversations about temporal sequences of earth observation data. To train TEOChat, we curate an instruction-following dataset composed of many single image and temporal tasks including building change and damage assessment, semantic change detection, and temporal scene classification. We show that TEOChat can perform a wide variety of spatial and temporal reasoning tasks, substantially outperforming previous vision and language assistants, and even achieving comparable or better performance than specialist models trained to perform these specific tasks. Furthermore, TEOChat achieves impressive zero-shot performance on a change detection and change question answering dataset, outperforms GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro on multiple temporal tasks, and exhibits stronger single image capabilities than a comparable single EO image instruction-following model. We publicly release our data, models, and code at https://github.com/ermongroup/TEOChat .</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Reasoning Transfer from Text to Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06166v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in video comprehension, yet they struggle with tracking temporal changes and reasoning about temporal relationships. While previous research attributed this limitation to the ineffective temporal encoding of visual inputs, our diagnostic study reveals that video representations contain sufficient information for even small probing classifiers to achieve perfect accuracy. Surprisingly, we find that the key bottleneck in Video LLMs' temporal reasoning capability stems from the underlying LLM's inherent difficulty with temporal concepts, as evidenced by poor performance on textual temporal question-answering tasks. Building on this discovery, we introduce the Textual Temporal reasoning Transfer (T3). T3 synthesizes diverse temporal reasoning tasks in pure text format from existing image-text datasets, addressing the scarcity of video samples with complex temporal scenarios. Remarkably, without using any video data, T3 enhances LongVA-7B's temporal understanding, yielding a 5.3 absolute accuracy improvement on the challenging TempCompass benchmark, which enables our model to outperform ShareGPT4Video-8B trained on 28,000 video samples. Additionally, the enhanced LongVA-7B model achieves competitive performance on comprehensive video benchmarks. For example, it achieves a 49.7 accuracy on the Temporal Reasoning task of Video-MME, surpassing powerful large-scale models such as InternVL-Chat-V1.5-20B and VILA1.5-40B. Further analysis reveals a strong correlation between textual and video temporal task performance, validating the efficacy of transferring temporal reasoning abilities from text to video domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://video-t3.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models Can Learn Temporal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06853v6)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities, they are not without their flaws and inaccuracies. Recent studies have introduced various methods to mitigate these limitations. Temporal reasoning (TR), in particular, presents a significant challenge for LLMs due to its reliance on diverse temporal concepts and intricate temporal logic. In this paper, we propose TG-LLM, a novel framework towards language-based TR. Instead of reasoning over the original context, we adopt a latent representation, temporal graph (TG) that enhances the learning of TR. A synthetic dataset (TGQA), which is fully controllable and requires minimal supervision, is constructed for fine-tuning LLMs on this text-to-TG translation task. We confirmed in experiments that the capability of TG translation learned on our dataset can be transferred to other TR tasks and benchmarks. On top of that, we teach LLM to perform deliberate reasoning over the TGs via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) bootstrapping and graph data augmentation. We observed that those strategies, which maintain a balance between usefulness and diversity, bring more reliable CoTs and final results than the vanilla CoT distillation.</p></details> | ACL24 (main) |

Most previous methods formulate this task as single-frame-based instance segmentation while ignoring the natural temporal and stereo attributes of a surgical video. As a result, these methods are less robust against the appearance variation through temporal motion and view change. In this work, we propose a novel LACOSTE model that exploits Location-Agnostic COntexts in Stereo and TEmporal images for improved surgical instrument segmentation. Leveraging a query-based segmentation model as core, we design three performance-enhancing modules. Firstly, we design a disparity-guided feature propagation module to enhance depth-aware features explicitly. To generalize well for even only a monocular video, we apply a pseudo stereo scheme to generate complementary right images. Secondly, we propose a stereo-temporal set classifier, which aggregates stereo-temporal contexts in a universal way for making a consolidated prediction and mitigates transient failures. Finally, we propose a location-agnostic classifier to decouple the location bias from mask prediction and enhance the feature semantics. We extensively validate our approach on three public surgical video datasets, including two benchmarks from EndoVis Challenges and one real radical prostatectomy surgery dataset GraSP. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performances of our method, which consistently achieves comparable or favorable results with previous state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to Medical Image Analysis</p></details> |
| **[Grounding is All You Need? Dual Temporal Grounding for Video Dialog](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05767v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of video dialog response generation, the understanding of video content and the temporal nuances of conversation history are paramount. While a segment of current research leans heavily on large-scale pretrained visual-language models and often overlooks temporal dynamics, another delves deep into spatial-temporal relationships within videos but demands intricate object trajectory pre-extractions and sidelines dialog temporal dynamics. This paper introduces the Dual Temporal Grounding-enhanced Video Dialog model (DTGVD), strategically designed to merge the strengths of both dominant approaches. It emphasizes dual temporal relationships by predicting dialog turn-specific temporal regions, filtering video content accordingly, and grounding responses in both video and dialog contexts. One standout feature of DTGVD is its heightened attention to chronological interplay. By recognizing and acting upon the dependencies between different dialog turns, it captures more nuanced conversational dynamics. To further bolster the alignment between video and dialog temporal dynamics, we've implemented a list-wise contrastive learning strategy. Within this framework, accurately grounded turn-clip pairings are designated as positive samples, while less precise pairings are categorized as negative. This refined classification is then funneled into our holistic end-to-end response generation mechanism. Evaluations using AVSD@DSTC-7 and AVSD@DSTC-8 datasets underscore the superiority of our methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Temporal Modeling of Video LLMs via Time Gating](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05714v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on video-and-language tasks, such as video question answering. However, most existing Video LLMs neglect temporal information in video data, leading to struggles with temporal-aware video understanding. To address this gap, we propose a Time Gating Video LLM (TG-Vid) designed to enhance temporal modeling through a novel Time Gating module (TG). The TG module employs a time gating mechanism on its sub-modules, comprising gating spatial attention, gating temporal attention, and gating MLP. This architecture enables our model to achieve a robust understanding of temporal information within videos. Extensive evaluation of temporal-sensitive video benchmarks (i.e., MVBench, TempCompass, and NExT-QA) demonstrates that our TG-Vid model significantly outperforms the existing Video LLMs. Further, comprehensive ablation studies validate that the performance gains are attributed to the designs of our TG module.

| **[TRACE: Temporal Grounding Video LLM via Causal Event Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05643v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) is a crucial capability for video understanding models and plays a vital role in downstream tasks such as video browsing and editing. To effectively handle various tasks simultaneously and enable zero-shot prediction, there is a growing trend in employing video LLMs for VTG tasks. However, current video LLM-based methods rely exclusively on natural language generation, lacking the ability to model the clear structure inherent in videos, which restricts their effectiveness in tackling VTG tasks. To address this issue, this paper first formally introduces causal event modeling framework, which represents videos as sequences of events, and predict the current event using previous events, video inputs, and textural instructions. Each event consists of three components: timestamps, salient scores, and textual captions. We then propose a novel task-interleaved video LLM called TRACE to effectively implement the causal event modeling framework in practice. The TRACE processes visual frames, timestamps, salient scores, and text as distinct tasks, employing various encoders and decoding heads for each. Task tokens are arranged in an interleaved sequence according to the causal event modeling framework's formulation. Extensive experiments on various VTG tasks and datasets demonstrate the superior performance of TRACE compared to state-of-the-art video LLMs. Our model and code are available at \url{https://github.com/gyxxyg/TRACE}.</p></details> |  |

We employ a data augmentation technique by expanding the training dataset using overlapping labels from the Something-SomethingV2 dataset, enhancing the model's ability to generalize across various action classes. For feature extraction, we utilize state-of-the-art models, including UMT, VideoMAEv2 for video features, and BEATs and CAV-MAE for audio features. Our approach involves training both multimodal (video and audio) and unimodal (video only) models, followed by combining their predictions using the Weighted Box Fusion (WBF) method. This fusion strategy ensures robust action localisation. our overall approach achieves a score of 0.5498, securing first place in the competition.</p></details> |  |

Though large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in many reasoning tasks, temporal reasoning remains challenging due to its intrinsic complexity. In this work, we first study an essential task of temporal reasoning -- temporal graph generation, to unveil LLMs' inherent, global reasoning capabilities. We show that this task presents great challenges even for the most powerful LLMs, such as GPT-3.5/4. We also notice a significant performance gap by small models (<10B) that lag behind LLMs by 50%. Next, we study how to close this gap with a budget constraint, e.g., not using model finetuning. We propose a new prompting technique tailored for temporal reasoning, Narrative-of-Thought (NoT), that first converts the events set to a Python class, then prompts a small model to generate a temporally grounded narrative, guiding the final generation of a temporal graph. Extensive experiments showcase the efficacy of NoT in improving various metrics. Notably, NoT attains the highest F1 on the Schema-11 evaluation set, while securing an overall F1 on par with GPT-3.5. NoT also achieves the best structural similarity across the board, even compared with GPT-3.5/4. Our code is available at https://github.com/launchnlp/NoT.</p></details> | EMNLP'24 Findings |

The proposed algorithm, Distributed Hebbian Temporal Memory (DHTM), is based on factor graph formalism and a multicomponent neuron model. DHTM aims to capture sequential data relationships and make cumulative predictions about future observations, forming Successor Features (SF). Inspired by neurophysiological models of the neocortex, the algorithm utilizes distributed representations, sparse transition matrices, and local Hebbian-like learning rules to overcome the instability and slow learning process of traditional temporal memory algorithms like RNN and HMM. Experimental results demonstrate that DHTM outperforms LSTM and a biologically inspired HMM-like algorithm, CSCG, in the case of non-stationary datasets. Our findings suggest that DHTM is a promising approach for addressing the challenges of online sequence learning and planning in dynamic environments.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

ComplexTempQA significantly surpasses existing benchmarks like HOTPOTQA, TORQUE, and TEQUILA in scale and scope. Utilizing data from Wikipedia and Wikidata, the dataset covers questions spanning over two decades and offers an unmatched breadth of topics. We introduce a unique taxonomy that categorizes questions as attributes, comparisons, and counting questions, each revolving around events, entities, and time periods. One standout feature of ComplexTempQA is the high complexity of its questions, which demand effective capabilities for answering such as across-time comparison, temporal aggregation, and multi-hop reasoning involving temporal event ordering and entity recognition. Additionally, each question is accompanied by detailed metadata, including specific time scopes, allowing for comprehensive evaluation and enhancement of the temporal reasoning abilities of large language models. ComplexTempQA serves both as a testing ground for developing sophisticated AI models and as a foundation for advancing research in question answering, information retrieval, and language understanding.</p></details> |  |

| **[PredFormer: Transformers Are Effective Spatial-Temporal Predictive Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04733v1)** | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal predictive learning methods generally fall into two categories: recurrent-based approaches, which face challenges in parallelization and performance, and recurrent-free methods, which employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as encoder-decoder architectures. These methods benefit from strong inductive biases but often at the expense of scalability and generalization. This paper proposes PredFormer, a pure transformer-based framework for spatiotemporal predictive learning. Motivated by the Vision Transformers (ViT) design, PredFormer leverages carefully designed Gated Transformer blocks, following a comprehensive analysis of 3D attention mechanisms, including full-, factorized-, and interleaved- spatial-temporal attention. With its recurrent-free, transformer-based design, PredFormer is both simple and efficient, significantly outperforming previous methods by large margins. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that PredFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance. On Moving MNIST, PredFormer achieves a 51.3% reduction in MSE relative to SimVP. For TaxiBJ, the model decreases MSE by 33.1% and boosts FPS from 533 to 2364. Additionally, on WeatherBench, it reduces MSE by 11.1% while enhancing FPS from 196 to 404. These performance gains in both accuracy and efficiency demonstrate PredFormer's potential for real-world applications. The source code will be released at https://github.com/yyyujintang/PredFormer.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |

However, previous delay predictions are often categorical and at a highly aggregated level. To improve that, this study proposes to apply the novel Temporal Fusion Transformer model and predict numerical airport arrival delays at quarter hour level for U.S. top 30 airports. Inputs to our model include airport demand and capacity forecasts, historic airport operation efficiency information, airport wind and visibility conditions, as well as enroute weather and traffic conditions. The results show that our model achieves satisfactory performance measured by small prediction errors on the test set. In addition, the interpretability analysis of the model outputs identifies the important input factors for delay prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accurate and Fast Estimation of Temporal Motifs using Path Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08975v2)** | 2024-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Counting the number of small subgraphs, called motifs, is a fundamental problem in social network analysis and graph mining. Many real-world networks are directed and temporal, where edges have timestamps. Motif counting in directed, temporal graphs is especially challenging because there are a plethora of different kinds of patterns. Temporal motif counts reveal much richer information and there is a need for scalable algorithms for motif counting. A major challenge in counting is that there can be trillions of temporal motif matches even with a graph with only millions of vertices. Both the motifs and the input graphs can have multiple edges between two vertices, leading to a combinatorial explosion problem. Counting temporal motifs involving just four vertices is not feasible with current state-of-the-art algorithms. We design an algorithm, TEACUPS, that addresses this problem using a novel technique of temporal path sampling. We combine a path sampling method with carefully designed temporal data structures, to propose an efficient approximate algorithm for temporal motif counting. TEACUPS is an unbiased estimator with provable concentration behavior, which can be used to bound the estimation error. For a Bitcoin graph with hundreds of millions of edges, TEACUPS runs in less than 1 minute, while the exact counting algorithm takes more than a day. We empirically demonstrate the accuracy of TEACUPS on large datasets, showing an average of 30$\times$ speedup (up to 2000$\times$ speedup) compared to existing GPU-based exact counting methods while preserving high count estimation accuracy.</p></details> | Accepted in ICDM'24 |
| **[Mental Disorder Classification via Temporal Representation of Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15470v2)** | 2024-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mental disorders pose a global challenge, aggravated by the shortage of qualified mental health professionals. Mental disorder prediction from social media posts by current LLMs is challenging due to the complexities of sequential text data and the limited context length of language models. Current language model-based approaches split a single data instance into multiple chunks to compensate for limited context size. The predictive model is then applied to each chunk individually, and the most voted output is selected as the final prediction. This results in the loss of inter-post dependencies and important time variant information, leading to poor performance. We propose a novel framework which first compresses the large sequence of chronologically ordered social media posts into a series of numbers. We then use this time variant representation for mental disorder classification. We demonstrate the generalization capabilities of our framework by outperforming the current SOTA in three different mental conditions: depression, self-harm, and anorexia, with an absolute improvement of 5% in the F1 score. We investigate the situation where current data instances fall within the context length of language models and present empirical results highlighting the importance of temporal properties of textual data. Furthermore, we utilize the proposed framework for a cross-domain study, exploring commonalities across disorders and the possibility of inter-domain data usage.</p></details> | <details><summary>RK an...</summary><p>RK and KM contributed equally to this work, 15 pages, 5 figures, 9 table</p></details> |
| **[NarrativeBridge: Enhancing Video Captioning with Causal-Temporal Narrative](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06499v2)** | 2024-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing video captioning benchmarks and models lack coherent representations of causal-temporal narrative, which is sequences of events linked through cause and effect, unfolding over time and driven by characters or agents. This lack of narrative restricts models' ability to generate text descriptions that capture the causal and temporal dynamics inherent in video content. To address this gap, we propose NarrativeBridge, an approach comprising of: (1) a novel Causal-Temporal Narrative (CTN) captions benchmark generated using a large language model and few-shot prompting, explicitly encoding cause-effect temporal relationships in video descriptions, evaluated automatically to ensure caption quality and relevance and validated through human evaluation; and (2) a dedicated Cause-Effect Network (CEN) architecture with separate encoders for capturing cause and effect dynamics independently, enabling effective learning and generation of captions with causal-temporal narrative. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CEN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, including fine-tuned vision-language models, and is more accurate in articulating the causal and temporal aspects of video content than the second best model (GIT): 17.88 and 17.44 CIDEr on the MSVD and MSR-VTT datasets, respectively. Cross-dataset evaluations further showcase CEN's strong generalization capabilities. The proposed framework understands and generates nuanced text descriptions with intricate causal-temporal narrative structures present in videos, addressing a critical limitation in video captioning.</p></details> |  |

To facilitate the automatic exploration of these differences, we propose a novel system that compares in a systematic way the outputs of two LLM versions based on user-defined queries. The system first generates a hierarchical topic structure rooted in a user-specified keyword, allowing for an organized comparison of topical categories. Subsequently, it evaluates the generated text by both LLMs to identify differences in vocabulary, information presentation, and underlying themes. This fully automated approach not only streamlines the identification of shifts in public opinion and cultural norms but also enhances our understanding of the adaptability and robustness of machine learning applications in response to temporal changes. By fostering research in continual model adaptation and comparative summarization, this work contributes to the development of more transparent machine learning models capable of capturing the nuances of evolving societal contexts.</p></details> |  |

Different from the common penalty-based approach, this work promotes adherence to the underlying physical mechanism that facilitates statistical procedures. The motivating application concerns modeling fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, which is used for characterization of diffusion processes. We propose a physics-encoded regression model for handling spatio-temporally distributed data, which enables principled interpretability, parsimonious computation and efficient estimation by exploiting the structure of solutions of a governing evolution equation. The rate of convergence attaining the minimax optimality is theoretically demonstrated, generalizing the result obtained for the spatial regression.

| **[Improving Temporal Link Prediction via Temporal Walk Matrix Projection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04013v1)** | 2024-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal link prediction, aiming at predicting future interactions among entities based on historical interactions, is crucial for a series of real-world applications. Although previous methods have demonstrated the importance of relative encodings for effective temporal link prediction, computational efficiency remains a major concern in constructing these encodings. Moreover, existing relative encodings are usually constructed based on structural connectivity, where temporal information is seldom considered. To address the aforementioned issues, we first analyze existing relative encodings and unify them as a function of temporal walk matrices. This unification establishes a connection between relative encodings and temporal walk matrices, providing a more principled way for analyzing and designing relative encodings. Based on this analysis, we propose a new temporal graph neural network called TPNet, which introduces a temporal walk matrix that incorporates the time decay effect to simultaneously consider both temporal and structural information. Moreover, TPNet designs a random feature propagation mechanism with theoretical guarantees to implicitly maintain the temporal walk matrices, which improves the computation and storage efficiency. Experimental results on 13 benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness and efficiency of TPNet, where TPNet outperforms other baselines on most datasets and achieves a maximum speedup of $33.3 \times$ compared to the SOTA baseline.

| **[SDA-GRIN for Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Multivariate Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03954v1)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In various applications, the multivariate time series often suffers from missing data. This issue can significantly disrupt systems that rely on the data. Spatial and temporal dependencies can be leveraged to impute the missing samples. Existing imputation methods often ignore dynamic changes in spatial dependencies. We propose a Spatial Dynamic Aware Graph Recurrent Imputation Network (SDA-GRIN) which is capable of capturing dynamic changes in spatial dependencies.SDA-GRIN leverages a multi-head attention mechanism to adapt graph structures with time. SDA-GRIN models multivariate time series as a sequence of temporal graphs and uses a recurrent message-passing architecture for imputation. We evaluate SDA-GRIN on four real-world datasets: SDA-GRIN improves MSE by 9.51% for the AQI and 9.40% for AQI-36. On the PEMS-BAY dataset, it achieves a 1.94% improvement in MSE. Detailed ablation study demonstrates the effect of window sizes and missing data on the performance of the method. Project page:https://ameskandari.github.io/sda-grin/</p></details> |  |

However, long video understanding presents unique challenges due to the complexity of reasoning over extended timespans, even for zero-shot LLM-based approaches. The challenge of information redundancy in long videos prompts the question of what specific information is essential for large language models (LLMs) and how to leverage them for complex spatial-temporal reasoning in long-form video analysis. We propose a framework VideoINSTA, i.e. INformative Spatial-TemporAl Reasoning for zero-shot long-form video understanding. VideoINSTA contributes (1) a zero-shot framework for long video understanding using LLMs; (2) an event-based temporal reasoning and content-based spatial reasoning approach for LLMs to reason over spatial-temporal information in videos; (3) a self-reflective information reasoning scheme balancing temporal factors based on information sufficiency and prediction confidence. Our model significantly improves the state-of-the-art on three long video question-answering benchmarks: EgoSchema, NextQA, and IntentQA, and the open question answering dataset ActivityNetQA.

| **[Modeling and Analysis of Spatial and Temporal Land Clutter Statistics in SAR Imaging Based on MSTAR Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03816v1)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The statistical analysis of land clutter for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging has become an increasingly important subject for research and investigation. It is also absolutely necessary for designing robust algorithms capable of performing the task of target detection in the background clutter. Any attempt to extract the energy of the desired targets from the land clutter requires complete knowledge of the statistical properties of the background clutter. In this paper, the spatial as well as the temporal characteristics of the land clutter are studied. Since the data for each image has been collected based on a different aspect angle; therefore, the temporal analysis contains variation in the aspect angle. Consequently, the temporal analysis includes the characteristics of the radar cross section with respect to the aspect angle based on which the data has been collected. In order to perform the statistical analysis, several well-known and relevant distributions, namely, Weibull, Log-normal, Gamma, and Rayleigh are considered as prime candidates to model the land clutter. The goodness-of-fit test is based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence metric. The detailed analysis presented in this paper demonstrates that the Weibull distribution is a more accurate fit for the temporal-aspect-angle statistical analysis while the Rayleigh distribution models the spatial characteristics of the background clutter with higher accuracy. Finally, based on the aforementioned statistical analyses and by utilizing the Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) algorithm, we perform target detection in land clutter. The overall verification of the analysis is performed by exploiting the Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) data-set, which has been collected in spotlight mode at X-band, and the results are presented.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2409.02155</p></details> |
| **[Language Model Empowered Spatio-Temporal Forecasting via Physics-Aware Reprogramming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14505v2)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is pivotal in numerous real-world applications, including transportation planning, energy management, and climate monitoring. In this work, we aim to harness the reasoning and generalization abilities of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for more effective spatio-temporal forecasting, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. However, recent studies uncover that PLMs, which are primarily trained on textual data, often falter when tasked with modeling the intricate correlations in numerical time series, thereby limiting their effectiveness in comprehending spatio-temporal data. To bridge the gap, we propose RePST, a physics-aware PLM reprogramming framework tailored for spatio-temporal forecasting. Specifically, we first propose a physics-aware decomposer that adaptively disentangles spatially correlated time series into interpretable sub-components, which facilitates PLM to understand sophisticated spatio-temporal dynamics via a divide-and-conquer strategy. Moreover, we propose a selective discrete reprogramming scheme, which introduces an expanded spatio-temporal vocabulary space to project spatio-temporal series into discrete representations. This scheme minimizes the information loss during reprogramming and enriches the representations derived by PLMs. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed RePST outperforms twelve state-of-the-art baseline methods, particularly in data-scarce scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness and superior generalization capabilities of PLMs for spatio-temporal forecasting.</p></details> |  |

However, multimedia technology for contact interaction is less mature than non-contact multimedia technologies and requires further development. Specialized haptic media technologies, requiring low latency and bitrates, are essential to enable haptic interaction, necessitating haptic information compression. Existing vibrotactile signal compression methods, based on the perceptual model, do not consider the characteristics of fused tactile perception at multiple spatially distributed interaction points. In fact, differences in tactile perceptual importance are not limited to conventional frequency and time domains, but also encompass differences in the spatial locations on the skin unique to tactile perception. For the most frequently used tactile information, vibrotactile texture perception, we have developed a model to predict its perceptual importance at multiple points, based on self-supervised learning and Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network. Current experimental results indicate that this model can effectively predict the perceptual importance of various points in multi-point tactile perception scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at Eurohaptics 2024</p></details> |

This allows research into problems like anomaly detection, anti-money laundering, pattern mining and activity clustering (where data from traditional currencies is rarely available). The formalism of temporal networks offers a natural way of representing this data and offers access to a wealth of metrics and models. However, the large scale of the data presents a challenge using standard graph analysis techniques. We use temporal motifs to analyse two Bitcoin datasets and one NFT dataset, using sequences of three transactions and up to three users. We show that the commonly used technique of simply counting temporal motifs over all users and all time can give misleading conclusions. Here we also study the motifs contributed by each user and discover that the motif distribution is heavy-tailed and that the key players have diverse motif signatures. We study the motifs that occur in different time periods and find events and anomalous activity that cannot be seen just by a count on the whole dataset. Studying motif completion time reveals dynamics driven by human behaviour as well as algorithmic behaviour.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounded-VideoLLM: Sharpening Fine-grained Temporal Grounding in Video Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03290v1)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in coarse-grained video understanding, however, they struggle with fine-grained temporal grounding. In this paper, we introduce Grounded-VideoLLM, a novel Video-LLM adept at perceiving and reasoning over specific video moments in a fine-grained manner. We identify that current Video-LLMs have limitations for fine-grained video understanding since they lack effective temporal modeling and timestamp representation. In light of this, we sharpen our model by incorporating (1) an additional temporal stream to encode the relationships between frames and (2) discrete temporal tokens enriched with specific time knowledge to represent timestamps. To optimize the training of Grounded-VideoLLM, we employ a multi-stage training scheme, beginning with simple video-captioning tasks and progressively introducing video temporal grounding tasks of increasing complexity. To further enhance Grounded-VideoLLM's temporal reasoning capability, we also curate a grounded VideoQA dataset by an automatic annotation pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Grounded-VideoLLM not only excels in fine-grained grounding tasks such as temporal sentence grounding, dense video captioning, and grounded VideoQA, but also shows great potential as a versatile video assistant for general video understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Redefining Temporal Modeling in Video Diffusion: The Vectorized Timestep Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03160v1)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have revolutionized image generation, and their extension to video generation has shown promise. However, current video diffusion models~(VDMs) rely on a scalar timestep variable applied at the clip level, which limits their ability to model complex temporal dependencies needed for various tasks like image-to-video generation. To address this limitation, we propose a frame-aware video diffusion model~(FVDM), which introduces a novel vectorized timestep variable~(VTV). Unlike conventional VDMs, our approach allows each frame to follow an independent noise schedule, enhancing the model's capacity to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies. FVDM's flexibility is demonstrated across multiple tasks, including standard video generation, image-to-video generation, video interpolation, and long video synthesis. Through a diverse set of VTV configurations, we achieve superior quality in generated videos, overcoming challenges such as catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning and limited generalizability in zero-shot methods.Our empirical evaluations show that FVDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in video generation quality, while also excelling in extended tasks. By addressing fundamental shortcomings in existing VDMs, FVDM sets a new paradigm in video synthesis, offering a robust framework with significant implications for generative modeling and multimedia applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code at https://github.com/Yaofang-Liu/FVDM</p></details> |

In particular, two problems emerge: (1) Encoding longer histories requires more computational resources, making it crucial for CTDG models to maintain low computational complexity to ensure efficiency; (2) Meanwhile, more powerful models are needed to identify and select the most critical temporal information within the extended context provided by longer histories. To address these problems, we propose a CTDG representation learning model named DyGMamba, originating from the popular Mamba state space model (SSM). DyGMamba first leverages a node-level SSM to encode the sequence of historical node interactions. Another time-level SSM is then employed to exploit the temporal patterns hidden in the historical graph, where its output is used to dynamically select the critical information from the interaction history. We validate DyGMamba experimentally on the dynamic link prediction task. The results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art in most cases. DyGMamba also maintains high efficiency in terms of computational resources, making it possible to capture long temporal dependencies with a limited computation budget.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Temporal Fact Reasoning over Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10219v3)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stemming from traditional knowledge graphs (KGs), hyper-relational KGs (HKGs) provide additional key-value pairs (i.e., qualifiers) for each KG fact that help to better restrict the fact validity. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in studying graph reasoning over HKGs. Meanwhile, as discussed in recent works that focus on temporal KGs (TKGs), world knowledge is ever-evolving, making it important to reason over temporal facts in KGs. Previous mainstream benchmark HKGs do not explicitly specify temporal information for each HKG fact. Therefore, almost all existing HKG reasoning approaches do not devise any module specifically for temporal reasoning. To better study temporal fact reasoning over HKGs, we propose a new type of data structure named hyper-relational TKG (HTKG). Every fact in an HTKG is coupled with a timestamp explicitly indicating its time validity. We develop two new benchmark HTKG datasets, i.e., Wiki-hy and YAGO-hy, and propose an HTKG reasoning model that efficiently models hyper-relational temporal facts. To support future research on this topic, we open-source our datasets and model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

As a result, both academia and industry are gradually shifting their attention towards the more complex challenges posed by understanding long-form videos. However, is this really the case? Our studies indicate that LMMs still lack many fundamental reasoning capabilities even when dealing with short videos. We introduce Vinoground, a temporal counterfactual LMM evaluation benchmark encompassing 1000 short and natural video-caption pairs. We demonstrate that existing LMMs severely struggle to distinguish temporal differences between different actions and object transformations. For example, the best model GPT-4o only obtains ~50% on our text and video scores, showing a large gap compared to the human baseline of ~90%. All open-source multimodal models and CLIP-based models perform much worse, producing mostly random chance performance. Through this work, we shed light onto the fact that temporal reasoning in short videos is a problem yet to be fully solved.

| **[Spatial-Temporal Multi-Cuts for Online Multiple-Camera Vehicle Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02638v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate online multiple-camera vehicle tracking is essential for intelligent transportation systems, autonomous driving, and smart city applications. Like single-camera multiple-object tracking, it is commonly formulated as a graph problem of tracking-by-detection. Within this framework, existing online methods usually consist of two-stage procedures that cluster temporally first, then spatially, or vice versa. This is computationally expensive and prone to error accumulation. We introduce a graph representation that allows spatial-temporal clustering in a single, combined step: New detections are spatially and temporally connected with existing clusters. By keeping sparse appearance and positional cues of all detections in a cluster, our method can compare clusters based on the strongest available evidence. The final tracks are obtained online using a simple multicut assignment procedure. Our method does not require any training on the target scene, pre-extraction of single-camera tracks, or additional annotations. Notably, we outperform the online state-of-the-art on the CityFlow dataset in terms of IDF1 by more than 14%, and on the Synthehicle dataset by more than 25%, respectively. The code is publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast spatio-temporally varying coefficient modeling with reluctant interaction selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07229v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatially and temporally varying coefficient (STVC) models are currently attracting attention as a flexible tool to explore the spatio-temporal patterns in regression coefficients. However, these models often struggle with balancing computational efficiency and model flexibility. To address this challenge, this study develops a fast and flexible method for STVC modeling. For enhanced flexibility in modeling, we assume multiple processes in each varying coefficient, including purely spatial, purely temporal, and spatio-temporal interaction processes with or without time cyclicity. While considering multiple processes can be time consuming, we combine a pre-conditioning method with a model selection procedure, inspired by reluctant interaction modeling. This approach allows us to computationally efficiently select and specify the latent space-time structure. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms alternatives in terms of coefficient estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. Finally, we apply the proposed method to crime analysis using a sample size of 279,360, confirming that the proposed method provides reasonable estimates of varying coefficients. The STVC model is implemented in an R package spmoran.</p></details> |  |

Effective monitoring of transformer health is critical to maintain grid stability and performance. Thermal insulation ageing is a key transformer failure mode, which is generally tracked by monitoring the hotspot temperature (HST). However, HST measurement is complex, costly, and often estimated from indirect measurements. Existing HST models focus on space-agnostic thermal models, providing worst-case HST estimates. This article introduces a spatio-temporal model for transformer winding temperature and ageing estimation, which leverages physics-based partial differential equations (PDEs) with data-driven Neural Networks (NN) in a Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) configuration to improve prediction accuracy and acquire spatio-temporal resolution. The computational accuracy of the PINN model is improved through the implementation of the Residual-Based Attention (PINN-RBA) scheme that accelerates the PINN model convergence. The PINN-RBA model is benchmarked against self-adaptive attention schemes and classical vanilla PINN configurations. For the first time, PINN based oil temperature predictions are used to estimate spatio-temporal transformer winding temperature values, validated through PDE numerical solution and fiber optic sensor measurements. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal transformer ageing model is inferred, which supports transformer health management decision-making. Results are validated with a distribution transformer operating on a floating photovoltaic power plant.</p></details> | 23 pages, 18 figures |

This allows for modeling non-linearities and interactions among predictor variables in a flexible data-driven manner and for accounting for spatio-temporal variation that is not explained by observable predictor variables. We also show how estimation and prediction can be done in a computationally efficient manner. In an application to a large U.S. mortgage credit risk data set, we find that both predictive default probabilities for individual loans and predictive loan portfolio loss distributions obtained with our novel approach are more accurate compared to conventional independent linear hazard models and also linear spatio-temporal models. Using interpretability tools for machine learning models, we find that the likely reasons for this outperformance are strong interaction and non-linear effects in the predictor variables and the presence of large spatio-temporal frailty effects.</p></details> |  |

Our goal is to reduce the amount of information transmitted from the distributed agents to the parameter server by exploiting temporal correlation in the local gradients. We use a linear predictor that \textit{combines past gradients to form a prediction of the current gradient}, with coefficients that are optimized by solving a least-square problem. In each iteration, every agent transmits the predictor coefficients to the server such that the predicted local gradient can be computed. The difference between the true local gradient and the predicted one, termed the \textit{prediction residual, is only transmitted when its norm is above some threshold.} When this additional communication step is omitted, the server uses the prediction as the estimated gradient. This proposed design shows notable performance gains compared to existing methods in the literature, achieving convergence with reduced communication costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, presented at the 60th Allerton conference on Communication, Control, and Computing</p></details> |

This paper addresses the challenge of long-horizon trajectory planning under temporally extended objectives in a receding horizon manner. To this end, we propose DOPPLER, a data-driven hierarchical framework that generates and updates plans based on instruction specified by linear temporal logic (LTL). Our method decomposes temporal tasks into chain of options with hierarchical reinforcement learning from offline non-expert datasets. It leverages diffusion models to generate options with low-level actions. We devise a determinantal-guided posterior sampling technique during batch generation, which improves the speed and diversity of diffusion generated options, leading to more efficient querying. Experiments on robot navigation and manipulation tasks demonstrate that DOPPLER can generate sequences of trajectories that progressively satisfy the specified formulae for obstacle avoidance and sequential visitation.

In this work, we introduce Temporal Grounding Bridge (TGB), a novel framework that bootstraps MLLMs with advanced temporal grounding capabilities and broadens their contextual scope. Our framework significantly enhances the temporal capabilities of current MLLMs through three key innovations: an efficient multi-span temporal grounding algorithm applied to low-dimension temporal features projected from flow; a multimodal length extrapolation training paradigm that utilizes low-dimension temporal features to extend the training context window size; and a bootstrapping framework that bridges our model with pluggable MLLMs without requiring annotation. We validate TGB across seven video benchmarks and demonstrate substantial performance improvements compared with prior MLLMs. Notably, our model, initially trained on sequences of four frames, effectively handles sequences up to 16 longer without sacrificing performance, highlighting its scalability and effectiveness in real-world applications.

We propose Contrastive Long-form Language-Audio Pretraining (\textbf{CoLLAP}) to significantly extend the perception window for both the input audio (up to 5 minutes) and the language descriptions (exceeding 250 words), while enabling contrastive learning across modalities and temporal dynamics. Leveraging recent Music-LLMs to generate long-form music captions for full-length songs, augmented with musical temporal structures, we collect 51.3K audio-text pairs derived from the large-scale AudioSet training dataset, where the average audio length reaches 288 seconds. We propose a novel contrastive learning architecture that fuses language representations with structured audio representations by segmenting each song into clips and extracting their embeddings. With an attention mechanism, we capture multimodal temporal correlations, allowing the model to automatically weigh and enhance the final fusion score for improved contrastive alignment. Finally, we develop two variants of the CoLLAP model with different types of backbone language models. Through comprehensive experiments on multiple long-form music-text retrieval datasets, we demonstrate consistent performance improvement in retrieval accuracy compared with baselines. We also show the pretrained CoLLAP models can be transferred to various music information retrieval tasks, with heterogeneous long-form multimodal contexts.</p></details> | 4 pages |

This framework incorporates two key innovations: (1) a redundant video feature removal module that filters out unnecessary visual information, and (2) a temporal-aware masking strategy that leverages temporal context for enhanced audio generation accuracy. In contrast to existing resource-heavy Unet-based models, MDSGen employs denoising masked diffusion transformers, facilitating efficient generation without reliance on pre-trained diffusion models. Evaluated on the benchmark VGGSound dataset, our smallest model (5M parameters) achieves 97.9% alignment accuracy, using 172x fewer parameters, 371% less memory, and offering 36x faster inference than the current 860M-parameter state-of-the-art model (93.9% accuracy).

| **[HyperBrain: Anomaly Detection for Temporal Hypergraph Brain Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02087v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying unusual brain activity is a crucial task in neuroscience research, as it aids in the early detection of brain disorders. It is common to represent brain networks as graphs, and researchers have developed various graph-based machine learning methods for analyzing them. However, the majority of existing graph learning tools for the brain face a combination of the following three key limitations. First, they focus only on pairwise correlations between regions of the brain, limiting their ability to capture synchronized activity among larger groups of regions. Second, they model the brain network as a static network, overlooking the temporal changes in the brain. Third, most are designed only for classifying brain networks as healthy or disordered, lacking the ability to identify abnormal brain activity patterns linked to biomarkers associated with disorders. To address these issues, we present HyperBrain, an unsupervised anomaly detection framework for temporal hypergraph brain networks. HyperBrain models fMRI time series data as temporal hypergraphs capturing dynamic higher-order interactions. It then uses a novel customized temporal walk (BrainWalk) and neural encodings to detect abnormal co-activations among brain regions. We evaluate the performance of HyperBrain in both synthetic and real-world settings for Autism Spectrum Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder(ADHD). HyperBrain outperforms all other baselines on detecting abnormal co-activations in brain networks. Furthermore, results obtained from HyperBrain are consistent with clinical research on these brain disorders. Our findings suggest that learning temporal and higher-order connections in the brain provides a promising approach to uncover intricate connectivity patterns in brain networks, offering improved diagnosis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Temporal Decorrelation of State Estimates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02065v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many commercial and defense applications involve multisensor, multitarget tracking, requiring the fusion of information from a set of sensors. An interesting use case occurs when data available at a central node (due to geometric diversity or retrodiction) allows for the tailoring of state estimation for a target. For instance, if a target is initially tracked with a maneuvering target filter, yet the target is clearly not maneuvering in retrospect, it would be beneficial at the fusion node to refilter that data with a non-maneuvering target filter. If measurements can be shared to the central node, the refiltering process can be accomplished by simply passing source measurements through an updated state estimation process. It is often the case for large, distributed systems, however, that only track information can be passed to a fusion center. In this circumstance, refiltering data becomes less straightforward as track states are linearly dependent across time, and the correlation needs to be properly accounted for before/during refiltering. In this work, a model-based temporal decorrelation process for state estimates with process noise will be studied. A decorrelation procedure will be presented based on a linear algebraic formulation of the problem, and process noise estimates will be created that ensure a conservative system state estimate. Numerical examples will be given to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[TPP-LLM: Modeling Temporal Point Processes by Efficiently Fine-Tuning Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02062v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal point processes (TPPs) are widely used to model the timing and occurrence of events in domains such as social networks, transportation systems, and e-commerce. In this paper, we introduce TPP-LLM, a novel framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with TPPs to capture both the semantic and temporal aspects of event sequences. Unlike traditional methods that rely on categorical event type representations, TPP-LLM directly utilizes the textual descriptions of event types, enabling the model to capture rich semantic information embedded in the text. While LLMs excel at understanding event semantics, they are less adept at capturing temporal patterns. To address this, TPP-LLM incorporates temporal embeddings and employs parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods to effectively learn temporal dynamics without extensive retraining. This approach improves both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. Experimental results across diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that TPP-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in sequence modeling and event prediction, highlighting the benefits of combining LLMs with TPPs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Engagement Measurement Based on Facial Landmarks and Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17175v2)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Engagement in virtual learning is crucial for a variety of factors including student satisfaction, performance, and compliance with learning programs, but measuring it is a challenging task. There is therefore considerable interest in utilizing artificial intelligence and affective computing to measure engagement in natural settings as well as on a large scale. This paper introduces a novel, privacy-preserving method for engagement measurement from videos. It uses facial landmarks, which carry no personally identifiable information, extracted from videos via the MediaPipe deep learning solution. The extracted facial landmarks are fed to Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (ST-GCNs) to output the engagement level of the student in the video. To integrate the ordinal nature of the engagement variable into the training process, ST-GCNs undergo training in a novel ordinal learning framework based on transfer learning. Experimental results on two video student engagement measurement datasets show the superiority of the proposed method compared to previous methods with improved state-of-the-art on the EngageNet dataset with a 3.1% improvement in four-class engagement level classification accuracy and on the Online Student Engagement dataset with a 1.5% improvement in binary engagement classification accuracy. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was applied to the developed ST-GCNs to interpret the engagement measurements obtained by the proposed method in both the spatial and temporal domains. The relatively lightweight and fast ST-GCN and its integration with the real-time MediaPipe make the proposed approach capable of being deployed on virtual learning platforms and measuring engagement in real-time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Test-Time Adaptation with State-Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12492v2)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distribution shifts between training and test data are inevitable over the lifecycle of a deployed model, leading to performance decay. Adapting a model on test samples can help mitigate this drop in performance. However, most test-time adaptation methods have focused on synthetic corruption shifts, leaving a variety of distribution shifts underexplored. In this paper, we focus on distribution shifts that evolve gradually over time, which are common in the wild but challenging for existing methods, as we show. To address this, we propose STAD, a probabilistic state-space model that adapts a deployed model to temporal distribution shifts by learning the time-varying dynamics in the last set of hidden features. Without requiring labels, our model infers time-evolving class prototypes that act as a dynamic classification head. Through experiments on real-world temporal distribution shifts, we show that our method excels in handling small batch sizes and label shift.</p></details> |  |

After at least 25 years since its discovery, we are finally able to provide a long-awaited almost sure convergence analysis. Namely, we are the first to prove that, under very mild conditions, tabular average reward TD converges almost surely to a sample path dependent fixed point. Key to this success is a new general stochastic approximation result concerning nonexpansive mappings with Markovian and additive noise, built on recent advances in stochastic Krasnoselskii-Mann iterations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Graph Representation Learning via Edge Temporal States Modeling and Structure-reinforced Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10079v3)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic graph representation learning has emerged as a crucial research area, driven by the growing need for analyzing time-evolving graph data in real-world applications. While recent approaches leveraging recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise, they often fail to adequately capture the impact of temporal edge states on inter-node relationships, consequently overlooking the dynamic changes in node features induced by these evolving relationships. Furthermore, these methods suffer from GNNs' inherent over-smoothing problem, which hinders the extraction of global structural features. To address these challenges, we introduce the Recurrent Structure-reinforced Graph Transformer (RSGT), a novel framework for dynamic graph representation learning. It first designs a heuristic method to explicitly model edge temporal states by employing different edge types and weights based on the differences between consecutive snapshots, thereby integrating varying edge temporal states into the graph's topological structure. We then propose a structure-reinforced graph transformer that captures temporal node representations encoding both graph topology and evolving dynamics through a recurrent learning paradigm, enabling the extraction of both local and global structural features. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate RSGT's superior performance in discrete dynamic graph representation learning, consistently outperforming existing methods in dynamic link prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the Elsevier for possible publication.

| **[Exploring Scalability of Self-Training for Open-Vocabulary Temporal Action Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07024v2)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vocabulary size in temporal action localization (TAL) is limited by the scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets. To overcome this, recent works integrate vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, for open-vocabulary TAL (OV-TAL). However, despite the success of VLMs trained on extensive datasets, existing OV-TAL methods still rely on human-labeled TAL datasets of limited size to train action localizers, limiting their generalizability. In this paper, we explore the scalability of self-training with unlabeled YouTube videos for OV-TAL. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) a class-agnostic action localizer is trained on a human-labeled TAL dataset to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled videos, and (2) the large-scale pseudo-labeled dataset is then used to train the localizer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that leveraging web-scale videos in self-training significantly enhances the generalizability of an action localizer. Additionally, we identify limitations in existing OV-TAL evaluation schemes and propose a new benchmark for thorough assessment. Finally, we showcase the TAL performance of the large multimodal model Gemini-1.5 on our new benchmark. Code is released at https://github.com/HYUNJS/STOV-TAL.</p></details> |  |

However, as LLMs' in-context learning abilities continue to improve, understanding this phenomenon mechanistically becomes increasingly important. In particular, it is not well-understood how LLMs learn to solve specific classes of problems, such as reinforcement learning (RL) problems, in-context. Through three different tasks, we first show that Llama $3$ $70$B can solve simple RL problems in-context. We then analyze the residual stream of Llama using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and find representations that closely match temporal difference (TD) errors. Notably, these representations emerge despite the model only being trained to predict the next token. We verify that these representations are indeed causally involved in the computation of TD errors and $Q$-values by performing carefully designed interventions on them. Taken together, our work establishes a methodology for studying and manipulating in-context learning with SAEs, paving the way for a more mechanistic understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Gaussian Temporal Difference Error for Uncertainty-aware Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02295v2)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional uncertainty-aware temporal difference (TD) learning methods often rely on simplistic assumptions, typically including a zero-mean Gaussian distribution for TD errors. Such oversimplification can lead to inaccurate error representations and compromised uncertainty estimation. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for generalized Gaussian error modeling in deep reinforcement learning, applicable to both discrete and continuous control settings. Our framework enhances the flexibility of error distribution modeling by incorporating additional higher-order moment, particularly kurtosis, thereby improving the estimation and mitigation of data-dependent noise, i.e., aleatoric uncertainty. We examine the influence of the shape parameter of the generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) on aleatoric uncertainty and provide a closed-form expression that demonstrates an inverse relationship between uncertainty and the shape parameter. Additionally, we propose a theoretically grounded weighting scheme to fully leverage the GGD. To address epistemic uncertainty, we enhance the batch inverse variance weighting by incorporating bias reduction and kurtosis considerations, resulting in improved robustness. Extensive experimental evaluations using policy gradient algorithms demonstrate the consistent efficacy of our method, showcasing significant performance improvements.</p></details> |  |

TAVRNN captures temporal changes in network structure by modeling sequential snapshots of neuronal activity, enabling the identification of key connectivity patterns. Leveraging temporal attention mechanisms and variational graph techniques, TAVRNN uncovers how connectivity shifts align with behavior over time. We validate TAVRNN on two datasets: in vivo calcium imaging data from freely behaving rats and novel in vitro electrophysiological data from the DishBrain system, where biological neurons control a simulated environment during the game of pong. We show that TAVRNN outperforms previous baseline models in classification, clustering tasks and computational efficiency while accurately linking connectivity changes to performance variations. Crucially, TAVRNN reveals that high game performance in the DishBrain system correlates with the alignment of sensory and motor subregion channels, a relationship not evident in earlier models. This framework represents the first application of dynamic graph representation of electrophysiological (neuronal) data from DishBrain system, providing insights into the reorganization of neuronal networks during learning. TAVRNN's ability to differentiate between neuronal states associated with successful and unsuccessful learning outcomes, offers significant implications for real-time monitoring and manipulation of biological neuronal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 6 figures, 4 supplemental figures, 4 tables, 8 supplemental tables</p></details> |
| **[Arges: Spatio-Temporal Transformer for Ulcerative Colitis Severity Assessment in Endoscopy Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00536v1)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate assessment of disease severity from endoscopy videos in ulcerative colitis (UC) is crucial for evaluating drug efficacy in clinical trials. Severity is often measured by the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) and Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS) score. However, expert MES/UCEIS annotation is time-consuming and susceptible to inter-rater variability, factors addressable by automation. Automation attempts with frame-level labels face challenges in fully-supervised solutions due to the prevalence of video-level labels in clinical trials. CNN-based weakly-supervised models (WSL) with end-to-end (e2e) training lack generalization to new disease scores and ignore spatio-temporal information crucial for accurate scoring. To address these limitations, we propose "Arges", a deep learning framework that utilizes a transformer with positional encoding to incorporate spatio-temporal information from frame features to estimate disease severity scores in endoscopy video. Extracted features are derived from a foundation model (ArgesFM), pre-trained on a large diverse dataset from multiple clinical trials (61M frames, 3927 videos). We evaluate four UC disease severity scores, including MES and three UCEIS component scores. Test set evaluation indicates significant improvements, with F1 scores increasing by 4.1% for MES and 18.8%, 6.6%, 3.8% for the three UCEIS component scores compared to state-of-the-art methods. Prospective validation on previously unseen clinical trial data further demonstrates the model's successful generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables, accepted at MLMI, MICCAI</p></details> |

However, many trajectory prediction models produce unreasonable trajectory samples that focus on improving diversity or accuracy while neglecting other key requirements, such as collision avoidance with the surrounding environment. In this work, we propose TrajDiffuse, a planning-based trajectory prediction method using a novel guided conditional diffusion model. We form the trajectory prediction problem as a denoising impaint task and design a map-based guidance term for the diffusion process. TrajDiffuse is able to generate trajectory predictions that match or exceed the accuracy and diversity of the SOTA, while adhering almost perfectly to environmental constraints. We demonstrate the utility of our model through experiments on the nuScenes and PFSD datasets and provide an extensive benchmark analysis against the SOTA methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published as inpreceedings of the 2024 International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a novel computationally efficient approach for trajectory optimization on matrix Lie groups using an augmented Lagrangian-based constrained discrete Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP). The method involves lifting the optimization problem to the Lie algebra during the backward pass and retracting back to the manifold during the forward pass. Unlike previous approaches that addressed constraint handling only for specific classes of matrix Lie groups, the proposed method provides a general solution for nonlinear constraint handling across generic matrix Lie groups. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed DDP method in handling constraints within a mechanical system characterized by rigid body dynamics in SE(3), assessing its computational efficiency compared to existing direct optimization solvers. Additionally, the method demonstrates robustness under external disturbances when applied as a Lie-algebraic feedback control policy on SE(3), and in optimizing a quadrotor's trajectory in a challenging realistic scenario. Experiments show that the proposed approach effectively manages general constraints defined on configuration, velocity, and inputs during optimization, while also maintaining stability under external disturbances when executing the resultant control policy in closed-loop.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[DragEntity: Trajectory Guided Video Generation using Entity and Positional Relationships](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10751v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, diffusion models have achieved tremendous success in the field of video generation, with controllable video generation receiving significant attention. However, existing control methods still face two limitations: Firstly, control conditions (such as depth maps, 3D Mesh) are difficult for ordinary users to obtain directly. Secondly, it's challenging to drive multiple objects through complex motions with multiple trajectories simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce DragEntity, a video generation model that utilizes entity representation for controlling the motion of multiple objects. Compared to previous methods, DragEntity offers two main advantages: 1) Our method is more user-friendly for interaction because it allows users to drag entities within the image rather than individual pixels. 2) We use entity representation to represent any object in the image, and multiple objects can maintain relative spatial relationships. Therefore, we allow multiple trajectories to control multiple objects in the image with different levels of complexity simultaneously. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of DragEntity, demonstrating its excellent performance in fine-grained control in video generation.</p></details> | ACM MM2024 Oral |

Prior works typically neglect to maintain uncertainty about occluded objects and only predict trajectories of observed objects using high-capacity models such as Transformers trained on large datasets. While these approaches are effective in standard scenarios, they can struggle to generalize to the long-tail, safety-critical scenarios. In this work, we explore a conceptual framework unifying trajectory prediction and occlusion reasoning under the same class of structured probabilistic generative model, namely, switching dynamical systems. We then present some initial experiments illustrating its capabilities using the Waymo open dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ergodic Trajectory Optimization on Generalized Domains Using Maximum Mean Discrepancy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10599v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel formulation of ergodic trajectory optimization that can be specified over general domains using kernel maximum mean discrepancy. Ergodic trajectory optimization is an effective approach that generates coverage paths for problems related to robotic inspection, information gathering problems, and search and rescue. These optimization schemes compel the robot to spend time in a region proportional to the expected utility of visiting that region. Current methods for ergodic trajectory optimization rely on domain-specific knowledge, e.g., a defined utility map, and well-defined spatial basis functions to produce ergodic trajectories. Here, we present a generalization of ergodic trajectory optimization based on maximum mean discrepancy that requires only samples from the search domain. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to produce coverage trajectories on a variety of problem domains including robotic inspection of objects with differential kinematics constraints and on Lie groups without having access to domain specific knowledge. Furthermore, we show favorable computational scaling compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for ergodic trajectory optimization with a trade-off between domain specific knowledge and computational scaling, thus extending the versatility of ergodic coverage on a wider application domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages (excluding references), 1 table, 8 figures, submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[On the Distribution of Probe Traffic Volume Estimated without Trajectory Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15274v2)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, passively recorded probe traffic volumes have increasingly been used to estimate traffic volumes. However, it is not always possible to count probe traffic volume in a spatial dataset when probe trajectories cannot be fully reconstructed from raw probe point location data due to sparse recording intervals, lack of pseudonyms or timestamps. As a result, the application of such probe point location data has been limited in traffic volume estimation. To relax these constraints, we present the exact distribution of the estimated probe traffic volume in a road segment based on probe point location data without trajectory reconstruction. The distribution of the estimated probe traffic volume can exhibit multimodality, without necessarily being line-symmetric with respect to the true probe traffic volume. As more probes are present, the distribution approaches a normal distribution. The conformity of the distribution was visualised through numerical simulations. Sometimes, there exists a local optimal cordon length that maximises estimation precision. The theoretical variance of estimated probe traffic volume can address heteroscedasticity in the modelling of traffic volume estimates.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Generative inpainting of incomplete Euclidean distance matrices of trajectories generated by a fractional Brownian motion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07029v2)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fractional Brownian motion (fBm) features both randomness and strong scale-free correlations, challenging generative models to reproduce the intrinsic memory characterizing the underlying stochastic process. Here we examine a zoo of diffusion-based inpainting methods on a specific dataset of corrupted images, which represent incomplete Euclidean distance matrices (EDMs) of fBm at various memory exponents $H$. Our dataset implies uniqueness of the data imputation in the regime of low missing ratio, where the remaining partial graph is rigid, providing the ground truth for the inpainting. We find that the conditional diffusion generation readily reproduces the built-in correlations of fBm paths in different memory regimes (i.e., for sub-, Brownian and super-diffusion trajectories), providing a robust tool for the statistical imputation at high missing ratio. Furthermore, while diffusion models have been recently shown to memorize samples from the training database, we demonstrate that diffusion behaves qualitatively different from the database search and thus generalize rather than memorize the training dataset. As a biological application, we apply our fBm-trained diffusion model for the imputation of microscopy-derived distance matrices of chromosomal segments (FISH data) - incomplete due to experimental imperfections - and demonstrate its superiority over the standard approaches used in bioinformatics.</p></details> |  |

In particular, the proposed motion factorization strategy can facilitate to implicitly characterize the high-dimensional visual signal into compact motion vectors for representation compactness and further transform these vectors into a fine-grained field for motion expressibility. As such, the coded bit-stream can be entailed with enough visual motion information at the lowest representation cost. Meanwhile, a resolution-expandable generative module is developed with enhanced background stability, such that the proposed framework can be optimized towards higher reconstruction robustness and more flexible resolution adaptation. Experimental results show that proposed method outperforms latest generative models and the state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video Coding (VVC) on both talking-face videos and moving-body videos in terms of both objective and subjective quality.

Conventional stochastic trajectory prediction methods utilize latent variables to represent the multi-modality of vessel motion, however, tends to overlook the complexity and dynamics inherent in maritime behavior. In contrast, we explicitly simulate the transition of vessel motion from uncertainty towards a state of certainty, effectively handling future indeterminacy in dynamic scenes. In this paper, we present a novel framework (\textit{DiffuTraj}) to conceptualize the trajectory prediction task as a guided reverse process of motion pattern uncertainty diffusion, in which we progressively remove uncertainty from maritime regions to delineate the intended trajectory. Specifically, we encode the previous states of the target vessel, vessel-vessel interactions, and the environment context as guiding factors for trajectory generation. Subsequently, we devise a transformer-based conditional denoiser to capture spatio-temporal dependencies, enabling the generation of trajectories better aligned for particular maritime environment. Comprehensive experiments on vessel trajectory prediction benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>conta...</summary><p>containing 14pages, 9 figures and 3 tables; Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems on 17-June-2024</p></details> |

This paper explores the indirect method of trajectory optimization, emphasizing its application in creating optimal periodic gaits for legged systems and contrasting it with the more commonly used direct method. While the direct method provides considerable flexibility in its implementation, it is limited by its input space parameterization. In contrast, the indirect method improves accuracy by defining control inputs as functions of the system's states and costates. We tackle the convergence challenges associated with indirect shooting methods, particularly through the systematic development of gait libraries by utilizing numerical continuation methods. Our contributions include: (1) the formalization of a general periodic trajectory optimization problem that extends existing first-order necessary conditions for a broader range of cost functions and operating conditions; (2) a methodology for efficiently generating libraries of optimal trajectories (gaits) utilizing a single shooting approach combined with numerical continuation methods, including a novel approach for reconstructing Lagrange multipliers and costates from passive gaits; and (3) a comparative analysis of the indirect and direct shooting methods using a compass-gait walker as a case study, demonstrating the former's superior accuracy in generating optimal gaits. The findings underscore the potential of the indirect method for generating families of optimal gaits, thereby advancing the field of trajectory optimization in legged robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to the International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR)</p></details> |

Recent manifold learning-based methods have partially addressed the dimensionality and dataset size issues, but struggle with the complex text-conditional distribution. In this paper we propose a text-based trajectory generation model that attempts to address all three challenges while relying on only a handful of demonstration trajectory data. Our key idea is to leverage recent flow-based models capable of capturing complex conditional distributions, not directly in the high-dimensional trajectory space, but rather in the low-dimensional latent coordinate space of the motion manifold, with deliberately designed regularization terms to ensure smoothness of motions and robustness to text variations. We show that our Motion Manifold Flow Primitive (MMFP) framework can accurately generate qualitatively distinct motions for a wide range of text inputs, significantly outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 15 figures, under review</p></details> |

State-of-the-art human trajectory prediction methods are limited by their focus on collision avoidance and short-term planning, and their inability to model complex interactions of humans with the environment. In contrast, our approach overcomes these limitations by predicting sequences of human interactions with the environment and using this information to guide trajectory predictions over a horizon of up to 60s. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict interactions with the environment by conditioning the LLM prediction on rich contextual information about the scene. This information is given as a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph that encodes the geometry, semantics, and traversability of the environment into a hierarchical representation. We then ground these interaction sequences into multi-modal spatio-temporal distributions over human positions using a probabilistic approach based on continuous-time Markov Chains. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new semi-synthetic dataset of long-term human trajectories in complex indoor environments, which also includes annotations of human-object interactions. We show in thorough experimental evaluations that our approach achieves a 54% lower average negative log-likelihood and a 26.5% lower Best-of-20 displacement error compared to the best non-privileged (i.e., evaluated in a zero-shot fashion on the dataset) baselines for a time horizon of 60s.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

Instead of using passively observed trajectories like existing methods, we actively maximize the differences in the follower's trajectories under different hypotheses by optimizing the leader's control inputs. Compared with uniformly random inputs, the optimized inputs accelerate the convergence of the estimated probability of different hypotheses conditioned on the follower's trajectory.

Traditional outlier detection relies on heuristic rules, which requires domain knowledge and limits its ability to identify unseen outliers. Besides, there lacks a comprehensive approach that can jointly consider multi-modal data across spatial, temporal, and textual dimensions. Addressing the need for a domain-agnostic model, we propose the Transferable Outlier Detection for Human Semantic Trajectories (TOD4Traj) framework.TOD4Traj first introduces a modality feature unification module to align diverse data feature representations, enabling the integration of multi-modal information and enhancing transferability across different datasets. A contrastive learning module is further pro-posed for identifying regular mobility patterns both temporally and across populations, allowing for a joint detection of outliers based on individual consistency and group majority patterns. Our experimental results have shown TOD4Traj's superior performance over existing models, demonstrating its effectiveness and adaptability in detecting human trajectory outliers across various datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an accepted paper on https://sigspatial2024.sigspatial.org/accepted-papers/</p></details> |

Although many methods have been explored, they all assign correlation coefficients to surrounding agents in a purely learning-based manner. In this study, we present ASPILin, which manually selects interacting agents and calculates their correlations instead of attention scores. Surprisingly, these simple modifications can significantly improve prediction performance and substantially reduce computational costs. Additionally, ASPILin models the interacting agents at each past time step separately, rather than only modeling the interacting agents at the current time step. This clarifies the causal chain of the target agent's historical trajectory and helps the model better understand dynamic interactions. We intentionally simplified our model in other aspects, such as map encoding. Remarkably, experiments conducted on the INTERACTION, highD, and CitySim datasets demonstrate that our method is efficient and straightforward, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code:https://github.com/kkk00714/ASPILin</p></details> |
| **[Encoding Agent Trajectories as Representations with Sequence Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09204v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal data faces many analogous challenges to natural language text including the ordering of locations (words) in a sequence, long range dependencies between locations, and locations having multiple meanings. In this work, we propose a novel model for representing high dimensional spatiotemporal trajectories as sequences of discrete locations and encoding them with a Transformer-based neural network architecture. Similar to language models, our Sequence Transformer for Agent Representation Encodings (STARE) model can learn representations and structure in trajectory data through both supervisory tasks (e.g., classification), and self-supervisory tasks (e.g., masked modelling). We present experimental results on various synthetic and real trajectory datasets and show that our proposed model can learn meaningful encodings that are useful for many downstream tasks including discriminating between labels and indicating similarity between locations. Using these encodings, we also learn relationships between agents and locations present in spatiotemporal data.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, to be presented at GeoAI workshop at ACM SigSpatial 2024</p></details> |

Existing cross-domain policy transfer methods mostly aim at learning domain correspondences or corrections to facilitate policy learning, such as learning domain/task-specific discriminators, representations, or policies. This design philosophy often results in heavy model architectures or task/domain-specific modeling, lacking flexibility. This reality makes us wonder: can we directly bridge the domain gaps universally at the data level, instead of relying on complex downstream cross-domain policy transfer models? In this study, we propose the Cross-Domain Trajectory EDiting (xTED) framework that employs a specially designed diffusion model for cross-domain trajectory adaptation. Our proposed model architecture effectively captures the intricate dependencies among states, actions, and rewards, as well as the dynamics patterns within target data. By utilizing the pre-trained diffusion as a prior, source domain trajectories can be transformed to match with target domain properties while preserving original semantic information. This process implicitly corrects underlying domain gaps, enhancing state realism and dynamics reliability in the source data, and allowing flexible incorporation with various downstream policy learning methods. Despite its simplicity, xTED demonstrates superior performance in extensive simulation and real-robot experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>xTED ...</summary><p>xTED offers a novel, generic, flexible, simple and effective paradigm that casts cross-domain policy adaptation as a data pre-processing problem</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing NeRF-based SLAM with Trajectory Smoothness Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08780v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The joint optimization of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and camera trajectories has been widely applied in SLAM tasks due to its superior dense mapping quality and consistency. NeRF-based SLAM learns camera poses using constraints by implicit map representation. A widely observed phenomenon that results from the constraints of this form is jerky and physically unrealistic estimated camera motion, which in turn affects the map quality. To address this deficiency of current NeRF-based SLAM, we propose in this paper TS-SLAM (TS for Trajectory Smoothness). It introduces smoothness constraints on camera trajectories by representing them with uniform cubic B-splines with continuous acceleration that guarantees smooth camera motion. Benefiting from the differentiability and local control properties of B-splines, TS-SLAM can incrementally learn the control points end-to-end using a sliding window paradigm. Additionally, we regularize camera trajectories by exploiting the dynamics prior to further smooth trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that TS-SLAM achieves superior trajectory accuracy and improves mapping quality versus NeRF-based SLAM that does not employ the above smoothness constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear second-order dynamics describe labial constriction trajectories across languages and contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08351v1)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the dynamics of labial constriction trajectories during the production of /b/ and /m/ in English and Mandarin. We find that, across languages and contexts, the ratio of instantaneous displacement to instantaneous velocity generally follows an exponential decay curve from movement onset to movement offset. We formalize this empirical discovery in a differential equation and, in combination with an assumption of point attractor dynamics, derive a nonlinear second-order dynamical system describing labial constriction trajectories. The equation has only two parameters, T and r. T corresponds to the target state and r corresponds to movement rapidity. Thus, each of the parameters corresponds to a phonetically relevant dimension of control. Nonlinear regression demonstrates that the model provides excellent fits to individual movement trajectories. Moreover, trajectories simulated from the model qualitatively match empirical trajectories, and capture key kinematic variables like duration, peak velocity, and time to achieve peak velocity. The model constitutes a proposal for the dynamics of individual articulatory movements, and thus offers a novel foundation from which to understand additional influences on articulatory kinematics like prosody, inter-movement coordination, and stochastic noise.</p></details> |  |

This approach has gained traction due to its ability to bridge the gap between perception and planning that exists in traditional methods, thereby eliminating delays between modules. However, the practice of replacing original modules with neural networks in a black-box manner diminishes the overall system's robustness and stability. It lacks principled explanations and often fails to consistently generate high-quality motion trajectories. Furthermore, such methods often struggle to rigorously account for the robot's kinematic constraints, resulting in the generation of trajectories that cannot be executed satisfactorily. In this work, we combine the advantages of traditional methods and neural networks by proposing an optimization-embedded neural network. This network can learn high-quality trajectories directly from visual inputs without the need of mapping, while ensuring dynamic feasibility. Here, the deep neural network is employed to directly extract environment safety regions from depth images. Subsequently, we employ a model-based approach to represent these regions as safety constraints in trajectory optimization. Leveraging the availability of highly efficient optimization algorithms, our method robustly converges to feasible and optimal solutions that satisfy various user-defined constraints. Moreover, we differentiate the optimization process, allowing it to be trained as a layer within the neural network. This approach facilitates the direct interaction between perception and planning, enabling the network to focus more on the spatial regions where optimal solutions exist. As a result, it further enhances the quality and stability of the generated trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Some ...</summary><p>Some statements in the introduction may be controversial</p></details> |

Leveraging a novel annotation pipeline, we are able to scale the annotated trajectories and generate a trajectory dataset with minimized difficulty bias. Furthermore, we fine-tune LLMs on AgentBank to get a series of agent models, Samoyed.

| **[Reliable Probabilistic Human Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06905v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous systems, like vehicles or robots, require reliable, accurate, fast, resource-efficient, scalable, and low-latency trajectory predictions to get initial knowledge about future locations and movements of surrounding objects for safe human-machine interaction. Furthermore, they need to know the uncertainty of the predictions for risk assessment to provide safe path planning. This paper presents a lightweight method to address these requirements, combining Long Short-Term Memory and Mixture Density Networks. Our method predicts probability distributions, including confidence level estimations for positional uncertainty to support subsequent risk management applications and runs on a low-power embedded platform. We discuss essential requirements for human trajectory prediction in autonomous vehicle applications and demonstrate our method's performance using multiple traffic-related datasets. Furthermore, we explain reliability and sharpness metrics and show how important they are to guarantee the correctness and robustness of a model's predictions and uncertainty assessments. These essential evaluations have so far received little attention for no good reason. Our approach focuses entirely on real-world applicability. Verifying prediction uncertainties and a model's reliability are central to autonomous real-world applications.

| **[Generalized Consistency Trajectory Models for Image Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12510v3)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) excel in unconditional generation, as well as on applications such as image editing and restoration. The success of DMs lies in the iterative nature of diffusion: diffusion breaks down the complex process of mapping noise to data into a sequence of simple denoising tasks. Moreover, we are able to exert fine-grained control over the generation process by injecting guidance terms into each denoising step. However, the iterative process is also computationally intensive, often taking from tens up to thousands of function evaluations. Although consistency trajectory models (CTMs) enable traversal between any time points along the probability flow ODE (PFODE) and score inference with a single function evaluation, CTMs only allow translation from Gaussian noise to data. This work aims to unlock the full potential of CTMs by proposing generalized CTMs (GCTMs), which translate between arbitrary distributions via ODEs. We discuss the design space of GCTMs and demonstrate their efficacy in various image manipulation tasks such as image-to-image translation, restoration, and editing.</p></details> |  |

This work investigates LLMs' ability to estimate probability density functions (PDFs) from data observed in-context; such density estimation (DE) is a fundamental task underlying many probabilistic modeling problems. We leverage the Intensive Principal Component Analysis (InPCA) to visualize and analyze the in-context learning dynamics of LLaMA-2 models. Our main finding is that these LLMs all follow similar learning trajectories in a low-dimensional InPCA space, which are distinct from those of traditional density estimation methods like histograms and Gaussian kernel density estimation (KDE). We interpret the LLaMA in-context DE process as a KDE with an adaptive kernel width and shape. This custom kernel model captures a significant portion of LLaMA's behavior despite having only two parameters. We further speculate on why LLaMA's kernel width and shape differs from classical algorithms, providing insights into the mechanism of in-context probabilistic reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Control and state variable constraints are parameterized using Chebyshev polynomials and are accommodated in the optimal trajectory generation programs to incorporate the actuator limits and keepout constraints. Differentiable collision detection of polytopes is leveraged for optimal collision avoidance. Results obtained from the collocation methods are benchmarked against the existing approaches on an edge computer to outline the performance improvements. Finally, collaborative control scenarios involving multi-agent space systems are considered to demonstrate the technical merits of the proposed work.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE ACC 2025 for possible publication.

Local trajectory is obtained as a numerical solution of the Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem. Collision avoidance may be provided by adding repulsive potential of the obstacles to the cost function of MPC. We develop an approach, where repulsive potential is estimated by the neural model. We propose and explore three possible strategies of handling dynamic obstacles. First, environment with dynamic obstacles is considered as a sequence of static environments. Second, the neural model predict a sequence of repulsive potential at once. Third, the neural model predict future repulsive potential step by step in autoregressive mode. We implement these strategies and compare it with CIAO* and MPPI using BenchMR framework. First two strategies showed higher performance than CIAO* and MPPI while preserving safety constraints. The third strategy was a bit slower, however it still satisfy time limits. We deploy our approach on Husky UGV mobile platform, which move through the office corridors under proposed MPC local trajectory planner.

While prior works mostly rely on human feedback in the form of comparisons, language is a preferable modality that provides more informative insights into user preferences. In this work, we aim to incorporate comparative language feedback to iteratively improve robot trajectories and to learn reward functions that encode human preferences. To achieve this goal, we learn a shared latent space that integrates trajectory data and language feedback, and subsequently leverage the learned latent space to improve trajectories and learn human preferences. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to incorporate comparative language feedback into reward learning. Our simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned latent space and the success of our learning algorithms. We also conduct human subject studies that show our reward learning algorithm achieves a 23.9% higher subjective score on average and is 11.3% more time-efficient compared to preference-based reward learning, underscoring the superior performance of our method.

In this paper, we study the problem of computing joint torques and grasping forces for time-optimal motion of an object, while ensuring that the grasp is not lost and any constraints on the motion of the object, either due to dynamics, environment contact, or no-slip requirements, are also satisfied. We present a second-order cone program (SOCP) formulation of the time-optimal trajectory planning problem that considers nonlinear friction cone constraints at the hand-object and object-environment contacts. Since SOCPs are convex optimization problems that can be solved optimally in polynomial time using interior point methods, we can solve the trajectory optimization problem efficiently. We present simulation results on three examples, including a non-prehensile manipulation task, which shows the generality and effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Recent work has shown the potential for LLMs to infer preferences from user interactions, but they often produce broad and generic preferences, failing to capture the unique and individualized nature of human preferences. This paper introduces PREDICT, a method designed to enhance the precision and adaptability of inferring preferences. PREDICT incorporates three key elements: (1) iterative refinement of inferred preferences, (2) decomposition of preferences into constituent components, and (3) validation of preferences across multiple trajectories. We evaluate PREDICT on two distinct environments: a gridworld setting and a new text-domain environment (PLUME). PREDICT more accurately infers nuanced human preferences improving over existing baselines by 66.2\% (gridworld environment) and 41.0\% (PLUME).</p></details> |  |

However, existing trajectory anomaly detection methods are primarily focused on vehicle-level traffic, while human-level trajectory anomaly detection remains under-explored. Since human trajectory data is often very sparse, machine learning methods have become the preferred approach for identifying complex patterns. However, concerns regarding potential biases and the robustness of these models have intensified the demand for more transparent and explainable alternatives. In response to these challenges, our research focuses on developing a lightweight anomaly detection model specifically designed to detect anomalies in human trajectories. We propose a Neural Collaborative Filtering approach to model and predict normal mobility. Our method is designed to model users' daily patterns of life without requiring prior knowledge, thereby enhancing performance in scenarios where data is sparse or incomplete, such as in cold start situations. Our algorithm consists of two main modules. The first is the collaborative filtering module, which applies collaborative filtering to model normal mobility of individual humans to places of interest. The second is the neural module, responsible for interpreting the complex spatio-temporal relationships inherent in human trajectory data. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments using simulated and real-world datasets comparing to numerous state-of-the-art trajectory anomaly detection approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the 1st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Geospatial Anomaly Detection (GeoAnomalies'24)</p></details> |

This paper particularly focuses on generating sequences of images from the photorealistic Gaussian Splatting models, that match instructions that are given by user-inputted language. We contribute a novel framework, SplaTraj, which formulates the generation of images within photorealistic environment representations as a continuous-time trajectory optimization problem. Costs are designed so that a camera following the trajectory poses will smoothly traverse through the environment and render the specified spatial information in a photogenic manner. This is achieved by querying a photorealistic representation with language embedding to isolate regions that correspond to the user-specified inputs. These regions are then projected to the camera's view as it moves over time and a cost is constructed. We can then apply gradient-based optimization and differentiate through the rendering to optimize the trajectory for the defined cost. The resulting trajectory moves to photogenically view each of the specified objects. We empirically evaluate our approach on a suite of environments and instructions, and demonstrate the quality of generated image sequences.</p></details> |  |

To effectively promote cycling, early studies have extensively investigated the relationship between cycling behaviors and environmental factors, especially cyclists' preferences when making route decisions. However, these studies often struggle to comprehensively describe detailed cycling procedures at a large scale due to data limitations, and they tend to overlook the complex nature of cyclists' preferences. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework aimed to quantify and interpret cyclists' complicated visual preferences by leveraging maximum entropy deep inverse reinforcement learning(MEDIRL)and explainable artificial intelligence(XAI). Implemented in Bantian Sub-district, Shenzhen, we adapt MEDIRL model for efficient estimation of cycling reward function by integrating dockless-bike-sharing(DBS) trajectory and street view images(SVIs), which serves as a representation of cyclists' preferences for street visual environments during routing. In addition, we demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of MEDIRL in discovering cyclists' visual preferences. We find that cyclists focus on specific street visual elements when making route decisions, which can be summarized as their attention to safety, street enclosure, and cycling comfort. Further analysis reveals the complex nonlinear effects of street visual elements on cyclists' preferences, offering a cost-effective perspective on streetscapes design. Our proposed framework advances the understanding of individual cycling behaviors and provides actionable insights for urban planners to design bicycle-friendly streetscapes that prioritize cyclists' preferences.</p></details> | 39 pages, 16 figures |

Both algorithms are inspired by a novel theoretical paradigm known as probabilistic optimal control, that reformulates optimal control as an equivalent probabilistic inference problem. This perspective allows to address the problem using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. We show that the application of this algorithm results in a fixed point iteration of probabilistic policies that converge to the deterministic optimal policy. Two strategies for policy evaluation are discussed, using state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods resulting into two distinct algorithms. The algorithms are structurally closest related to the differential dynamic programming algorithm and related methods that use sigma-point methods to avoid direct gradient evaluations. The main advantage of our work is an improved balance between exploration and exploitation over the iterations, leading to improved numerical stability and accelerated convergence. These properties are demonstrated on different nonlinear systems.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent research, planning three-dimensional (3D) UAV trajectories over a continuous temporal-spatial domain remains challenging due to the need to solve computationally intensive optimization problems. In this paper, we study UAV-assisted IoT data collection aimed at minimizing total energy consumption while accounting for the UAV's physical capabilities, the heterogeneous data demands of IoT nodes, and 3D terrain. We propose a matrix-based differential evolution with constraint handling (MDE-CH), a computation-efficient evolutionary algorithm designed to address non-convex constrained optimization problems with several different types of constraints. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed MDE-CH algorithm provides a continuous 3D temporal-spatial UAV trajectory capable of efficiently minimizing energy consumption under various practical constraints and outperforms the conventional fly-hover-fly model for both two-dimensional (2D) and 3D trajectory planning.</p></details> |  |

This capability hinges on solving non-convex optimal control problems in real time, although traditional iterative methods such as sequential convex programming impose significant computational challenges. To mitigate this burden, the Autonomous Rendezvous Transformer introduced a generative model trained to provide near-optimal initial guesses. This approach provides convergence to better local optima (e.g., fuel optimality), improves feasibility rates, and results in faster convergence speed of optimization algorithms through warm-starting. This work extends the capabilities of ART to address robust chance-constrained optimal control problems. Specifically, ART is applied to challenging rendezvous scenarios in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), ensuring fault-tolerant behavior under uncertainty. Through extensive experimentation, the proposed warm-starting strategy is shown to consistently produce high-quality reference trajectories, achieving up to 30% cost improvement and 50% reduction in infeasible cases compared to conventional methods, demonstrating robust performance across multiple state representations. Additionally, a post hoc evaluation framework is proposed to assess the quality of generated trajectories and mitigate runtime failures, marking an initial step toward the reliable deployment of AI-driven solutions in safety-critical autonomous systems such as spacecraft.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the IEEE Aerospace Conference 2025. 13 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

This necessitates advanced interactive multi-agent motion planning techniques. Generalized Nash equilibrium(GNE), a solution concept in constrained game theory, provides a mathematical model to predict the outcome of interactive motion planning, where each agent needs to account for other agents in the environment. However, in practice, multiple local GNEs may exist. Finding a single GNE itself is complex as it requires solving coupled constrained optimal control problems. Furthermore, finding all such local GNEs requires exploring the solution space of GNEs, which is a challenging task. This work proposes the MultiNash-PF framework to efficiently compute multiple local GNEs in constrained trajectory games. Potential games are a class of games for which a local GNE of a trajectory game can be found by solving a single constrained optimal control problem. We propose MultiNash-PF that integrates the potential game approach with implicit particle filtering, a sample-efficient method for non-convex trajectory optimization. We first formulate the underlying game as a constrained potential game and then utilize the implicit particle filtering to identify the coarse estimates of multiple local minimizers of the game's potential function. MultiNash-PF then refines these estimates with optimization solvers, obtaining different local GNEs. We show through numerical simulations that MultiNash-PF reduces computation time by up to 50\% compared to a baseline approach.</p></details> |  |

Here, we extend by a significant step this proposal. Instead of using the explicit knowledge of the underlying equations of motion, we develop the method directly from system trajectories. This is crucial towards enhancing the practical implementation of the method in scenarios where solely data reflecting discrete snapshots of the system are available. We showcase the results of the method and the number of associated conservation laws obtained in a diverse range of examples including 1D and 2D harmonic oscillators, the Toda lattice, the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou lattice and the Calogero-Moser system.</p></details> |  |

To ensure safety, planners must rely on reliable uncertainty information about the predicted future behavior of surrounding agents, yet this aspect has received limited attention. This paper addresses the so-far neglected problem of uncertainty modeling in trajectory prediction. We adopt a holistic approach that focuses on uncertainty quantification, decomposition, and the influence of model composition. Our method is based on a theoretically grounded information-theoretic approach to measure uncertainty, allowing us to decompose total uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic components. We conduct extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset to assess how different model architectures and configurations affect uncertainty quantification and model robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, submitted to International Conference on Learning Representations (2025)</p></details> |

In this paper, we reformulate the trajectory optimization of this kind of method, focusing on enhancing both reconstruction quality and efficiency. Initially, we navigate effective restoration paths through a reinforcement learning process, gradually steering potential trajectories toward the most precise options. Additionally, to mitigate the considerable computational burden associated with iterative sampling, we propose cost-aware trajectory distillation to streamline complex paths into several manageable steps with adaptable sizes. Moreover, we fine-tune a foundational diffusion model (FLUX) with 12B parameters by using our algorithms, producing a unified framework for handling 7 kinds of image restoration tasks. Extensive experiments showcase the significant superiority of the proposed method, achieving a maximum PSNR improvement of 2.1 dB over state-of-the-art methods, while also greatly enhancing visual perceptual quality.

Specifically, the treble-functional UAVs are capable of offering communication and edge computing services to mobile users (MUs) in proximity, alongside their target sensing capabilities by using multi-input multi-output arrays. For the purpose of enhance the computation efficiency, we consider task compression, where each MU can partially compress their offloaded data prior to transmission to trim its size. The objective is to minimize the weighted energy consumption by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming, the UAVs' trajectories, the compression and offloading partition, the computation resource allocation, while fulfilling the causal-effect correlation between communication and computation as well as adhering to the constraints on sensing quality. To tackle it, we first reformulate the original problem as a multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP), which involves heterogeneous agents to decompose the large state spaces and action spaces of MDP. Then, we propose a multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm with attention mechanism to handle the decision-making problem. Simulation results validate the significant effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing energy consumption. Moreover, it demonstrates superior performance compared to the baselines in relation to resource utilization and convergence speed.</p></details> | 15 pages, 13 figures |

The proposed trajectory is constructed by the concatenation of three circular arcs of varying radii. Such a trajectory guarantees a complete coverage of the maximum set of reachable lengths while minimising the number of changeover points in the trajectory to a maximum of two under all scenarios. Additionally, by using the notion of internally tangent circles, we expand the set of Circle-Circle-Circle trajectories to eight kinds, consisting of {LLL, LLR, LRR, LRL, RRL, RLL, RLR, RRR} paths. The paper presents a mathematical formulation of the proposed trajectory and the conditions for the existence and classification of each kind of trajectory. We also analyse the variation of the length of the trajectory using suitable elongation strategies and derive the set of reachable lengths for all pairs of oriented points.

| **[TR-LLM: Integrating Trajectory Data for Scene-Aware LLM-Based Human Action Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03993v1)** | 2024-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of human behavior is crucial for AI systems to effectively support real-world applications, such as autonomous robots anticipating and assisting with human tasks. Real-world scenarios frequently present challenges such as occlusions and incomplete scene observations, which can compromise predictive accuracy. Thus, traditional video-based methods often struggle due to limited temporal and spatial perspectives. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative. Having been trained on a large text corpus describing human behaviors, LLMs likely encode plausible sequences of human actions in a home environment. However, LLMs, trained primarily on text data, lack inherent spatial awareness and real-time environmental perception. They struggle with understanding physical constraints and spatial geometry. Therefore, to be effective in a real-world spatial scenario, we propose a multimodal prediction framework that enhances LLM-based action prediction by integrating physical constraints derived from human trajectories. Our experiments demonstrate that combining LLM predictions with trajectory data significantly improves overall prediction performance. This enhancement is particularly notable in situations where the LLM receives limited scene information, highlighting the complementary nature of linguistic knowledge and physical constraints in understanding and anticipating human behavior.</p></details> |  |

This approach is the first of its kind to be applied to spatiotemporal data. By embedding $2+1$-dimensional spatiotemporal data into $\mathbb{R}^3$, we utilize persistent homology to detect loops within the trajectories in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Our research reveals that, under normal conditions, trajectory data embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ over time do not form loops. Consequently, we can effectively identify anomalies characterized by the presence of loops within the trajectories. This method is robust and capable of detecting loops that are invariant to small perturbations, variations in geometric shape, and local coordinate projections. Additionally, our approach provides a novel perspective on anomaly detection, offering enhanced sensitivity and specificity in identifying atypical patterns in geospatial data. This approach has significant implications for various applications, including maritime navigation, environmental monitoring, and surveillance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Title...</summary><p>Title: Identification of Anomalous Geospatial Trajectories via Persistent Homology Authors: Kyle Evans-Lee, Kevin Lamb Comments: 18 pages, 12 figures We present a method for analyzing geospatial trajectory data using topological data analysis (TDA) to identify a specific class of anomalies, commonly referred to as crop circles, in AIS data</p></details> |
| **[DOTS: Learning to Reason Dynamically in LLMs via Optimal Reasoning Trajectories Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03864v1)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the capability of large language models (LLMs) in reasoning has gained significant attention in recent years. Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of various prompting strategies in aiding LLMs in reasoning (called "reasoning actions"), such as step-by-step thinking, reflecting before answering, solving with programs, and their combinations. However, these approaches often applied static, predefined reasoning actions uniformly to all questions, without considering the specific characteristics of each question or the capability of the task-solving LLM. In this paper, we propose DOTS, an approach enabling LLMs to reason dynamically via optimal reasoning trajectory search, tailored to the specific characteristics of each question and the inherent capability of the task-solving LLM. Our approach involves three key steps: i) defining atomic reasoning action modules that can be composed into various reasoning action trajectories; ii) searching for the optimal action trajectory for each training question through iterative exploration and evaluation for the specific task-solving LLM; and iii) using the collected optimal trajectories to train an LLM to plan for the reasoning trajectories of unseen questions. In particular, we propose two learning paradigms, i.e., fine-tuning an external LLM as a planner to guide the task-solving LLM, or directly fine-tuning the task-solving LLM with an internalized capability for reasoning actions planning. Our experiments across eight reasoning tasks show that our method consistently outperforms static reasoning techniques and the vanilla instruction tuning approach. Further analysis reveals that our method enables LLMs to adjust their computation based on problem complexity, allocating deeper thinking and reasoning to harder problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topology-Driven Parallel Trajectory Optimization in Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06021v2)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ground robots navigating in complex, dynamic environments must compute collision-free trajectories to avoid obstacles safely and efficiently. Nonconvex optimization is a popular method to compute a trajectory in real-time. However, these methods often converge to locally optimal solutions and frequently switch between different local minima, leading to inefficient and unsafe robot motion. In this work, We propose a novel topology-driven trajectory optimization strategy for dynamic environments that plans multiple distinct evasive trajectories to enhance the robot's behavior and efficiency. A global planner iteratively generates trajectories in distinct homotopy classes. These trajectories are then optimized by local planners working in parallel. While each planner shares the same navigation objectives, they are locally constrained to a specific homotopy class, meaning each local planner attempts a different evasive maneuver. The robot then executes the feasible trajectory with the lowest cost in a receding horizon manner. We demonstrate, on a mobile robot navigating among pedestrians, that our approach leads to faster and safer trajectories than existing planners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |
| **[Safe and Efficient Trajectory Optimization for Autonomous Vehicles using B-spline with Incremental Path Flattening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02957v4)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gradient-based trajectory optimization with B-spline curves is widely used for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) due to its fast convergence and continuous trajectory generation. However, the application of B-spline curves for path-velocity coupled trajectory planning in autonomous vehicles (AVs) has been highly limited because it is challenging to reduce the over-approximation of the vehicle shape and to create a collision-free trajectory using B-spline curves while satisfying kinodynamic constraints. To address these challenges, this paper proposes novel disc-type swept volume (SV), incremental path flattening (IPF), and kinodynamic feasibility penalty methods. The disc-type SV estimation method is a new technique to reduce SV over-approximation and is used to find collision points for IPF. In IPF, the collision points are used to push the trajectory away from obstacles and to iteratively increase the curvature weight, thereby reducing SV and generating a collision-free trajectory. Additionally, to satisfy kinodynamic constraints for AVs using B-spline curves, we apply a clamped B-spline curvature penalty along with longitudinal and lateral velocity and acceleration penalties. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various simulated environments. We also conducted a real-world experiment using an AV, and our results validate the simulated tracking performance of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 21 figures, 5 tables, 3 algorithms</p></details> |
| **[Learning a Fast Mixing Exogenous Block MDP using a Single Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03016v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In order to train agents that can quickly adapt to new objectives or reward functions, efficient unsupervised representation learning in sequential decision-making environments can be important. Frameworks such as the Exogenous Block Markov Decision Process (Ex-BMDP) have been proposed to formalize this representation-learning problem (Efroni et al., 2022b). In the Ex-BMDP framework, the agent's high-dimensional observations of the environment have two latent factors: a controllable factor, which evolves deterministically within a small state space according to the agent's actions, and an exogenous factor, which represents time-correlated noise, and can be highly complex. The goal of the representation learning problem is to learn an encoder that maps from observations into the controllable latent space, as well as the dynamics of this space. Efroni et al. (2022b) has shown that this is possible with a sample complexity that depends only on the size of the controllable latent space, and not on the size of the noise factor. However, this prior work has focused on the episodic setting, where the controllable latent state resets to a specific start state after a finite horizon. By contrast, if the agent can only interact with the environment in a single continuous trajectory, prior works have not established sample-complexity bounds. We propose STEEL, the first provably sample-efficient algorithm for learning the controllable dynamics of an Ex-BMDP from a single trajectory, in the function approximation setting. STEEL has a sample complexity that depends only on the sizes of the controllable latent space and the encoder function class, and (at worst linearly) on the mixing time of the exogenous noise factor. We prove that STEEL is correct and sample-efficient, and demonstrate STEEL on two toy problems. Code is available at: https://github.com/midi-lab/steel.</p></details> |  |

The challenge arises from the non-convex nature of the optimization problem with multiple local optima, which usually requires a global search. Traditional numerical solvers struggle to find diverse solutions efficiently without appropriate initial guesses. In this paper, we introduce DiffuSolve, a general diffusion model-based solver for non-convex trajectory optimization. An expressive diffusion model is trained on pre-collected locally optimal solutions and efficiently samples initial guesses, which then warm-starts numerical solvers to fine-tune the feasibility and optimality. We also present DiffuSolve+, a novel constrained diffusion model with an additional loss in training that further reduces the problem constraint violations of diffusion samples. Experimental evaluations on three tasks verify the improved robustness, diversity, and a 2$\times$ to 11$\times$ increase in computational efficiency with our proposed method, which generalizes well to trajectory optimization problems of varying challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization with Global Yaw Parameterization for Field-of-View Constrained Autonomous Flight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17067v2)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory generation for quadrotors with limited field-of-view sensors has numerous applications such as aerial exploration, coverage, inspection, videography, and target tracking. Most previous works simplify the task of optimizing yaw trajectories by either aligning the heading of the robot with its velocity, or potentially restricting the feasible space of candidate trajectories by using a limited yaw domain to circumvent angular singularities. In this paper, we propose a novel \textit{global} yaw parameterization method for trajectory optimization that allows a 360-degree yaw variation as demanded by the underlying algorithm. This approach effectively bypasses inherent singularities by including supplementary quadratic constraints and transforming the final decision variables into the desired state representation. This method significantly reduces the needed control effort, and improves optimization feasibility. Furthermore, we apply the method to several examples of different applications that require jointly optimizing over both the yaw and position trajectories. Ultimately, we present a comprehensive numerical analysis and evaluation of our proposed method in both simulation and real-world experiments.</p></details> |  |

The number of features is comparable to the sample size and errors may be heavy-tailed. We introduce estimators that precisely track the generalization error of the iterates along the trajectory of the iterative algorithm. These estimators are provably consistent under suitable conditions. The results are illustrated through several examples, including Huber regression, pseudo-Huber regression, and their penalized variants with non-smooth regularizer. We provide explicit generalization error estimates for iterates generated from GD and SGD, or from proximal SGD in the presence of a non-smooth regularizer. The proposed risk estimates serve as effective proxies for the actual generalization error, allowing us to determine the optimal stopping iteration that minimizes the generalization error. Extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed generalization error estimates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Remember and Recall: Associative-Memory-based Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02201v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a pivotal component of autonomous driving systems, enabling the application of accumulated movement experience to current scenarios. Although most existing methods concentrate on learning continuous representations to gain valuable experience, they often suffer from computational inefficiencies and struggle with unfamiliar situations. To address this issue, we propose the Fragmented-Memory-based Trajectory Prediction (FMTP) model, inspired by the remarkable learning capabilities of humans, particularly their ability to leverage accumulated experience and recall relevant memories in unfamiliar situations. The FMTP model employs discrete representations to enhance computational efficiency by reducing information redundancy while maintaining the flexibility to utilize past experiences. Specifically, we design a learnable memory array by consolidating continuous trajectory representations from the training set using defined quantization operations during the training phase. This approach further eliminates redundant information while preserving essential features in discrete form. Additionally, we develop an advanced reasoning engine based on language models to deeply learn the associative rules among these discrete representations. Our method has been evaluated on various public datasets, including ETH-UCY, inD, SDD, nuScenes, Waymo, and VTL-TP. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significant performance and extracts more valuable experience from past trajectories to inform the current state.</p></details> |  |

This poses challenges for classical time-series models that require equally spaced data. To address this, we propose a novel time-series Transformer called Trajectory Generative Pre-trained Transformer (TrajGPT). TrajGPT employs a novel Selective Recurrent Attention (SRA) mechanism, which utilizes a data-dependent decay to adaptively filter out irrelevant past information based on contexts. By interpreting TrajGPT as discretized ordinary differential equations (ODEs), it effectively captures the underlying continuous dynamics and enables time-specific inference for forecasting arbitrary target timesteps. Experimental results demonstrate that TrajGPT excels in trajectory forecasting, drug usage prediction, and phenotype classification without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. By evolving the learned continuous dynamics, TrajGPT can interpolate and extrapolate disease risk trajectories from partially-observed time series. The visualization of predicted health trajectories shows that TrajGPT forecasts unseen diseases based on the history of clinically relevant phenotypes (i.e., contexts).</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Equality Constrained Diffusion for Direct Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01939v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent success of diffusion-based generative models in image and natural language processing has ignited interest in diffusion-based trajectory optimization for nonlinear control systems. Existing methods cannot, however, handle the nonlinear equality constraints necessary for direct trajectory optimization. As a result, diffusion-based trajectory optimizers are currently limited to shooting methods, where the nonlinear dynamics are enforced by forward rollouts. This precludes many of the benefits enjoyed by direct methods, including flexible state constraints, reduced numerical sensitivity, and easy initial guess specification. In this paper, we present a method for diffusion-based optimization with equality constraints. This allows us to perform direct trajectory optimization, enforcing dynamic feasibility with constraints rather than rollouts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first diffusion-based optimization algorithm that supports the general nonlinear equality constraints required for direct trajectory optimization.</p></details> |  |

Recently, C-ADMM has been studied in robotics applications such as multi-vehicle target tracking and collaborative manipulation tasks. However, few works have investigated the performance of C-ADMM applied to non-convex problems in robotics applications due to a lack of theoretical guarantees. For this project, we aim to quantitatively explore and examine the convergence behavior of non-convex C-ADMM through the scope of distributed multi-robot trajectory planning. We propose a convex trajectory planning problem by leveraging C-ADMM and Buffered Voronoi Cells (BVCs) to get around the non-convex collision avoidance constraint and compare this convex C-ADMM algorithm to a non-convex C-ADMM baseline with non-convex collision avoidance constraints. We show that the convex C-ADMM algorithm requires 1000 fewer iterations to achieve convergence in a multi-robot waypoint navigation scenario. We also confirm that the non-convex C-ADMM baseline leads to sub-optimal solutions and violation of safety constraints in trajectory generation.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we address the problem of one-shot imitation from a single human demonstration, given by an RGB-D video recording. We propose a two-stage process. In the first stage we extract the demonstration trajectory offline. This entails segmenting manipulated objects and determining their relative motion in relation to secondary objects such as containers. In the online trajectory generation stage, we first re-detect all objects, then warp the demonstration trajectory to the current scene and execute it on the robot. To complete these steps, our method leverages several ancillary models, including those for segmentation, relative object pose estimation, and grasp prediction. We systematically evaluate different combinations of correspondence and re-detection methods to validate our design decision across a diverse range of tasks. Specifically, we collect and quantitatively test on demonstrations of ten different tasks including pick-and-place tasks as well as articulated object manipulation. Finally, we perform extensive evaluations on a real robot system to demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of our approach in real-world scenarios.

This approach utilizes the contact-implicit differential dynamic programming (DDP) framework, merging the hard contact model with a linear complementarity constraint. We propose the analytical gradient of the contact impulse based on relaxed complementarity constraints to further the exploration of a variety of contact modes. By leveraging a hard contact model-based simulation and computation of search direction through a smooth gradient, our methodology identifies dynamically feasible state trajectories, control inputs, and contact forces while simultaneously unveiling new contact mode sequences. However, the broadened scope of contact modes does not always ensure real-world applicability. Recognizing this, we implemented differentiable cost terms to guide foot trajectories and make gait patterns. Furthermore, to address the challenge of unstable initial roll-outs in an MPC setting, we employ the multiple shooting variant of DDP. The efficacy of the proposed framework is validated through simulations and real-world demonstrations using a 45 kg HOUND quadruped robot, performing various tasks in simulation and showcasing actual experiments involving a forward trot and a front-leg rearing motion.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the accepted version for The International Journal of Robotics Research (2024); published version at https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02783649241273645 / Videos at https://youtu.be/SXD4BJIfyoY</p></details> |

However, such data is also highly sensitive, rendering them susceptible to privacy risks in the event of mismanagement, for example, revealing an individual's identity, home address, or political affiliations. Hence, ensuring that privacy is preserved for this data is a priority. One commonly taken measure to mitigate this concern is aggregation. Previous work by Xu et al. shows that trajectories are still recoverable from anonymised and aggregated datasets. However, the study lacks implementation details, obfuscating the mechanisms of the attack. Additionally, the attack was evaluated on commercial non-public datasets, rendering the results and subsequent claims unverifiable. This study reimplements the trajectory recovery attack from scratch and evaluates it on two open-source datasets, detailing the preprocessing steps and implementation. Results confirm that privacy leakage still exists despite common anonymisation and aggregation methods but also indicate that the initial accuracy claims may have been overly ambitious. We release all code as open-source to ensure the results are entirely reproducible and, therefore, verifiable. Moreover, we propose a stronger attack by designing a series of enhancements to the baseline attack. These enhancements yield higher accuracies by up to 16%, providing an improved benchmark for future research in trajectory recovery methods. Our improvements also enable online execution of the attack, allowing partial attacks on larger datasets previously considered unprocessable, thereby furthering the extent of privacy leakage. The findings emphasise the importance of using strong privacy-preserving mechanisms when releasing aggregated mobility data and not solely relying on aggregation as a means of anonymisation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 17th International Conference on Security of Information and Networks (SIN'24).

| **[Algorithmic Considerations for Effective Global Search of Robust Low-Thrust Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00297v1)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing interest in the cislunar domain over the past decade has led to an increasing demand for low-thrust missions to key orbits within this region. These low-thrust missions, typically characterized by long thrust arcs, are highly susceptible to operational disruptions such as unforeseen thruster outages or missed thrust events. Consequently, there is a critical need for efficient trajectory design frameworks which incorporate robustness against such anomalies. In this study, we utilize a robust trajectory design framework to explore the solution space for the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) module to the Earth-Moon L2 Southern 9:2 Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit. We propose algorithmic enhancements to improve the global search for robust solutions, and present a comprehensive analysis of two approaches: a nonconditional approach which involves a purely random search for robust solutions versus a conditional approach which involves warm-starting the search for robust solutions using the non-robust solutions. Our results indicate that by using non-robust solutions as initial guesses for the robust solutions, it is possible to achieve significant improvements in both the rate of convergence and the robustness of the final solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript was submitted to Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics.

| **[A Historical Trajectory Assisted Optimization Method for Zeroth-Order Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15955v3)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning heavily relies on distributed gradient descent techniques. In the situation where gradient information is not available, the gradients need to be estimated from zeroth-order information, which typically involves computing finite-differences along isotropic random directions. This method suffers from high estimation errors, as the geometric features of the objective landscape may be overlooked during the isotropic sampling. In this work, we propose a non-isotropic sampling method to improve the gradient estimation procedure. Gradients in our method are estimated in a subspace spanned by historical trajectories of solutions, aiming to encourage the exploration of promising regions and hence improve the convergence. The proposed method uses a covariance matrix for sampling which is a convex combination of two parts. The first part is a thin projection matrix containing the basis of the subspace which is designed to improve the exploitation ability. The second part is the historical trajectories. We implement this method in zeroth-order federated settings, and show that the convergence rate aligns with existing ones while introducing no significant overheads in communication or local computation. The effectiveness of our proposal is verified on several numerical experiments in comparison to several commonly-used zeroth-order federated optimization algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages with theoretical proof</p></details> |
| **[CVVLSNet: Vehicle Location and Speed Estimation Using Partial Connected Vehicle Trajectory Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00132v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time estimation of vehicle locations and speeds is crucial for developing many beneficial transportation applications in traffic management and control, e.g., adaptive signal control. Recent advances in communication technologies facilitate the emergence of connected vehicles (CVs), which can share traffic information with nearby CVs or infrastructures. At the early stage of connectivity, only a portion of vehicles are CVs. The locations and speeds for those non-CVs (NCs) are not accessible and must be estimated to obtain the full traffic information. To address the above problem, this paper proposes a novel CV-based Vehicle Location and Speed estimation network, CVVLSNet, to simultaneously estimate the vehicle locations and speeds exclusively using partial CV trajectory data. A road cell occupancy (RCO) method is first proposed to represent the variable vehicle state information. Spatiotemporal interactions can be integrated by simply fusing the RCO representations. Then, CVVLSNet, taking the Coding-RAte TransformEr (CRATE) network as a backbone, is introduced to estimate the vehicle locations and speeds. Moreover, physical vehicle size constraints are also considered in loss functions. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed method significantly outperformed the existing method under various CV penetration rates, signal timings, and volume-to-capacity ratios.</p></details> |  |

However, they face challenges due to their high-dimensional and unstable dynamics, as well as the complex contact-rich nature of the tasks. Model-based optimal control methods offer precise and systematic control but are limited by high computational complexity and accurate contact sensing. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) provides robustness and handles high-dimensional spaces but suffers from inefficient learning, unnatural motion, and sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Opt2Skill, an end-to-end pipeline that combines model-based trajectory optimization with RL to achieve robust whole-body loco-manipulation. We generate reference motions for the Digit humanoid robot using differential dynamic programming (DDP) and train RL policies to track these trajectories. Our results demonstrate that Opt2Skill outperforms pure RL methods in both training efficiency and task performance, with optimal trajectories that account for torque limits enhancing trajectory tracking. We successfully transfer our approach to real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

With the growing population of blind and visually impaired individuals, the need for intelligent assistive tools that provide real-time warnings about potential collisions with dynamic obstacles is becoming critical. These systems rely on algorithms capable of predicting the trajectories of moving objects, such as pedestrians, to issue timely hazard alerts. However, existing datasets fail to capture the necessary information from the perspective of a blind individual. To address this gap, HEADS-UP offers a novel dataset focused on trajectory prediction in this context. Leveraging this dataset, we propose a semi-local trajectory prediction approach to assess collision risks between blind individuals and pedestrians in dynamic environments. Unlike conventional methods that separately predict the trajectories of both the blind individual (ego agent) and pedestrians, our approach operates within a semi-local coordinate system, a rotated version of the camera's coordinate system, facilitating the prediction process. We validate our method on the HEADS-UP dataset and implement the proposed solution in ROS, performing real-time tests on an NVIDIA Jetson GPU through a user study. Results from both dataset evaluations and live tests demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our approach.</p></details> |  |

In the Violina framework, we optimize the coefficient matrices of state-space model and memory kernel in the given space using a projected gradient descent method so that its model prediction matches the set of multiple observed data. Using Violina we can identify a linear non-Markovian dynamical system with constraints corresponding to a priori knowledge on the model parameters and memory effects. Using synthetic data, we numerically demonstrate that the Markovian and non-Markovian state-space models identified by the proposed method have considerably better generalization performances compared to the models identified by an existing dynamic decomposition-based method.</p></details> |  |
| **[ICAL: Continual Learning of Multimodal Agents by Transforming Trajectories into Actionable Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14596v2)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale generative language and vision-language models (LLMs and VLMs) excel in few-shot in-context learning for decision making and instruction following. However, they require high-quality exemplar demonstrations to be included in their context window. In this work, we ask: Can LLMs and VLMs generate their own prompt examples from generic, sub-optimal demonstrations? We propose In-Context Abstraction Learning (ICAL), a method that builds a memory of multimodal experience insights from sub-optimal demonstrations and human feedback. Given a noisy demonstration in a new domain, VLMs abstract the trajectory into a general program by fixing inefficient actions and annotating cognitive abstractions: task relationships, object state changes, temporal subgoals, and task construals. These abstractions are refined and adapted interactively through human feedback while the agent attempts to execute the trajectory in a similar environment. The resulting abstractions, when used as exemplars in the prompt, significantly improve decision-making in retrieval-augmented LLM and VLM agents. Our ICAL agent surpasses the state-of-the-art in dialogue-based instruction following in TEACh, multimodal web agents in VisualWebArena, and action anticipation in Ego4D. In TEACh, we achieve a 12.6% improvement in goal-condition success. In VisualWebArena, our task success rate improves over the SOTA from 18.9% to 23.4%. In Ego4D action forecasting, we improve over few-shot GPT-4V and remain competitive with supervised models. We show finetuning our retrieval-augmented in-context agent yields additional improvements. Our approach significantly reduces reliance on expert-crafted examples and consistently outperforms in-context learning from action plans that lack such insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: http://ical-learning.github.io/</p></details> |

Human behavior typically follows a pattern of normalcy in day-to-day activities. This is marked by recurring activities within specific time periods. In this paper, we model this behavior using Reeb graphs where any deviation from usual day-to-day activities is encoded as nodes in the Reeb graph. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear with respect to the number of time points in a given trajectory. We demonstrate the usage of ReeSPOT and how it captures the critically significant spatial and temporal deviations using the nodes of the Reeb graph. Our case study presented in this paper includes realistic human movement scenarios: visiting uncommon locations, taking odd routes at infrequent times, uncommon time visits, and uncommon stay durations. We analyze the Reeb graph to interpret the topological structure of the GPS trajectories. Potential applications of ReeSPOT include urban planning, security surveillance, and behavioral research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Trajectory Replanning for Mars Ascent Vehicle under Propulsion System Faults: A Suboptimal Learning-Based Warm-Start Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19536v1)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>During the Mars ascent vehicle (MAV) launch missions, when encountering a thrust drop type of propulsion system fault problem, the general trajectory replanning methods relying on step-by-step judgments may fail to make timely decisions, potentially leading to mission failure. This paper proposes a suboptimal joint trajectory replanning (SJTR) method, which formulates the joint optimization problem of target orbit and flight trajectory after a fault within a convex optimization framework. By incorporating penalty coefficients for terminal constraints, the optimization solution adheres to the orbit redecision principle, thereby avoiding complex decision-making processes and resulting in a concise and rapid solution to the replanning problem. A learning-based warm-start scheme is proposed in conjunction with the designed SJTR method. Offline, a deep neural network (DNN) is trained using a dataset generated by the SJTR method. Online, the DNN provides initial guesses for the time optimization variables based on the current fault situation, enhancing the solving efficiency and reliability of the algorithm. Numerical simulations of the MAV flight scenario under the thrust drop faults are performed, and Monte Carlo experiments and case studies across all orbit types demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-time Planning of Minimum-time Trajectories for Agile UAV Flight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16074v2)** | 2024-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the challenge of real-time planning of minimum-time trajectories over multiple waypoints, onboard multirotor UAVs. Previous works demonstrated that achieving a truly time-optimal trajectory is computationally too demanding to enable frequent replanning during agile flight, especially on less powerful flight computers. Our approach overcomes this stumbling block by utilizing a point-mass model with a novel iterative thrust decomposition algorithm, enabling the UAV to use all of its collective thrust, something previous point-mass approaches could not achieve. The approach enables gravity and drag modeling integration, significantly reducing tracking errors in high-speed trajectories, which is proven through an ablation study. When combined with a new multi-waypoint optimization algorithm, which uses a gradient-based method to converge to optimal velocities in waypoints, the proposed method generates minimum-time multi-waypoint trajectories within milliseconds. The proposed approach, which we provide as open-source package, is validated both in simulation and in real-world, using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control. With accelerations of up to 3.5g and speeds over 100 km/h, trajectories generated by the proposed method yield similar or even smaller tracking errors than the trajectories generated for a full multirotor model.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods have attempted to mitigate this problem by employing traditional LSTM architectures, but these approaches often suffer from inefficiencies in processing large datasets. In response to this challenge, we propose VecLSTM, a novel framework that enhances the performance and efficiency of LSTM-based neural networks. Unlike conventional approaches, VecLSTM incorporates vectorization layers, leveraging optimized mathematical operations to process input sequences more efficiently. We have implemented VecLSTM and incorporated it into the MySQL database. To evaluate the effectiveness of VecLSTM, we compare its performance against a conventional LSTM model using a dataset comprising 1,467,652 samples with seven unique labels. Experimental results demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art, with VecLSTM achieving a validation accuracy of 85.57\%, a test accuracy of 85.47\%, and a weighted F1-score of 0.86. Furthermore, VecLSTM significantly reduces training time, offering a 26.2\% reduction compared to traditional LSTM models.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Kinematic Detection of Anomalies in Human Trajectory Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19136v1)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Historically, much of the research in understanding, modeling, and mining human trajectory data has focused on where an individual stays. Thus, the focus of existing research has been on where a user goes. On the other hand, the study of how a user moves between locations has great potential for new research opportunities. Kinematic features describe how an individual moves between locations and can be used for tasks such as identification of individuals or anomaly detection. Unfortunately, data availability and quality challenges make kinematic trajectory mining difficult. In this paper, we leverage the Geolife dataset of human trajectories to investigate the viability of using kinematic features to identify individuals and detect anomalies. We show that humans have an individual "kinematic profile" which can be used as a strong signal to identify individual humans. We experimentally show that, for the two use-cases of individual identification and anomaly detection, simple kinematic features fed to standard classification and anomaly detection algorithms significantly improve results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Trajectory Optimization Framework for Differential Drive Robot Class](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07924v2)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential drive robots are widely used in various scenarios thanks to their straightforward principle, from household service robots to disaster response field robots. There are several types of driving mechanisms for real-world applications, including two-wheeled, four-wheeled skid-steering, tracked robots, and so on. The differences in the driving mechanisms usually require specific kinematic modeling when precise control is desired. Furthermore, the nonholonomic dynamics and possible lateral slip lead to different degrees of difficulty in getting feasible and high-quality trajectories. Therefore, a comprehensive trajectory optimization framework to compute trajectories efficiently for various kinds of differential drive robots is highly desirable. In this paper, we propose a universal trajectory optimization framework that can be applied to differential drive robots, enabling the generation of high-quality trajectories within a restricted computational timeframe. We introduce a novel trajectory representation based on polynomial parameterization of motion states or their integrals, such as angular and linear velocities, which inherently matches the robots' motion to the control principle. The trajectory optimization problem is formulated to minimize complexity while prioritizing safety and operational efficiency. We then build a full-stack autonomous planning and control system to demonstrate its feasibility and robustness. We conduct extensive simulations and real-world testing in crowded environments with three kinds of differential drive robots to validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 15 pages, 15 figures |

However, the high volume, noise, and lack of semantic information in this data poses challenges for storage, analysis, and applications. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end pipeline named CycleTrajectory for processing high-sampling rate GPS trajectory data from action cameras, leveraging OpenStreetMap (OSM) for semantic enrichment. The methodology includes (1) Data Preparation, which includes filtration, noise removal, and resampling; (2) Map Matching, which accurately aligns GPS points with road segments using the OSRM API; (3) OSM Data integration to enrich trajectories with road infrastructure details; and (4) Variable Calculation to derive metrics like distance, speed, and infrastructure usage. Validation of the map matching results shows an error rate of 5.64%, indicating the reliability of this pipeline. This approach enhances efficient GPS data preparation and facilitates a deeper understanding of cycling behavior and the cycling environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2nd ACM SIGSPATIAL Workshop on Sustainable Urban Mobility (SUMob 2024)</p></details> |

Methods for trajectory classification are particularly important to detect different movement patterns, while methods for regression to compute motility metrics and forecasting. Recent advances in computer vision have facilitated the processing of trajectories rendered as images via artificial neural networks with 2d convolutional layers (CNNs). This approach leverages the capability of CNNs to learn spatial hierarchies of features from images, necessary to recognize complex shapes. Moreover, it overcomes the limitation of other machine learning methods that require input trajectories with a fixed number of points. However, rendering trajectories as images can introduce poorly investigated artifacts such as information loss due to the plotting of coordinates on a discrete grid, and spectral changes due to line thickness and aliasing. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of CNNs for solving classification and regression problems from synthetic trajectories that have been rendered as images using different modalities. The parameters considered in this study include line thickness, image resolution, usage of motion history (color-coding of the temporal component) and anti-aliasing. Results highlight the importance of choosing an appropriate image resolution according to model depth and motion history in applications where movement direction is critical.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

However, many trajectory prediction models produce unreasonable trajectory samples that focus on improving diversity or accuracy while neglecting other key requirements, such as collision avoidance with the surrounding environment. In this work, we propose TrajDiffuse, a planning-based trajectory prediction method using a novel guided conditional diffusion model. We form the trajectory prediction problem as a denoising impaint task and design a map-based guidance term for the diffusion process. TrajDiffuse is able to generate trajectory predictions that match or exceed the accuracy and diversity of the SOTA, while adhering almost perfectly to environmental constraints. We demonstrate the utility of our model through experiments on the nuScenes and PFSD datasets and provide an extensive benchmark analysis against the SOTA methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published as inpreceedings of the 2024 International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a novel computationally efficient approach for trajectory optimization on matrix Lie groups using an augmented Lagrangian-based constrained discrete Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP). The method involves lifting the optimization problem to the Lie algebra during the backward pass and retracting back to the manifold during the forward pass. Unlike previous approaches that addressed constraint handling only for specific classes of matrix Lie groups, the proposed method provides a general solution for nonlinear constraint handling across generic matrix Lie groups. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed DDP method in handling constraints within a mechanical system characterized by rigid body dynamics in SE(3), assessing its computational efficiency compared to existing direct optimization solvers. Additionally, the method demonstrates robustness under external disturbances when applied as a Lie-algebraic feedback control policy on SE(3), and in optimizing a quadrotor's trajectory in a challenging realistic scenario. Experiments show that the proposed approach effectively manages general constraints defined on configuration, velocity, and inputs during optimization, while also maintaining stability under external disturbances when executing the resultant control policy in closed-loop.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

However, existing control methods still face two limitations: Firstly, control conditions (such as depth maps, 3D Mesh) are difficult for ordinary users to obtain directly. Secondly, it's challenging to drive multiple objects through complex motions with multiple trajectories simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce DragEntity, a video generation model that utilizes entity representation for controlling the motion of multiple objects. Compared to previous methods, DragEntity offers two main advantages: 1) Our method is more user-friendly for interaction because it allows users to drag entities within the image rather than individual pixels. 2) We use entity representation to represent any object in the image, and multiple objects can maintain relative spatial relationships. Therefore, we allow multiple trajectories to control multiple objects in the image with different levels of complexity simultaneously. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of DragEntity, demonstrating its excellent performance in fine-grained control in video generation.</p></details> | ACM MM2024 Oral |

Prior works typically neglect to maintain uncertainty about occluded objects and only predict trajectories of observed objects using high-capacity models such as Transformers trained on large datasets. While these approaches are effective in standard scenarios, they can struggle to generalize to the long-tail, safety-critical scenarios. In this work, we explore a conceptual framework unifying trajectory prediction and occlusion reasoning under the same class of structured probabilistic generative model, namely, switching dynamical systems. We then present some initial experiments illustrating its capabilities using the Waymo open dataset.</p></details> |  |

Ergodic trajectory optimization is an effective approach that generates coverage paths for problems related to robotic inspection, information gathering problems, and search and rescue. These optimization schemes compel the robot to spend time in a region proportional to the expected utility of visiting that region. Current methods for ergodic trajectory optimization rely on domain-specific knowledge, e.g., a defined utility map, and well-defined spatial basis functions to produce ergodic trajectories. Here, we present a generalization of ergodic trajectory optimization based on maximum mean discrepancy that requires only samples from the search domain. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to produce coverage trajectories on a variety of problem domains including robotic inspection of objects with differential kinematics constraints and on Lie groups without having access to domain specific knowledge. Furthermore, we show favorable computational scaling compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for ergodic trajectory optimization with a trade-off between domain specific knowledge and computational scaling, thus extending the versatility of ergodic coverage on a wider application domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages (excluding references), 1 table, 8 figures, submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[On the Distribution of Probe Traffic Volume Estimated without Trajectory Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15274v2)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, passively recorded probe traffic volumes have increasingly been used to estimate traffic volumes. However, it is not always possible to count probe traffic volume in a spatial dataset when probe trajectories cannot be fully reconstructed from raw probe point location data due to sparse recording intervals, lack of pseudonyms or timestamps. As a result, the application of such probe point location data has been limited in traffic volume estimation. To relax these constraints, we present the exact distribution of the estimated probe traffic volume in a road segment based on probe point location data without trajectory reconstruction. The distribution of the estimated probe traffic volume can exhibit multimodality, without necessarily being line-symmetric with respect to the true probe traffic volume. As more probes are present, the distribution approaches a normal distribution. The conformity of the distribution was visualised through numerical simulations. Sometimes, there exists a local optimal cordon length that maximises estimation precision. The theoretical variance of estimated probe traffic volume can address heteroscedasticity in the modelling of traffic volume estimates.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |

Here we examine a zoo of diffusion-based inpainting methods on a specific dataset of corrupted images, which represent incomplete Euclidean distance matrices (EDMs) of fBm at various memory exponents $H$. Our dataset implies uniqueness of the data imputation in the regime of low missing ratio, where the remaining partial graph is rigid, providing the ground truth for the inpainting. We find that the conditional diffusion generation readily reproduces the built-in correlations of fBm paths in different memory regimes (i.e., for sub-, Brownian and super-diffusion trajectories), providing a robust tool for the statistical imputation at high missing ratio. Furthermore, while diffusion models have been recently shown to memorize samples from the training database, we demonstrate that diffusion behaves qualitatively different from the database search and thus generalize rather than memorize the training dataset. As a biological application, we apply our fBm-trained diffusion model for the imputation of microscopy-derived distance matrices of chromosomal segments (FISH data) - incomplete due to experimental imperfections - and demonstrate its superiority over the standard approaches used in bioinformatics.</p></details> |  |

In particular, the proposed motion factorization strategy can facilitate to implicitly characterize the high-dimensional visual signal into compact motion vectors for representation compactness and further transform these vectors into a fine-grained field for motion expressibility. As such, the coded bit-stream can be entailed with enough visual motion information at the lowest representation cost. Meanwhile, a resolution-expandable generative module is developed with enhanced background stability, such that the proposed framework can be optimized towards higher reconstruction robustness and more flexible resolution adaptation. Experimental results show that proposed method outperforms latest generative models and the state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video Coding (VVC) on both talking-face videos and moving-body videos in terms of both objective and subjective quality.

| **[DiffuTraj: A Stochastic Vessel Trajectory Prediction Approach via Guided Diffusion Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09550v1)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maritime vessel maneuvers, characterized by their inherent complexity and indeterminacy, requires vessel trajectory prediction system capable of modeling the multi-modality nature of future motion states. Conventional stochastic trajectory prediction methods utilize latent variables to represent the multi-modality of vessel motion, however, tends to overlook the complexity and dynamics inherent in maritime behavior. In contrast, we explicitly simulate the transition of vessel motion from uncertainty towards a state of certainty, effectively handling future indeterminacy in dynamic scenes. In this paper, we present a novel framework (\textit{DiffuTraj}) to conceptualize the trajectory prediction task as a guided reverse process of motion pattern uncertainty diffusion, in which we progressively remove uncertainty from maritime regions to delineate the intended trajectory. Specifically, we encode the previous states of the target vessel, vessel-vessel interactions, and the environment context as guiding factors for trajectory generation. Subsequently, we devise a transformer-based conditional denoiser to capture spatio-temporal dependencies, enabling the generation of trajectories better aligned for particular maritime environment. Comprehensive experiments on vessel trajectory prediction benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>conta...</summary><p>containing 14pages, 9 figures and 3 tables; Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems on 17-June-2024</p></details> |
| **[The Indirect Method for Generating Libraries of Optimal Periodic Trajectories and Its Application to Economical Bipedal Walking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09512v1)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory optimization is an essential tool for generating efficient and dynamically consistent gaits in legged locomotion. This paper explores the indirect method of trajectory optimization, emphasizing its application in creating optimal periodic gaits for legged systems and contrasting it with the more commonly used direct method. While the direct method provides considerable flexibility in its implementation, it is limited by its input space parameterization. In contrast, the indirect method improves accuracy by defining control inputs as functions of the system's states and costates. We tackle the convergence challenges associated with indirect shooting methods, particularly through the systematic development of gait libraries by utilizing numerical continuation methods. Our contributions include: (1) the formalization of a general periodic trajectory optimization problem that extends existing first-order necessary conditions for a broader range of cost functions and operating conditions; (2) a methodology for efficiently generating libraries of optimal trajectories (gaits) utilizing a single shooting approach combined with numerical continuation methods, including a novel approach for reconstructing Lagrange multipliers and costates from passive gaits; and (3) a comparative analysis of the indirect and direct shooting methods using a compass-gait walker as a case study, demonstrating the former's superior accuracy in generating optimal gaits. The findings underscore the potential of the indirect method for generating families of optimal gaits, thereby advancing the field of trajectory optimization in legged robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to the International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR)</p></details> |
| **[Motion Manifold Flow Primitives for Language-Guided Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19681v2)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing text-based robot trajectory generation models is made particularly difficult by the small dataset size, high dimensionality of the trajectory space, and the inherent complexity of the text-conditional motion distribution. Recent manifold learning-based methods have partially addressed the dimensionality and dataset size issues, but struggle with the complex text-conditional distribution. In this paper we propose a text-based trajectory generation model that attempts to address all three challenges while relying on only a handful of demonstration trajectory data. Our key idea is to leverage recent flow-based models capable of capturing complex conditional distributions, not directly in the high-dimensional trajectory space, but rather in the low-dimensional latent coordinate space of the motion manifold, with deliberately designed regularization terms to ensure smoothness of motions and robustness to text variations. We show that our Motion Manifold Flow Primitive (MMFP) framework can accurately generate qualitatively distinct motions for a wide range of text inputs, significantly outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 15 figures, under review</p></details> |

State-of-the-art human trajectory prediction methods are limited by their focus on collision avoidance and short-term planning, and their inability to model complex interactions of humans with the environment. In contrast, our approach overcomes these limitations by predicting sequences of human interactions with the environment and using this information to guide trajectory predictions over a horizon of up to 60s. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict interactions with the environment by conditioning the LLM prediction on rich contextual information about the scene. This information is given as a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph that encodes the geometry, semantics, and traversability of the environment into a hierarchical representation. We then ground these interaction sequences into multi-modal spatio-temporal distributions over human positions using a probabilistic approach based on continuous-time Markov Chains. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new semi-synthetic dataset of long-term human trajectories in complex indoor environments, which also includes annotations of human-object interactions. We show in thorough experimental evaluations that our approach achieves a 54% lower average negative log-likelihood and a 26.5% lower Best-of-20 displacement error compared to the best non-privileged (i.e., evaluated in a zero-shot fashion on the dataset) baselines for a time horizon of 60s.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

We formulate an inverse learning problem in a Stackelberg game between a leader and a follower, where each player's action is the trajectory of a dynamical system. We propose an active inverse learning method for the leader to infer which hypothesis among a finite set of candidates best describes the follower's objective function. Instead of using passively observed trajectories like existing methods, we actively maximize the differences in the follower's trajectories under different hypotheses by optimizing the leader's control inputs. Compared with uniformly random inputs, the optimized inputs accelerate the convergence of the estimated probability of different hypotheses conditioned on the follower's trajectory. We demonstrate the proposed method in a receding-horizon repeated trajectory game and simulate the results using virtual TurtleBots in Gazebo.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures.

Traditional outlier detection relies on heuristic rules, which requires domain knowledge and limits its ability to identify unseen outliers. Besides, there lacks a comprehensive approach that can jointly consider multi-modal data across spatial, temporal, and textual dimensions. Addressing the need for a domain-agnostic model, we propose the Transferable Outlier Detection for Human Semantic Trajectories (TOD4Traj) framework.TOD4Traj first introduces a modality feature unification module to align diverse data feature representations, enabling the integration of multi-modal information and enhancing transferability across different datasets. A contrastive learning module is further pro-posed for identifying regular mobility patterns both temporally and across populations, allowing for a joint detection of outliers based on individual consistency and group majority patterns. Our experimental results have shown TOD4Traj's superior performance over existing models, demonstrating its effectiveness and adaptability in detecting human trajectory outliers across various datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an accepted paper on https://sigspatial2024.sigspatial.org/accepted-papers/</p></details> |

Although many methods have been explored, they all assign correlation coefficients to surrounding agents in a purely learning-based manner. In this study, we present ASPILin, which manually selects interacting agents and calculates their correlations instead of attention scores. Surprisingly, these simple modifications can significantly improve prediction performance and substantially reduce computational costs. Additionally, ASPILin models the interacting agents at each past time step separately, rather than only modeling the interacting agents at the current time step. This clarifies the causal chain of the target agent's historical trajectory and helps the model better understand dynamic interactions. We intentionally simplified our model in other aspects, such as map encoding. Remarkably, experiments conducted on the INTERACTION, highD, and CitySim datasets demonstrate that our method is efficient and straightforward, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code:https://github.com/kkk00714/ASPILin</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a novel model for representing high dimensional spatiotemporal trajectories as sequences of discrete locations and encoding them with a Transformer-based neural network architecture. Similar to language models, our Sequence Transformer for Agent Representation Encodings (STARE) model can learn representations and structure in trajectory data through both supervisory tasks (e.g., classification), and self-supervisory tasks (e.g., masked modelling). We present experimental results on various synthetic and real trajectory datasets and show that our proposed model can learn meaningful encodings that are useful for many downstream tasks including discriminating between labels and indicating similarity between locations. Using these encodings, we also learn relationships between agents and locations present in spatiotemporal data.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, to be presented at GeoAI workshop at ACM SigSpatial 2024</p></details> |

Existing cross-domain policy transfer methods mostly aim at learning domain correspondences or corrections to facilitate policy learning, such as learning domain/task-specific discriminators, representations, or policies. This design philosophy often results in heavy model architectures or task/domain-specific modeling, lacking flexibility. This reality makes us wonder: can we directly bridge the domain gaps universally at the data level, instead of relying on complex downstream cross-domain policy transfer models? In this study, we propose the Cross-Domain Trajectory EDiting (xTED) framework that employs a specially designed diffusion model for cross-domain trajectory adaptation. Our proposed model architecture effectively captures the intricate dependencies among states, actions, and rewards, as well as the dynamics patterns within target data. By utilizing the pre-trained diffusion as a prior, source domain trajectories can be transformed to match with target domain properties while preserving original semantic information. This process implicitly corrects underlying domain gaps, enhancing state realism and dynamics reliability in the source data, and allowing flexible incorporation with various downstream policy learning methods. Despite its simplicity, xTED demonstrates superior performance in extensive simulation and real-robot experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>xTED ...</summary><p>xTED offers a novel, generic, flexible, simple and effective paradigm that casts cross-domain policy adaptation as a data pre-processing problem</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing NeRF-based SLAM with Trajectory Smoothness Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08780v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The joint optimization of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and camera trajectories has been widely applied in SLAM tasks due to its superior dense mapping quality and consistency. NeRF-based SLAM learns camera poses using constraints by implicit map representation. A widely observed phenomenon that results from the constraints of this form is jerky and physically unrealistic estimated camera motion, which in turn affects the map quality. To address this deficiency of current NeRF-based SLAM, we propose in this paper TS-SLAM (TS for Trajectory Smoothness). It introduces smoothness constraints on camera trajectories by representing them with uniform cubic B-splines with continuous acceleration that guarantees smooth camera motion. Benefiting from the differentiability and local control properties of B-splines, TS-SLAM can incrementally learn the control points end-to-end using a sliding window paradigm. Additionally, we regularize camera trajectories by exploiting the dynamics prior to further smooth trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that TS-SLAM achieves superior trajectory accuracy and improves mapping quality versus NeRF-based SLAM that does not employ the above smoothness constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear second-order dynamics describe labial constriction trajectories across languages and contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08351v1)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the dynamics of labial constriction trajectories during the production of /b/ and /m/ in English and Mandarin. We find that, across languages and contexts, the ratio of instantaneous displacement to instantaneous velocity generally follows an exponential decay curve from movement onset to movement offset. We formalize this empirical discovery in a differential equation and, in combination with an assumption of point attractor dynamics, derive a nonlinear second-order dynamical system describing labial constriction trajectories. The equation has only two parameters, T and r. T corresponds to the target state and r corresponds to movement rapidity. Thus, each of the parameters corresponds to a phonetically relevant dimension of control. Nonlinear regression demonstrates that the model provides excellent fits to individual movement trajectories. Moreover, trajectories simulated from the model qualitatively match empirical trajectories, and capture key kinematic variables like duration, peak velocity, and time to achieve peak velocity. The model constitutes a proposal for the dynamics of individual articulatory movements, and thus offers a novel foundation from which to understand additional influences on articulatory kinematics like prosody, inter-movement coordination, and stochastic noise.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Plan Maneuverable and Agile Flight Trajectory with Optimization Embedded Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07736v4)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent times, an increasing number of researchers have been devoted to utilizing deep neural networks for end-to-end flight navigation. This approach has gained traction due to its ability to bridge the gap between perception and planning that exists in traditional methods, thereby eliminating delays between modules. However, the practice of replacing original modules with neural networks in a black-box manner diminishes the overall system's robustness and stability. It lacks principled explanations and often fails to consistently generate high-quality motion trajectories. Furthermore, such methods often struggle to rigorously account for the robot's kinematic constraints, resulting in the generation of trajectories that cannot be executed satisfactorily. In this work, we combine the advantages of traditional methods and neural networks by proposing an optimization-embedded neural network. This network can learn high-quality trajectories directly from visual inputs without the need of mapping, while ensuring dynamic feasibility. Here, the deep neural network is employed to directly extract environment safety regions from depth images. Subsequently, we employ a model-based approach to represent these regions as safety constraints in trajectory optimization. Leveraging the availability of highly efficient optimization algorithms, our method robustly converges to feasible and optimal solutions that satisfy various user-defined constraints. Moreover, we differentiate the optimization process, allowing it to be trained as a layer within the neural network. This approach facilitates the direct interaction between perception and planning, enabling the network to focus more on the spatial regions where optimal solutions exist. As a result, it further enhances the quality and stability of the generated trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Some ...</summary><p>Some statements in the introduction may be controversial</p></details> |

Furthermore, we fine-tune LLMs on AgentBank to get a series of agent models, Samoyed.

| **[Reliable Probabilistic Human Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06905v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous systems, like vehicles or robots, require reliable, accurate, fast, resource-efficient, scalable, and low-latency trajectory predictions to get initial knowledge about future locations and movements of surrounding objects for safe human-machine interaction. Furthermore, they need to know the uncertainty of the predictions for risk assessment to provide safe path planning. This paper presents a lightweight method to address these requirements, combining Long Short-Term Memory and Mixture Density Networks. Our method predicts probability distributions, including confidence level estimations for positional uncertainty to support subsequent risk management applications and runs on a low-power embedded platform. We discuss essential requirements for human trajectory prediction in autonomous vehicle applications and demonstrate our method's performance using multiple traffic-related datasets. Furthermore, we explain reliability and sharpness metrics and show how important they are to guarantee the correctness and robustness of a model's predictions and uncertainty assessments. These essential evaluations have so far received little attention for no good reason. Our approach focuses entirely on real-world applicability. Verifying prediction uncertainties and a model's reliability are central to autonomous real-world applications.

| **[Generalized Consistency Trajectory Models for Image Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12510v3)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) excel in unconditional generation, as well as on applications such as image editing and restoration. The success of DMs lies in the iterative nature of diffusion: diffusion breaks down the complex process of mapping noise to data into a sequence of simple denoising tasks. Moreover, we are able to exert fine-grained control over the generation process by injecting guidance terms into each denoising step. However, the iterative process is also computationally intensive, often taking from tens up to thousands of function evaluations. Although consistency trajectory models (CTMs) enable traversal between any time points along the probability flow ODE (PFODE) and score inference with a single function evaluation, CTMs only allow translation from Gaussian noise to data. This work aims to unlock the full potential of CTMs by proposing generalized CTMs (GCTMs), which translate between arbitrary distributions via ODEs. We discuss the design space of GCTMs and demonstrate their efficacy in various image manipulation tasks such as image-to-image translation, restoration, and editing.</p></details> |  |

This work investigates LLMs' ability to estimate probability density functions (PDFs) from data observed in-context; such density estimation (DE) is a fundamental task underlying many probabilistic modeling problems. We leverage the Intensive Principal Component Analysis (InPCA) to visualize and analyze the in-context learning dynamics of LLaMA-2 models. Our main finding is that these LLMs all follow similar learning trajectories in a low-dimensional InPCA space, which are distinct from those of traditional density estimation methods like histograms and Gaussian kernel density estimation (KDE). We interpret the LLaMA in-context DE process as a KDE with an adaptive kernel width and shape. This custom kernel model captures a significant portion of LLaMA's behavior despite having only two parameters. We further speculate on why LLaMA's kernel width and shape differs from classical algorithms, providing insights into the mechanism of in-context probabilistic reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Differentiable collision detection of polytopes is leveraged for optimal collision avoidance. Results obtained from the collocation methods are benchmarked against the existing approaches on an edge computer to outline the performance improvements.

Local trajectory is obtained as a numerical solution of the Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem. Collision avoidance may be provided by adding repulsive potential of the obstacles to the cost function of MPC. We develop an approach, where repulsive potential is estimated by the neural model. We propose and explore three possible strategies of handling dynamic obstacles. First, environment with dynamic obstacles is considered as a sequence of static environments. Second, the neural model predict a sequence of repulsive potential at once. Third, the neural model predict future repulsive potential step by step in autoregressive mode. We implement these strategies and compare it with CIAO* and MPPI using BenchMR framework. First two strategies showed higher performance than CIAO* and MPPI while preserving safety constraints. The third strategy was a bit slower, however it still satisfy time limits.

While prior works mostly rely on human feedback in the form of comparisons, language is a preferable modality that provides more informative insights into user preferences. In this work, we aim to incorporate comparative language feedback to iteratively improve robot trajectories and to learn reward functions that encode human preferences. To achieve this goal, we learn a shared latent space that integrates trajectory data and language feedback, and subsequently leverage the learned latent space to improve trajectories and learn human preferences. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to incorporate comparative language feedback into reward learning. Our simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned latent space and the success of our learning algorithms.

In this paper, we study the problem of computing joint torques and grasping forces for time-optimal motion of an object, while ensuring that the grasp is not lost and any constraints on the motion of the object, either due to dynamics, environment contact, or no-slip requirements, are also satisfied. We present a second-order cone program (SOCP) formulation of the time-optimal trajectory planning problem that considers nonlinear friction cone constraints at the hand-object and object-environment contacts. Since SOCPs are convex optimization problems that can be solved optimally in polynomial time using interior point methods, we can solve the trajectory optimization problem efficiently. We present simulation results on three examples, including a non-prehensile manipulation task, which shows the generality and effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Recent work has shown the potential for LLMs to infer preferences from user interactions, but they often produce broad and generic preferences, failing to capture the unique and individualized nature of human preferences. This paper introduces PREDICT, a method designed to enhance the precision and adaptability of inferring preferences. PREDICT incorporates three key elements: (1) iterative refinement of inferred preferences, (2) decomposition of preferences into constituent components, and (3) validation of preferences across multiple trajectories. We evaluate PREDICT on two distinct environments: a gridworld setting and a new text-domain environment (PLUME).

However, existing trajectory anomaly detection methods are primarily focused on vehicle-level traffic, while human-level trajectory anomaly detection remains under-explored. Since human trajectory data is often very sparse, machine learning methods have become the preferred approach for identifying complex patterns. However, concerns regarding potential biases and the robustness of these models have intensified the demand for more transparent and explainable alternatives. In response to these challenges, our research focuses on developing a lightweight anomaly detection model specifically designed to detect anomalies in human trajectories. We propose a Neural Collaborative Filtering approach to model and predict normal mobility. Our method is designed to model users' daily patterns of life without requiring prior knowledge, thereby enhancing performance in scenarios where data is sparse or incomplete, such as in cold start situations. Our algorithm consists of two main modules. The first is the collaborative filtering module, which applies collaborative filtering to model normal mobility of individual humans to places of interest. The second is the neural module, responsible for interpreting the complex spatio-temporal relationships inherent in human trajectory data. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments using simulated and real-world datasets comparing to numerous state-of-the-art trajectory anomaly detection approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the 1st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Geospatial Anomaly Detection (GeoAnomalies'24)</p></details> |

This paper particularly focuses on generating sequences of images from the photorealistic Gaussian Splatting models, that match instructions that are given by user-inputted language. We contribute a novel framework, SplaTraj, which formulates the generation of images within photorealistic environment representations as a continuous-time trajectory optimization problem. Costs are designed so that a camera following the trajectory poses will smoothly traverse through the environment and render the specified spatial information in a photogenic manner. This is achieved by querying a photorealistic representation with language embedding to isolate regions that correspond to the user-specified inputs. These regions are then projected to the camera's view as it moves over time and a cost is constructed. We can then apply gradient-based optimization and differentiate through the rendering to optimize the trajectory for the defined cost. The resulting trajectory moves to photogenically view each of the specified objects. We empirically evaluate our approach on a suite of environments and instructions, and demonstrate the quality of generated image sequences.</p></details> |  |

To effectively promote cycling, early studies have extensively investigated the relationship between cycling behaviors and environmental factors, especially cyclists' preferences when making route decisions. However, these studies often struggle to comprehensively describe detailed cycling procedures at a large scale due to data limitations, and they tend to overlook the complex nature of cyclists' preferences. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework aimed to quantify and interpret cyclists' complicated visual preferences by leveraging maximum entropy deep inverse reinforcement learning(MEDIRL)and explainable artificial intelligence(XAI). Implemented in Bantian Sub-district, Shenzhen, we adapt MEDIRL model for efficient estimation of cycling reward function by integrating dockless-bike-sharing(DBS) trajectory and street view images(SVIs), which serves as a representation of cyclists' preferences for street visual environments during routing. In addition, we demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of MEDIRL in discovering cyclists' visual preferences. We find that cyclists focus on specific street visual elements when making route decisions, which can be summarized as their attention to safety, street enclosure, and cycling comfort. Further analysis reveals the complex nonlinear effects of street visual elements on cyclists' preferences, offering a cost-effective perspective on streetscapes design. Our proposed framework advances the understanding of individual cycling behaviors and provides actionable insights for urban planners to design bicycle-friendly streetscapes that prioritize cyclists' preferences.</p></details> | 39 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Deterministic Trajectory Optimization through Probabilistic Optimal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13316v2)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article proposes two new algorithms tailored to discrete-time deterministic finite-horizon nonlinear optimal control problems or so-called trajectory optimization problems. Both algorithms are inspired by a novel theoretical paradigm known as probabilistic optimal control, that reformulates optimal control as an equivalent probabilistic inference problem. This perspective allows to address the problem using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. We show that the application of this algorithm results in a fixed point iteration of probabilistic policies that converge to the deterministic optimal policy. Two strategies for policy evaluation are discussed, using state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods resulting into two distinct algorithms. The algorithms are structurally closest related to the differential dynamic programming algorithm and related methods that use sigma-point methods to avoid direct gradient evaluations. The main advantage of our work is an improved balance between exploration and exploitation over the iterations, leading to improved numerical stability and accelerated convergence. These properties are demonstrated on different nonlinear systems.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel trajectory-guided approach, the Patch Intensity Convergence (PIC) technique, which generates high-fidelity bounding boxes for UAV detection without manual labeling. This technique forms the foundation of UAVDB, a dedicated database designed specifically for UAV detection. Unlike datasets that often focus on large UAVs or simple backgrounds, UAVDB utilizes high-resolution RGB video to capture UAVs at various scales, from hundreds of pixels to near-single-digit sizes. This extensive scale variation enables robust evaluation of detection algorithms under diverse conditions. Using the PIC technique, bounding boxes can be efficiently generated from trajectory or position data. We benchmark UAVDB using state-of-the-art (SOTA) YOLO series detectors, providing a comprehensive performance analysis. Our results demonstrate UAVDB's potential as a critical resource for advancing UAV detection, particularly in high-resolution and long-distance tracking scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Despite recent research, planning three-dimensional (3D) UAV trajectories over a continuous temporal-spatial domain remains challenging due to the need to solve computationally intensive optimization problems. In this paper, we study UAV-assisted IoT data collection aimed at minimizing total energy consumption while accounting for the UAV's physical capabilities, the heterogeneous data demands of IoT nodes, and 3D terrain. We propose a matrix-based differential evolution with constraint handling (MDE-CH), a computation-efficient evolutionary algorithm designed to address non-convex constrained optimization problems with several different types of constraints. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed MDE-CH algorithm provides a continuous 3D temporal-spatial UAV trajectory capable of efficiently minimizing energy consumption under various practical constraints and outperforms the conventional fly-hover-fly model for both two-dimensional (2D) and 3D trajectory planning.</p></details> |  |

This capability hinges on solving non-convex optimal control problems in real time, although traditional iterative methods such as sequential convex programming impose significant computational challenges. To mitigate this burden, the Autonomous Rendezvous Transformer introduced a generative model trained to provide near-optimal initial guesses. This approach provides convergence to better local optima (e.g., fuel optimality), improves feasibility rates, and results in faster convergence speed of optimization algorithms through warm-starting. This work extends the capabilities of ART to address robust chance-constrained optimal control problems. Specifically, ART is applied to challenging rendezvous scenarios in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), ensuring fault-tolerant behavior under uncertainty. Through extensive experimentation, the proposed warm-starting strategy is shown to consistently produce high-quality reference trajectories, achieving up to 30% cost improvement and 50% reduction in infeasible cases compared to conventional methods, demonstrating robust performance across multiple state representations. Additionally, a post hoc evaluation framework is proposed to assess the quality of generated trajectories and mitigate runtime failures, marking an initial step toward the reliable deployment of AI-driven solutions in safety-critical autonomous systems such as spacecraft.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the IEEE Aerospace Conference 2025. 13 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

This necessitates advanced interactive multi-agent motion planning techniques. Generalized Nash equilibrium(GNE), a solution concept in constrained game theory, provides a mathematical model to predict the outcome of interactive motion planning, where each agent needs to account for other agents in the environment. However, in practice, multiple local GNEs may exist. Finding a single GNE itself is complex as it requires solving coupled constrained optimal control problems. Furthermore, finding all such local GNEs requires exploring the solution space of GNEs, which is a challenging task. This work proposes the MultiNash-PF framework to efficiently compute multiple local GNEs in constrained trajectory games. Potential games are a class of games for which a local GNE of a trajectory game can be found by solving a single constrained optimal control problem. We propose MultiNash-PF that integrates the potential game approach with implicit particle filtering, a sample-efficient method for non-convex trajectory optimization. We first formulate the underlying game as a constrained potential game and then utilize the implicit particle filtering to identify the coarse estimates of multiple local minimizers of the game's potential function. MultiNash-PF then refines these estimates with optimization solvers, obtaining different local GNEs. We show through numerical simulations that MultiNash-PF reduces computation time by up to 50\% compared to a baseline approach.</p></details> |  |

Here, we extend by a significant step this proposal. Instead of using the explicit knowledge of the underlying equations of motion, we develop the method directly from system trajectories. This is crucial towards enhancing the practical implementation of the method in scenarios where solely data reflecting discrete snapshots of the system are available. We showcase the results of the method and the number of associated conservation laws obtained in a diverse range of examples including 1D and 2D harmonic oscillators, the Toda lattice, the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou lattice and the Calogero-Moser system.</p></details> |  |

We adopt a holistic approach that focuses on uncertainty quantification, decomposition, and the influence of model composition. Our method is based on a theoretically grounded information-theoretic approach to measure uncertainty, allowing us to decompose total uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic components.

In this paper, we reformulate the trajectory optimization of this kind of method, focusing on enhancing both reconstruction quality and efficiency. Initially, we navigate effective restoration paths through a reinforcement learning process, gradually steering potential trajectories toward the most precise options. Additionally, to mitigate the considerable computational burden associated with iterative sampling, we propose cost-aware trajectory distillation to streamline complex paths into several manageable steps with adaptable sizes. Moreover, we fine-tune a foundational diffusion model (FLUX) with 12B parameters by using our algorithms, producing a unified framework for handling 7 kinds of image restoration tasks. Extensive experiments showcase the significant superiority of the proposed method, achieving a maximum PSNR improvement of 2.1 dB over state-of-the-art methods, while also greatly enhancing visual perceptual quality.

Specifically, the treble-functional UAVs are capable of offering communication and edge computing services to mobile users (MUs) in proximity, alongside their target sensing capabilities by using multi-input multi-output arrays. For the purpose of enhance the computation efficiency, we consider task compression, where each MU can partially compress their offloaded data prior to transmission to trim its size. The objective is to minimize the weighted energy consumption by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming, the UAVs' trajectories, the compression and offloading partition, the computation resource allocation, while fulfilling the causal-effect correlation between communication and computation as well as adhering to the constraints on sensing quality. To tackle it, we first reformulate the original problem as a multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP), which involves heterogeneous agents to decompose the large state spaces and action spaces of MDP. Then, we propose a multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm with attention mechanism to handle the decision-making problem. Simulation results validate the significant effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing energy consumption. Moreover, it demonstrates superior performance compared to the baselines in relation to resource utilization and convergence speed.</p></details> | 15 pages, 13 figures |

The proposed trajectory is constructed by the concatenation of three circular arcs of varying radii. Such a trajectory guarantees a complete coverage of the maximum set of reachable lengths while minimising the number of changeover points in the trajectory to a maximum of two under all scenarios. Additionally, by using the notion of internally tangent circles, we expand the set of Circle-Circle-Circle trajectories to eight kinds, consisting of {LLL, LLR, LRR, LRL, RRL, RLL, RLR, RRR} paths. The paper presents a mathematical formulation of the proposed trajectory and the conditions for the existence and classification of each kind of trajectory. We also analyse the variation of the length of the trajectory using suitable elongation strategies and derive the set of reachable lengths for all pairs of oriented points.

| **[TR-LLM: Integrating Trajectory Data for Scene-Aware LLM-Based Human Action Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03993v1)** | 2024-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of human behavior is crucial for AI systems to effectively support real-world applications, such as autonomous robots anticipating and assisting with human tasks. Real-world scenarios frequently present challenges such as occlusions and incomplete scene observations, which can compromise predictive accuracy. Thus, traditional video-based methods often struggle due to limited temporal and spatial perspectives. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative. Having been trained on a large text corpus describing human behaviors, LLMs likely encode plausible sequences of human actions in a home environment. However, LLMs, trained primarily on text data, lack inherent spatial awareness and real-time environmental perception. They struggle with understanding physical constraints and spatial geometry. Therefore, to be effective in a real-world spatial scenario, we propose a multimodal prediction framework that enhances LLM-based action prediction by integrating physical constraints derived from human trajectories. Our experiments demonstrate that combining LLM predictions with trajectory data significantly improves overall prediction performance. This enhancement is particularly notable in situations where the LLM receives limited scene information, highlighting the complementary nature of linguistic knowledge and physical constraints in understanding and anticipating human behavior.</p></details> |  |

This approach is the first of its kind to be applied to spatiotemporal data. By embedding $2+1$-dimensional spatiotemporal data into $\mathbb{R}^3$, we utilize persistent homology to detect loops within the trajectories in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Our research reveals that, under normal conditions, trajectory data embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ over time do not form loops. Consequently, we can effectively identify anomalies characterized by the presence of loops within the trajectories. This method is robust and capable of detecting loops that are invariant to small perturbations, variations in geometric shape, and local coordinate projections. Additionally, our approach provides a novel perspective on anomaly detection, offering enhanced sensitivity and specificity in identifying atypical patterns in geospatial data. This approach has significant implications for various applications, including maritime navigation, environmental monitoring, and surveillance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Title...</summary><p>Title: Identification of Anomalous Geospatial Trajectories via Persistent Homology Authors: Kyle Evans-Lee, Kevin Lamb Comments: 18 pages, 12 figures We present a method for analyzing geospatial trajectory data using topological data analysis (TDA) to identify a specific class of anomalies, commonly referred to as crop circles, in AIS data</p></details> |
| **[DOTS: Learning to Reason Dynamically in LLMs via Optimal Reasoning Trajectories Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03864v1)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the capability of large language models (LLMs) in reasoning has gained significant attention in recent years. Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of various prompting strategies in aiding LLMs in reasoning (called "reasoning actions"), such as step-by-step thinking, reflecting before answering, solving with programs, and their combinations. However, these approaches often applied static, predefined reasoning actions uniformly to all questions, without considering the specific characteristics of each question or the capability of the task-solving LLM. In this paper, we propose DOTS, an approach enabling LLMs to reason dynamically via optimal reasoning trajectory search, tailored to the specific characteristics of each question and the inherent capability of the task-solving LLM. Our approach involves three key steps: i) defining atomic reasoning action modules that can be composed into various reasoning action trajectories; ii) searching for the optimal action trajectory for each training question through iterative exploration and evaluation for the specific task-solving LLM; and iii) using the collected optimal trajectories to train an LLM to plan for the reasoning trajectories of unseen questions. In particular, we propose two learning paradigms, i.e., fine-tuning an external LLM as a planner to guide the task-solving LLM, or directly fine-tuning the task-solving LLM with an internalized capability for reasoning actions planning. Our experiments across eight reasoning tasks show that our method consistently outperforms static reasoning techniques and the vanilla instruction tuning approach. Further analysis reveals that our method enables LLMs to adjust their computation based on problem complexity, allocating deeper thinking and reasoning to harder problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topology-Driven Parallel Trajectory Optimization in Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06021v2)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ground robots navigating in complex, dynamic environments must compute collision-free trajectories to avoid obstacles safely and efficiently. Nonconvex optimization is a popular method to compute a trajectory in real-time. However, these methods often converge to locally optimal solutions and frequently switch between different local minima, leading to inefficient and unsafe robot motion. In this work, We propose a novel topology-driven trajectory optimization strategy for dynamic environments that plans multiple distinct evasive trajectories to enhance the robot's behavior and efficiency. A global planner iteratively generates trajectories in distinct homotopy classes. These trajectories are then optimized by local planners working in parallel. While each planner shares the same navigation objectives, they are locally constrained to a specific homotopy class, meaning each local planner attempts a different evasive maneuver. The robot then executes the feasible trajectory with the lowest cost in a receding horizon manner. We demonstrate, on a mobile robot navigating among pedestrians, that our approach leads to faster and safer trajectories than existing planners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |

However, the application of B-spline curves for path-velocity coupled trajectory planning in autonomous vehicles (AVs) has been highly limited because it is challenging to reduce the over-approximation of the vehicle shape and to create a collision-free trajectory using B-spline curves while satisfying kinodynamic constraints. To address these challenges, this paper proposes novel disc-type swept volume (SV), incremental path flattening (IPF), and kinodynamic feasibility penalty methods. The disc-type SV estimation method is a new technique to reduce SV over-approximation and is used to find collision points for IPF. In IPF, the collision points are used to push the trajectory away from obstacles and to iteratively increase the curvature weight, thereby reducing SV and generating a collision-free trajectory. Additionally, to satisfy kinodynamic constraints for AVs using B-spline curves, we apply a clamped B-spline curvature penalty along with longitudinal and lateral velocity and acceleration penalties. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various simulated environments. We also conducted a real-world experiment using an AV, and our results validate the simulated tracking performance of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 21 figures, 5 tables, 3 algorithms</p></details> |
| **[Learning a Fast Mixing Exogenous Block MDP using a Single Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03016v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In order to train agents that can quickly adapt to new objectives or reward functions, efficient unsupervised representation learning in sequential decision-making environments can be important. Frameworks such as the Exogenous Block Markov Decision Process (Ex-BMDP) have been proposed to formalize this representation-learning problem (Efroni et al., 2022b). In the Ex-BMDP framework, the agent's high-dimensional observations of the environment have two latent factors: a controllable factor, which evolves deterministically within a small state space according to the agent's actions, and an exogenous factor, which represents time-correlated noise, and can be highly complex. The goal of the representation learning problem is to learn an encoder that maps from observations into the controllable latent space, as well as the dynamics of this space. Efroni et al. (2022b) has shown that this is possible with a sample complexity that depends only on the size of the controllable latent space, and not on the size of the noise factor. However, this prior work has focused on the episodic setting, where the controllable latent state resets to a specific start state after a finite horizon. By contrast, if the agent can only interact with the environment in a single continuous trajectory, prior works have not established sample-complexity bounds. We propose STEEL, the first provably sample-efficient algorithm for learning the controllable dynamics of an Ex-BMDP from a single trajectory, in the function approximation setting. STEEL has a sample complexity that depends only on the sizes of the controllable latent space and the encoder function class, and (at worst linearly) on the mixing time of the exogenous noise factor. We prove that STEEL is correct and sample-efficient, and demonstrate STEEL on two toy problems. Code is available at: https://github.com/midi-lab/steel.</p></details> |  |

The challenge arises from the non-convex nature of the optimization problem with multiple local optima, which usually requires a global search. Traditional numerical solvers struggle to find diverse solutions efficiently without appropriate initial guesses. In this paper, we introduce DiffuSolve, a general diffusion model-based solver for non-convex trajectory optimization. An expressive diffusion model is trained on pre-collected locally optimal solutions and efficiently samples initial guesses, which then warm-starts numerical solvers to fine-tune the feasibility and optimality. We also present DiffuSolve+, a novel constrained diffusion model with an additional loss in training that further reduces the problem constraint violations of diffusion samples. Experimental evaluations on three tasks verify the improved robustness, diversity, and a 2$\times$ to 11$\times$ increase in computational efficiency with our proposed method, which generalizes well to trajectory optimization problems of varying challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization with Global Yaw Parameterization for Field-of-View Constrained Autonomous Flight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17067v2)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory generation for quadrotors with limited field-of-view sensors has numerous applications such as aerial exploration, coverage, inspection, videography, and target tracking. Most previous works simplify the task of optimizing yaw trajectories by either aligning the heading of the robot with its velocity, or potentially restricting the feasible space of candidate trajectories by using a limited yaw domain to circumvent angular singularities. In this paper, we propose a novel \textit{global} yaw parameterization method for trajectory optimization that allows a 360-degree yaw variation as demanded by the underlying algorithm. This approach effectively bypasses inherent singularities by including supplementary quadratic constraints and transforming the final decision variables into the desired state representation. This method significantly reduces the needed control effort, and improves optimization feasibility. Furthermore, we apply the method to several examples of different applications that require jointly optimizing over both the yaw and position trajectories. Ultimately, we present a comprehensive numerical analysis and evaluation of our proposed method in both simulation and real-world experiments.</p></details> |  |

The number of features is comparable to the sample size and errors may be heavy-tailed. We introduce estimators that precisely track the generalization error of the iterates along the trajectory of the iterative algorithm. These estimators are provably consistent under suitable conditions. The results are illustrated through several examples, including Huber regression, pseudo-Huber regression, and their penalized variants with non-smooth regularizer. We provide explicit generalization error estimates for iterates generated from GD and SGD, or from proximal SGD in the presence of a non-smooth regularizer. The proposed risk estimates serve as effective proxies for the actual generalization error, allowing us to determine the optimal stopping iteration that minimizes the generalization error. Extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed generalization error estimates.</p></details> |  |

Although most existing methods concentrate on learning continuous representations to gain valuable experience, they often suffer from computational inefficiencies and struggle with unfamiliar situations. To address this issue, we propose the Fragmented-Memory-based Trajectory Prediction (FMTP) model, inspired by the remarkable learning capabilities of humans, particularly their ability to leverage accumulated experience and recall relevant memories in unfamiliar situations. The FMTP model employs discrete representations to enhance computational efficiency by reducing information redundancy while maintaining the flexibility to utilize past experiences. Specifically, we design a learnable memory array by consolidating continuous trajectory representations from the training set using defined quantization operations during the training phase. This approach further eliminates redundant information while preserving essential features in discrete form. Additionally, we develop an advanced reasoning engine based on language models to deeply learn the associative rules among these discrete representations. Our method has been evaluated on various public datasets, including ETH-UCY, inD, SDD, nuScenes, Waymo, and VTL-TP. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significant performance and extracts more valuable experience from past trajectories to inform the current state.</p></details> |  |

This poses challenges for classical time-series models that require equally spaced data. To address this, we propose a novel time-series Transformer called Trajectory Generative Pre-trained Transformer (TrajGPT). TrajGPT employs a novel Selective Recurrent Attention (SRA) mechanism, which utilizes a data-dependent decay to adaptively filter out irrelevant past information based on contexts. By interpreting TrajGPT as discretized ordinary differential equations (ODEs), it effectively captures the underlying continuous dynamics and enables time-specific inference for forecasting arbitrary target timesteps. Experimental results demonstrate that TrajGPT excels in trajectory forecasting, drug usage prediction, and phenotype classification without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. By evolving the learned continuous dynamics, TrajGPT can interpolate and extrapolate disease risk trajectories from partially-observed time series. The visualization of predicted health trajectories shows that TrajGPT forecasts unseen diseases based on the history of clinically relevant phenotypes (i.e., contexts).</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Equality Constrained Diffusion for Direct Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01939v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent success of diffusion-based generative models in image and natural language processing has ignited interest in diffusion-based trajectory optimization for nonlinear control systems. Existing methods cannot, however, handle the nonlinear equality constraints necessary for direct trajectory optimization. As a result, diffusion-based trajectory optimizers are currently limited to shooting methods, where the nonlinear dynamics are enforced by forward rollouts. This precludes many of the benefits enjoyed by direct methods, including flexible state constraints, reduced numerical sensitivity, and easy initial guess specification. In this paper, we present a method for diffusion-based optimization with equality constraints. This allows us to perform direct trajectory optimization, enforcing dynamic feasibility with constraints rather than rollouts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first diffusion-based optimization algorithm that supports the general nonlinear equality constraints required for direct trajectory optimization.</p></details> |  |

Recently, C-ADMM has been studied in robotics applications such as multi-vehicle target tracking and collaborative manipulation tasks. However, few works have investigated the performance of C-ADMM applied to non-convex problems in robotics applications due to a lack of theoretical guarantees. For this project, we aim to quantitatively explore and examine the convergence behavior of non-convex C-ADMM through the scope of distributed multi-robot trajectory planning. We propose a convex trajectory planning problem by leveraging C-ADMM and Buffered Voronoi Cells (BVCs) to get around the non-convex collision avoidance constraint and compare this convex C-ADMM algorithm to a non-convex C-ADMM baseline with non-convex collision avoidance constraints. We show that the convex C-ADMM algorithm requires 1000 fewer iterations to achieve convergence in a multi-robot waypoint navigation scenario. We also confirm that the non-convex C-ADMM baseline leads to sub-optimal solutions and violation of safety constraints in trajectory generation.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we address the problem of one-shot imitation from a single human demonstration, given by an RGB-D video recording. We propose a two-stage process. In the first stage we extract the demonstration trajectory offline. This entails segmenting manipulated objects and determining their relative motion in relation to secondary objects such as containers. In the online trajectory generation stage, we first re-detect all objects, then warp the demonstration trajectory to the current scene and execute it on the robot. To complete these steps, our method leverages several ancillary models, including those for segmentation, relative object pose estimation, and grasp prediction. We systematically evaluate different combinations of correspondence and re-detection methods to validate our design decision across a diverse range of tasks. Specifically, we collect and quantitatively test on demonstrations of ten different tasks including pick-and-place tasks as well as articulated object manipulation. Finally, we perform extensive evaluations on a real robot system to demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of our approach in real-world scenarios. We make the code publicly available at http://ditto.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, accepted at IROS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Contact-Implicit Model Predictive Control: Controlling Diverse Quadruped Motions Without Pre-Planned Contact Modes or Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08961v2)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a contact-implicit model predictive control (MPC) framework for the real-time discovery of multi-contact motions, without predefined contact mode sequences or foothold positions. This approach utilizes the contact-implicit differential dynamic programming (DDP) framework, merging the hard contact model with a linear complementarity constraint. We propose the analytical gradient of the contact impulse based on relaxed complementarity constraints to further the exploration of a variety of contact modes. By leveraging a hard contact model-based simulation and computation of search direction through a smooth gradient, our methodology identifies dynamically feasible state trajectories, control inputs, and contact forces while simultaneously unveiling new contact mode sequences. However, the broadened scope of contact modes does not always ensure real-world applicability. Recognizing this, we implemented differentiable cost terms to guide foot trajectories and make gait patterns. Furthermore, to address the challenge of unstable initial roll-outs in an MPC setting, we employ the multiple shooting variant of DDP. The efficacy of the proposed framework is validated through simulations and real-world demonstrations using a 45 kg HOUND quadruped robot, performing various tasks in simulation and showcasing actual experiments involving a forward trot and a front-leg rearing motion.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the accepted version for The International Journal of Robotics Research (2024); published version at https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02783649241273645 / Videos at https://youtu.be/SXD4BJIfyoY</p></details> |
| **[Demystifying Trajectory Recovery From Ash: An Open-Source Evaluation and Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14645v2)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Once analysed, location trajectories can provide valuable insights beneficial to various applications. However, such data is also highly sensitive, rendering them susceptible to privacy risks in the event of mismanagement, for example, revealing an individual's identity, home address, or political affiliations. Hence, ensuring that privacy is preserved for this data is a priority. One commonly taken measure to mitigate this concern is aggregation. Previous work by Xu et al. shows that trajectories are still recoverable from anonymised and aggregated datasets. However, the study lacks implementation details, obfuscating the mechanisms of the attack. Additionally, the attack was evaluated on commercial non-public datasets, rendering the results and subsequent claims unverifiable. This study reimplements the trajectory recovery attack from scratch and evaluates it on two open-source datasets, detailing the preprocessing steps and implementation. Results confirm that privacy leakage still exists despite common anonymisation and aggregation methods but also indicate that the initial accuracy claims may have been overly ambitious. We release all code as open-source to ensure the results are entirely reproducible and, therefore, verifiable. Moreover, we propose a stronger attack by designing a series of enhancements to the baseline attack. These enhancements yield higher accuracies by up to 16%, providing an improved benchmark for future research in trajectory recovery methods. Our improvements also enable online execution of the attack, allowing partial attacks on larger datasets previously considered unprocessable, thereby furthering the extent of privacy leakage. The findings emphasise the importance of using strong privacy-preserving mechanisms when releasing aggregated mobility data and not solely relying on aggregation as a means of anonymisation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 17th International Conference on Security of Information and Networks (SIN'24).

These low-thrust missions, typically characterized by long thrust arcs, are highly susceptible to operational disruptions such as unforeseen thruster outages or missed thrust events. Consequently, there is a critical need for efficient trajectory design frameworks which incorporate robustness against such anomalies. In this study, we utilize a robust trajectory design framework to explore the solution space for the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) module to the Earth-Moon L2 Southern 9:2 Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit. We propose algorithmic enhancements to improve the global search for robust solutions, and present a comprehensive analysis of two approaches: a nonconditional approach which involves a purely random search for robust solutions versus a conditional approach which involves warm-starting the search for robust solutions using the non-robust solutions. Our results indicate that by using non-robust solutions as initial guesses for the robust solutions, it is possible to achieve significant improvements in both the rate of convergence and the robustness of the final solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript was submitted to Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics.

| **[A Historical Trajectory Assisted Optimization Method for Zeroth-Order Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15955v3)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning heavily relies on distributed gradient descent techniques. In the situation where gradient information is not available, the gradients need to be estimated from zeroth-order information, which typically involves computing finite-differences along isotropic random directions. This method suffers from high estimation errors, as the geometric features of the objective landscape may be overlooked during the isotropic sampling. In this work, we propose a non-isotropic sampling method to improve the gradient estimation procedure. Gradients in our method are estimated in a subspace spanned by historical trajectories of solutions, aiming to encourage the exploration of promising regions and hence improve the convergence. The proposed method uses a covariance matrix for sampling which is a convex combination of two parts. The first part is a thin projection matrix containing the basis of the subspace which is designed to improve the exploitation ability. The second part is the historical trajectories. We implement this method in zeroth-order federated settings, and show that the convergence rate aligns with existing ones while introducing no significant overheads in communication or local computation. The effectiveness of our proposal is verified on several numerical experiments in comparison to several commonly-used zeroth-order federated optimization algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages with theoretical proof</p></details> |
| **[CVVLSNet: Vehicle Location and Speed Estimation Using Partial Connected Vehicle Trajectory Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00132v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time estimation of vehicle locations and speeds is crucial for developing many beneficial transportation applications in traffic management and control, e.g., adaptive signal control. Recent advances in communication technologies facilitate the emergence of connected vehicles (CVs), which can share traffic information with nearby CVs or infrastructures. At the early stage of connectivity, only a portion of vehicles are CVs. The locations and speeds for those non-CVs (NCs) are not accessible and must be estimated to obtain the full traffic information. To address the above problem, this paper proposes a novel CV-based Vehicle Location and Speed estimation network, CVVLSNet, to simultaneously estimate the vehicle locations and speeds exclusively using partial CV trajectory data. A road cell occupancy (RCO) method is first proposed to represent the variable vehicle state information. Spatiotemporal interactions can be integrated by simply fusing the RCO representations. Then, CVVLSNet, taking the Coding-RAte TransformEr (CRATE) network as a backbone, is introduced to estimate the vehicle locations and speeds. Moreover, physical vehicle size constraints are also considered in loss functions. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed method significantly outperformed the existing method under various CV penetration rates, signal timings, and volume-to-capacity ratios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Opt2Skill: Imitating Dynamically-feasible Whole-Body Trajectories for Versatile Humanoid Loco-Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20514v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid robots are designed to perform diverse loco-manipulation tasks. However, they face challenges due to their high-dimensional and unstable dynamics, as well as the complex contact-rich nature of the tasks. Model-based optimal control methods offer precise and systematic control but are limited by high computational complexity and accurate contact sensing. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) provides robustness and handles high-dimensional spaces but suffers from inefficient learning, unnatural motion, and sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Opt2Skill, an end-to-end pipeline that combines model-based trajectory optimization with RL to achieve robust whole-body loco-manipulation. We generate reference motions for the Digit humanoid robot using differential dynamic programming (DDP) and train RL policies to track these trajectories. Our results demonstrate that Opt2Skill outperforms pure RL methods in both training efficiency and task performance, with optimal trajectories that account for torque limits enhancing trajectory tracking. We successfully transfer our approach to real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[HEADS-UP: Head-Mounted Egocentric Dataset for Trajectory Prediction in Blind Assistance Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20324v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce HEADS-UP, the first egocentric dataset collected from head-mounted cameras, designed specifically for trajectory prediction in blind assistance systems. With the growing population of blind and visually impaired individuals, the need for intelligent assistive tools that provide real-time warnings about potential collisions with dynamic obstacles is becoming critical. These systems rely on algorithms capable of predicting the trajectories of moving objects, such as pedestrians, to issue timely hazard alerts. However, existing datasets fail to capture the necessary information from the perspective of a blind individual. To address this gap, HEADS-UP offers a novel dataset focused on trajectory prediction in this context. Leveraging this dataset, we propose a semi-local trajectory prediction approach to assess collision risks between blind individuals and pedestrians in dynamic environments. Unlike conventional methods that separately predict the trajectories of both the blind individual (ego agent) and pedestrians, our approach operates within a semi-local coordinate system, a rotated version of the camera's coordinate system, facilitating the prediction process. We validate our method on the HEADS-UP dataset and implement the proposed solution in ROS, performing real-time tests on an NVIDIA Jetson GPU through a user study. Results from both dataset evaluations and live tests demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our approach.</p></details> |  |

In the Violina framework, we optimize the coefficient matrices of state-space model and memory kernel in the given space using a projected gradient descent method so that its model prediction matches the set of multiple observed data. Using Violina we can identify a linear non-Markovian dynamical system with constraints corresponding to a priori knowledge on the model parameters and memory effects. Using synthetic data, we numerically demonstrate that the Markovian and non-Markovian state-space models identified by the proposed method have considerably better generalization performances compared to the models identified by an existing dynamic decomposition-based method.</p></details> |  |
| **[ICAL: Continual Learning of Multimodal Agents by Transforming Trajectories into Actionable Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14596v2)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale generative language and vision-language models (LLMs and VLMs) excel in few-shot in-context learning for decision making and instruction following. However, they require high-quality exemplar demonstrations to be included in their context window. In this work, we ask: Can LLMs and VLMs generate their own prompt examples from generic, sub-optimal demonstrations? We propose In-Context Abstraction Learning (ICAL), a method that builds a memory of multimodal experience insights from sub-optimal demonstrations and human feedback. Given a noisy demonstration in a new domain, VLMs abstract the trajectory into a general program by fixing inefficient actions and annotating cognitive abstractions: task relationships, object state changes, temporal subgoals, and task construals. These abstractions are refined and adapted interactively through human feedback while the agent attempts to execute the trajectory in a similar environment. The resulting abstractions, when used as exemplars in the prompt, significantly improve decision-making in retrieval-augmented LLM and VLM agents. Our ICAL agent surpasses the state-of-the-art in dialogue-based instruction following in TEACh, multimodal web agents in VisualWebArena, and action anticipation in Ego4D. In TEACh, we achieve a 12.6% improvement in goal-condition success. In VisualWebArena, our task success rate improves over the SOTA from 18.9% to 23.4%. In Ego4D action forecasting, we improve over few-shot GPT-4V and remain competitive with supervised models. We show finetuning our retrieval-augmented in-context agent yields additional improvements. Our approach significantly reduces reliance on expert-crafted examples and consistently outperforms in-context learning from action plans that lack such insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: http://ical-learning.github.io/</p></details> |

Human behavior typically follows a pattern of normalcy in day-to-day activities. This is marked by recurring activities within specific time periods. In this paper, we model this behavior using Reeb graphs where any deviation from usual day-to-day activities is encoded as nodes in the Reeb graph. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear with respect to the number of time points in a given trajectory. We demonstrate the usage of ReeSPOT and how it captures the critically significant spatial and temporal deviations using the nodes of the Reeb graph. Our case study presented in this paper includes realistic human movement scenarios: visiting uncommon locations, taking odd routes at infrequent times, uncommon time visits, and uncommon stay durations. We analyze the Reeb graph to interpret the topological structure of the GPS trajectories. Potential applications of ReeSPOT include urban planning, security surveillance, and behavioral research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Trajectory Replanning for Mars Ascent Vehicle under Propulsion System Faults: A Suboptimal Learning-Based Warm-Start Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19536v1)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>During the Mars ascent vehicle (MAV) launch missions, when encountering a thrust drop type of propulsion system fault problem, the general trajectory replanning methods relying on step-by-step judgments may fail to make timely decisions, potentially leading to mission failure. This paper proposes a suboptimal joint trajectory replanning (SJTR) method, which formulates the joint optimization problem of target orbit and flight trajectory after a fault within a convex optimization framework. By incorporating penalty coefficients for terminal constraints, the optimization solution adheres to the orbit redecision principle, thereby avoiding complex decision-making processes and resulting in a concise and rapid solution to the replanning problem. A learning-based warm-start scheme is proposed in conjunction with the designed SJTR method. Offline, a deep neural network (DNN) is trained using a dataset generated by the SJTR method. Online, the DNN provides initial guesses for the time optimization variables based on the current fault situation, enhancing the solving efficiency and reliability of the algorithm. Numerical simulations of the MAV flight scenario under the thrust drop faults are performed, and Monte Carlo experiments and case studies across all orbit types demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Previous works demonstrated that achieving a truly time-optimal trajectory is computationally too demanding to enable frequent replanning during agile flight, especially on less powerful flight computers. Our approach overcomes this stumbling block by utilizing a point-mass model with a novel iterative thrust decomposition algorithm, enabling the UAV to use all of its collective thrust, something previous point-mass approaches could not achieve. The approach enables gravity and drag modeling integration, significantly reducing tracking errors in high-speed trajectories, which is proven through an ablation study. When combined with a new multi-waypoint optimization algorithm, which uses a gradient-based method to converge to optimal velocities in waypoints, the proposed method generates minimum-time multi-waypoint trajectories within milliseconds. The proposed approach, which we provide as open-source package, is validated both in simulation and in real-world, using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control. With accelerations of up to 3.5g and speeds over 100 km/h, trajectories generated by the proposed method yield similar or even smaller tracking errors than the trajectories generated for a full multirotor model.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods have attempted to mitigate this problem by employing traditional LSTM architectures, but these approaches often suffer from inefficiencies in processing large datasets. In response to this challenge, we propose VecLSTM, a novel framework that enhances the performance and efficiency of LSTM-based neural networks. Unlike conventional approaches, VecLSTM incorporates vectorization layers, leveraging optimized mathematical operations to process input sequences more efficiently. We have implemented VecLSTM and incorporated it into the MySQL database. To evaluate the effectiveness of VecLSTM, we compare its performance against a conventional LSTM model using a dataset comprising 1,467,652 samples with seven unique labels. Experimental results demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art, with VecLSTM achieving a validation accuracy of 85.57\%, a test accuracy of 85.47\%, and a weighted F1-score of 0.86. Furthermore, VecLSTM significantly reduces training time, offering a 26.2\% reduction compared to traditional LSTM models.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

Thus, the focus of existing research has been on where a user goes. On the other hand, the study of how a user moves between locations has great potential for new research opportunities. Kinematic features describe how an individual moves between locations and can be used for tasks such as identification of individuals or anomaly detection. Unfortunately, data availability and quality challenges make kinematic trajectory mining difficult. In this paper, we leverage the Geolife dataset of human trajectories to investigate the viability of using kinematic features to identify individuals and detect anomalies. We show that humans have an individual "kinematic profile" which can be used as a strong signal to identify individual humans. We experimentally show that, for the two use-cases of individual identification and anomaly detection, simple kinematic features fed to standard classification and anomaly detection algorithms significantly improve results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Trajectory Optimization Framework for Differential Drive Robot Class](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07924v2)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential drive robots are widely used in various scenarios thanks to their straightforward principle, from household service robots to disaster response field robots. There are several types of driving mechanisms for real-world applications, including two-wheeled, four-wheeled skid-steering, tracked robots, and so on. The differences in the driving mechanisms usually require specific kinematic modeling when precise control is desired. Furthermore, the nonholonomic dynamics and possible lateral slip lead to different degrees of difficulty in getting feasible and high-quality trajectories. Therefore, a comprehensive trajectory optimization framework to compute trajectories efficiently for various kinds of differential drive robots is highly desirable. In this paper, we propose a universal trajectory optimization framework that can be applied to differential drive robots, enabling the generation of high-quality trajectories within a restricted computational timeframe. We introduce a novel trajectory representation based on polynomial parameterization of motion states or their integrals, such as angular and linear velocities, which inherently matches the robots' motion to the control principle. The trajectory optimization problem is formulated to minimize complexity while prioritizing safety and operational efficiency. We then build a full-stack autonomous planning and control system to demonstrate its feasibility and robustness. We conduct extensive simulations and real-world testing in crowded environments with three kinds of differential drive robots to validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 15 pages, 15 figures |

Methods for trajectory classification are particularly important to detect different movement patterns, while methods for regression to compute motility metrics and forecasting. Recent advances in computer vision have facilitated the processing of trajectories rendered as images via artificial neural networks with 2d convolutional layers (CNNs). This approach leverages the capability of CNNs to learn spatial hierarchies of features from images, necessary to recognize complex shapes. Moreover, it overcomes the limitation of other machine learning methods that require input trajectories with a fixed number of points. However, rendering trajectories as images can introduce poorly investigated artifacts such as information loss due to the plotting of coordinates on a discrete grid, and spectral changes due to line thickness and aliasing. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of CNNs for solving classification and regression problems from synthetic trajectories that have been rendered as images using different modalities. The parameters considered in this study include line thickness, image resolution, usage of motion history (color-coding of the temporal component) and anti-aliasing. Results highlight the importance of choosing an appropriate image resolution according to model depth and motion history in applications where movement direction is critical.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

With the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, there has been growing interest in integrating LLMs for graph learning. However, applying LLMs to graph-related tasks poses significant challenges, as these models are not inherently designed to capture the complex structural information present in graphs. Existing approaches address this challenge through two strategies: the chain of tasks approach, which uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to encode the graph structure so that LLMs are relieved from understanding spatial positions; and Graph-to-Text Conversion, which translates graph structures into semantic text representations that LLMs can process. Despite their progress, these methods often struggle to fully preserve the topological information of graphs or require extensive computational resources, limiting their practical applicability. In this work, we introduce Node Tokenizer for Large Language Models (NT-LLM), a novel framework that efficiently encodes graph structures by selecting key nodes as anchors and representing each node based on its relative distance to these anchors. This position-anchored encoding effectively captures the graph topology, enabling enhanced reasoning capabilities in LLMs over graph data. Additionally, we implement a task-specific tuning procedure to further improve structural understanding within LLMs. Through extensive empirical evaluations, NT-LLM demonstrates significant performance improvements across a variety of graph-related tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Embedding Self-Correction as an Inherent Ability in Large Language Models for Enhanced Mathematical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10735v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate mathematical reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial in revolutionizing domains that heavily rely on such reasoning. However, LLMs often encounter difficulties in certain aspects of mathematical reasoning, leading to flawed reasoning and erroneous results. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a novel mechanism, the Chain of Self-Correction (CoSC), specifically designed to embed self-correction as an inherent ability in LLMs, enabling them to validate and rectify their own results. The CoSC mechanism operates through a sequence of self-correction stages. In each stage, the LLMs generate a program to address a given problem, execute this program using program-based tools to obtain an output, subsequently verify this output. Based on the verification, the LLMs either proceed to the next correction stage or finalize the answer. This iterative self-correction process allows the LLMs to refine their reasoning steps and improve the accuracy of their mathematical reasoning. To enable the CoSC mechanism at a low cost, we employ a two-phase finetuning approach. In the first phase, the LLMs are trained with a relatively small volume of seeding data generated from GPT-4, establishing an initial CoSC capability. In the second phase, the CoSC capability is further enhanced by training with a larger volume of self-generated data using the trained model in the first phase, without relying on the paid GPT-4. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CoSC significantly improves performance on traditional mathematical datasets among existing open-source LLMs. Notably, our CoSC-Code-34B model achieved a 53.5% score on MATH, the most challenging mathematical reasoning dataset in the public domain, surpassing the performance of well-established models such as ChatGPT, GPT-4, and even multi-modal LLMs like GPT-4V, Gemini-1.0 Pro, and Gemini-1.0 Ultra.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models Are Active Critics in NLG Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10724v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The conventional paradigm of using large language models (LLMs) for evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems typically relies on two key inputs: (1) a clear definition of the NLG task to be evaluated and (2) a list of pre-defined evaluation criteria. This process treats LLMs as ''passive critics,'' strictly following human-defined criteria for evaluation. However, as new NLG tasks emerge, the criteria for assessing text quality can vary greatly. Consequently, these rigid evaluation methods struggle to adapt to diverse NLG tasks without extensive prompt engineering customized for each specific task. To address this limitation, we introduce Active-Critic, a novel LLM-based NLG evaluation protocol that enables LLMs to function as ''active critics.'' Specifically, our protocol comprises two key stages. In the first stage, the LLM is instructed to infer the target NLG task and establish relevant evaluation criteria from the data. Building on this self-inferred information, the second stage dynamically optimizes the prompt to guide the LLM toward more human-aligned scoring decisions, while also generating detailed explanations to justify its evaluations. Experiments across four NLG evaluation tasks show that our approach achieves stronger alignment with human judgments than state-of-the-art evaluation methods. Our comprehensive analysis further highlights the effectiveness and explainability of Active-Critic with only a small amount of labeled data.

As established scaling laws indicate, LLMs' future performance improvement depends on the amount of computing and data sources they can leverage for pre-training. Federated learning (FL) has the potential to unleash the majority of the planet's data and computational resources, which are underutilized by the data-center-focused training methodology of current LLM practice. Our work presents a robust, flexible, reproducible FL approach that enables large-scale collaboration across institutions to train LLMs. We propose a scalable deployment system called Photon to enable the investigation and development of this new training paradigm for LLM pre-training. We show that Photon can be used by organizations interested in collaborating with their private data sources and computational resources for pre-training LLMs with billions of parameters. This paradigm would mobilize more computational and data resources while matching or potentially exceeding centralized performance. We further show the effectiveness of the federated training scales with model size and present our approach for training billion-scale federated LLMs using limited resources. Thus far, we have used Photon to train LLM models to the size of 7B parameters and anticipate larger models being completed in the near future. Finally, we show that LLM training is highly resilient to the classical challenges of federated statistical and hardware heterogeneity. Furthermore, we show that convergence is robust to partial participation, opening the avenue for compute-efficient collaborative training. Photon will help data-rich actors to become the protagonists of LLMs pre-training instead of leaving the stage to compute-rich actors alone.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 15 figures, pre-print</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating SQL Understanding in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10680v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of large language models (LLMs) has significantly impacted various domains, including natural language processing (NLP) and image generation, by making complex computational tasks more accessible. While LLMs demonstrate impressive generative capabilities, there is an ongoing debate about their level of "understanding," particularly in structured domains like SQL. In this paper, we evaluate the extent to which LLMs "understand" SQL by testing them on a series of key SQL tasks. These tasks, such as syntax error detection, missing token identification, query performance prediction, query equivalence checking, and query explanation, assess the models' proficiency in recognition, context awareness, semantics, and coherence, which are essential skills for SQL understanding. We generate labeled datasets from well-known workloads, and evaluate the latest LLMs, focusing on how query complexity and syntactic features influence performance. Our results indicate that while GPT4 excels at tasks requiring recognition and context, all models struggle with deeper semantic understanding and coherence, especially in query equivalence and performance estimation, revealing the limitations of current LLMs in achieving full SQL comprehension.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages conference submission</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Model Evaluation via Matrix Nuclear-Norm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10672v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve, efficient evaluation metrics are vital for assessing their ability to compress information and reduce redundancy. While traditional metrics like Matrix Entropy offer valuable insights, they are computationally intensive for large-scale models due to their \( O(n^3) \) time complexity with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). To mitigate this issue, we introduce the Matrix Nuclear-Norm, which not only serves as a metric to quantify the data compression proficiency of LLM but also provides a convex approximation of matrix rank to capture both predictive discriminability and diversity. By employing the \( L_{1,2}\text{-norm} \) to further approximate the nuclear norm, we can effectively assess the model's information compression capabilities. This approach reduces the time complexity to \( O(n^2) \) and eliminates the need for SVD computation. Consequently, the Matrix Nuclear-Norm achieves speeds 8 to 24 times faster than Matrix Entropy for the CEREBRAS-GPT model as sizes increase from 111M to 6.7B. This performance gap becomes more pronounced with larger models, as validated in tests with other models like Pythia. Additionally, evaluations on benchmarks and model responses confirm that our proposed Matrix Nuclear-Norm is a reliable, scalable, and efficient tool for assessing LLMs' performance, striking a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.

However, our analysis of FLORES-200, FLORES+, Ethnologue, and World Development Indicators data reveals that these benefits largely favor English speakers. Speakers of languages in low-income and lower-middle-income countries face higher costs when using OpenAI's GPT models via APIs because of how the system processes the input -- tokenization. Around 1.5 billion people, speaking languages primarily from lower-middle-income countries, could incur costs that are 4 to 6 times higher than those faced by English speakers. Disparities in LLM performance are significant, and tokenization in models priced per token amplifies inequalities in access, cost, and utility. Moreover, using the quality of translation tasks as a proxy measure, we show that LLMs perform poorly in low-resource languages, presenting a ``double jeopardy" of higher costs and poor performance for these users. We also discuss the direct impact of fragmentation in tokenizing low-resource languages on climate. This underscores the need for fairer algorithm development to benefit all linguistic groups.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project GitHub repository at https://github.com/worldbank/double-jeopardy-in-llms</p></details> |

Despite the strong reasoning and generalization capabilities of LLMs, leveraging them for sensor data tasks remains largely unexplored. This gap stems from challenges like the lack of semantic context in time-series data, computational limitations, and LLMs' difficulty processing numerical inputs. To address these issues, we introduce SensorLLM, a two-stage framework to unlock LLMs' potential for sensor data tasks. In the Sensor-Language Alignment Stage, we introduce special tokens for each sensor channel and automatically generate trend-descriptive text to align sensor data with textual inputs, enabling SensorLLM to capture numerical changes, channel-specific information, and sensor data of varying lengths-capabilities that existing LLMs typically struggle with, all without the need for human annotations. Next, in Task-Aware Tuning Stage, we refine the model for HAR classification using the frozen LLM and alignment module, achieving performance on par with or surpassing state-of-the-art models. We further demonstrate that SensorLLM evolves into an effective sensor learner, reasoner, and classifier through Sensor-Language Alignment, enabling it to generalize across diverse datasets for HAR tasks. We strongly believe our work lays the stepstone for future time-series and text alignment research, offering a path toward foundation models for sensor data.</p></details> |  |
| **[A robust solver for large-scale heat transfer topology optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06850v3)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a large-scale parallel solver, specifically designed to tackle the challenges of solving high-dimensional and high-contrast linear systems in heat transfer topology optimization. The solver incorporates an interpolation technique to accelerate convergence in high-resolution domains, along with a multiscale multigrid preconditioner to handle complex coefficient fields with significant contrast. All modules of the optimization solver are implemented on a high performance computing cluster by the PETSc numerical library. Through a series of numerical investigations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing convergence and robustness during the optimization process, particularly in high-contrast scenarios with resolutions up to $1024^3$. Our performance results indicate that the proposed preconditioner achieves over $2\times$ speedup against the default algebraic multigrid in PETSc for high-contrast cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating the Risk of Health Inequity Exacerbated by Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05180v2)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models have demonstrated their potential in numerous medical applications, particularly in automating clinical trial matching for translational research and enhancing medical question answering for clinical decision support. However, our study shows that incorporating non decisive sociodemographic factors such as race, sex, income level, LGBT+ status, homelessness, illiteracy, disability, and unemployment into the input of LLMs can lead to incorrect and harmful outputs for these populations. These discrepancies risk exacerbating existing health disparities if LLMs are widely adopted in healthcare. To address this issue, we introduce EquityGuard, a novel framework designed to detect and mitigate the risk of health inequities in LLM based medical applications. Our evaluation demonstrates its efficacy in promoting equitable outcomes across diverse populations.</p></details> |  |

However, adapting LLMs to downstream applications requires computationally intensive and memory-demanding fine-tuning procedures. To alleviate these burdens, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques have emerged as a promising approach to tailor LLMs with minimal computational overhead. While PEFT methods offer substantial advantages, they do not fully address the pervasive issue of bias propagation from pre-training data. This work introduces Bias-Alleviating Low-Rank Adaptation (BA-LoRA), a novel PEFT method designed to counteract bias inheritance. BA-LoRA incorporates three distinct regularization terms: (1) a consistency regularizer, (2) a diversity regularizer, and (3) a singular value decomposition regularizer. These regularizers aim to enhance the models' consistency, diversity, and generalization capabilities during fine-tuning. We conduct extensive experiments on natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG) tasks using prominent LLMs such as LLaMA, Mistral, and Gemma. The results demonstrate that BA-LoRA outperforms LoRA and its state-of-the-art variants. Moreover, our method effectively mitigates the adverse effects of pre-training bias, leading to more reliable and robust model outputs. The code is available at https://github.com/cyp-jlu-ai/BA-LoRA.</p></details> | 23 pages |

This study examines ChatGPT's ability to predict human performance in a language-based memory task. Following theories of text comprehension, we hypothesized that recognizing ambiguous sentences is easier with relevant preceding context. Participants, including humans and ChatGPT, were given pairs of sentences: the second always a garden-path sentence, and the first providing either fitting or unfitting context. We measured their ratings of sentence relatedness and memorability. Results showed a strong alignment between ChatGPT's assessments and human memory performance. Sentences in the fitting context were rated as being more related and memorable by ChatGPT and were better remembered by humans, highlighting LLMs' potential to predict human performance and contribute to psychological theories.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

To improve LMM model performance on underrepresented data, we propose and evaluate several prompting strategies using non-English, geographic, and socioeconomic attributes. We show that these geographic and socioeconomic integrated prompts favor retrieving topic appearances commonly found in data from low-income households across different countries leading to improved LMM model performance on lower-income data. Our analyses identify and highlight contexts where these strategies yield the most improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[eXponential FAmily Dynamical Systems (XFADS): Large-scale nonlinear Gaussian state-space modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01371v3)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-space graphical models and the variational autoencoder framework provide a principled apparatus for learning dynamical systems from data. State-of-the-art probabilistic approaches are often able to scale to large problems at the cost of flexibility of the variational posterior or expressivity of the dynamics model. However, those consolidations can be detrimental if the ultimate goal is to learn a generative model capable of explaining the spatiotemporal structure of the data and making accurate forecasts. We introduce a low-rank structured variational autoencoding framework for nonlinear Gaussian state-space graphical models capable of capturing dense covariance structures that are important for learning dynamical systems with predictive capabilities. Our inference algorithm exploits the covariance structures that arise naturally from sample based approximate Gaussian message passing and low-rank amortized posterior updates -- effectively performing approximate variational smoothing with time complexity scaling linearly in the state dimensionality. In comparisons with other deep state-space model architectures our approach consistently demonstrates the ability to learn a more predictive generative model. Furthermore, when applied to neural physiological recordings, our approach is able to learn a dynamical system capable of forecasting population spiking and behavioral correlates from a small portion of single trials.</p></details> |  |

A Study on the Impact of Format Restrictions on Performance of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02442v3)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Structured generation, the process of producing content in standardized formats like JSON and XML, is widely utilized in real-world applications to extract key output information from large language models (LLMs). This study investigates whether such constraints on generation space impact LLMs abilities, including reasoning and domain knowledge comprehension. Specifically, we evaluate LLMs performance when restricted to adhere to structured formats versus generating free-form responses across various common tasks. Surprisingly, we observe a significant decline in LLMs reasoning abilities under format restrictions. Furthermore, we find that stricter format constraints generally lead to greater performance degradation in reasoning tasks.</p></details> | 18 pages |

The long-standing endeavor of design automation has gained new momentum with the rise of large language models (LLMs). This paper introduces Language Hyper-Heuristics (LHHs), an emerging variant of Hyper-Heuristics that leverages LLMs for heuristic generation, featuring minimal manual intervention and open-ended heuristic spaces. To empower LHHs, we present Reflective Evolution (ReEvo), a novel integration of evolutionary search for efficiently exploring the heuristic space, and LLM reflections to provide verbal gradients within the space. Across five heterogeneous algorithmic types, six different COPs, and both white-box and black-box views of COPs, ReEvo yields state-of-the-art and competitive meta-heuristics, evolutionary algorithms, heuristics, and neural solvers, while being more sample-efficient than prior LHHs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Existing methods, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and differentially private data synthesis, often compromise either the utility of domain knowledge or the privacy of sensitive data, limiting their applicability in specialized domains. To address these challenges, we propose \textit{Llamdex}, a novel framework that integrates privacy-preserving, domain-specific models into LLMs. Our approach significantly enhances the accuracy of domain-specific tasks, achieving up to a 26\% improvement compared to existing methods under the same differential privacy constraints. Experimental results show that Llamdex not only improves the accuracy of LLM responses but also maintains comparable inference efficiency to the original LLM, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, widely used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have notable drawbacks: CNNs may be limited by insufficient remote sensing modeling capability, while Transformers face challenges due to computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a remote-sensing image semantic segmentation network named LKASeg, which combines Large Kernel Attention(LSKA) and Full-Scale Skip Connections(FSC). Specifically, we propose a decoder based on Large Kernel Attention (LKA), which extract global features while avoiding the computational overhead of self-attention and providing channel adaptability. To achieve full-scale feature learning and fusion, we apply Full-Scale Skip Connections (FSC) between the encoder and decoder. We conducted experiments by combining the LKA-based decoder with FSC. On the ISPRS Vaihingen dataset, the mF1 and mIoU scores achieved 90.33% and 82.77%.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is under consideration at 2025 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2025)</p></details> |

However, legal applications demand high standards of accuracy, reliability, and fairness. Applying existing LLMs to legal systems without careful evaluation of their potential and limitations could pose significant risks in legal practice. To this end, we introduce a standardized comprehensive Chinese legal benchmark LexEval. This benchmark is notable in the following three aspects: (1) Ability Modeling: We propose a new taxonomy of legal cognitive abilities to organize different tasks. (2) Scale: To our knowledge, LexEval is currently the largest Chinese legal evaluation dataset, comprising 23 tasks and 14,150 questions. (3) Data: we utilize formatted existing datasets, exam datasets and newly annotated datasets by legal experts to comprehensively evaluate the various capabilities of LLMs. LexEval not only focuses on the ability of LLMs to apply fundamental legal knowledge but also dedicates efforts to examining the ethical issues involved in their application. We evaluated 38 open-source and commercial LLMs and obtained some interesting findings. The experiments and findings offer valuable insights into the challenges and potential solutions for developing Chinese legal systems and LLM evaluation pipelines. The LexEval dataset and leaderboard are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/CSHaitao/LexEval} and will be continuously updated.</p></details> | NeurIPs 2024 |

Compared to non-generative LLMs like BERT and DeBERTa, generative LLMs like GPT series and Llama series are currently the main focus due to their superior algorithmic performance. The advancements in generative LLMs are closely intertwined with the development of hardware capabilities. Various hardware platforms exhibit distinct hardware characteristics, which can help improve LLM inference performance. Therefore, this paper comprehensively surveys efficient generative LLM inference on different hardware platforms. First, we provide an overview of the algorithm architecture of mainstream generative LLMs and delve into the inference process. Then, we summarize different optimization methods for different platforms such as CPU, GPU, FPGA, ASIC, and PIM/NDP, and provide inference results for generative LLMs. Furthermore, we perform a qualitative and quantitative comparison of inference performance with batch sizes 1 and 8 on different hardware platforms by considering hardware power consumption, absolute inference speed (tokens/s), and energy efficiency (tokens/J). We compare the performance of the same optimization methods across different hardware platforms, the performance across different hardware platforms, and the performance of different methods on the same hardware platform. This provides a systematic and comprehensive summary of existing inference acceleration work by integrating software optimization methods and hardware platforms, which can point to the future trends and potential developments of generative LLMs and hardware technology for edge-side scenarios.</p></details> | 43 pages, 15 figures |

Motivated by this, we study how LLMs answer multi-hop queries such as "The spouse of the performer of Imagine is". These queries require two information extraction steps: a latent one for resolving the first hop ("the performer of Imagine") into the bridge entity (John Lennon), and another for resolving the second hop ("the spouse of John Lennon") into the target entity (Yoko Ono). Understanding how the latent step is computed internally is key to understanding the overall computation. By carefully analyzing the internal computations of transformer-based LLMs, we discover that the bridge entity is resolved in the early layers of the model. Then, only after this resolution, the two-hop query is solved in the later layers. Because the second hop commences in later layers, there could be cases where these layers no longer encode the necessary knowledge for correctly predicting the answer. Motivated by this, we propose a novel "back-patching" analysis method whereby a hidden representation from a later layer is patched back to an earlier layer. We find that in up to 66% of previously incorrect cases there exists a back-patch that results in the correct generation of the answer, showing that the later layers indeed sometimes lack the needed functionality. Overall, our methods and findings open further opportunities for understanding and improving latent reasoning in transformer-based LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

In Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), agents interacting within a society are equipped to possess social capabilities such as reasoning about norms and trust. Norms have long been of interest within the Normative Multi-Agent Systems community with researchers studying topics such as norm emergence, norm violation detection and sanctioning. However, these studies have some limitations: they are often limited to simple domains, norms have been represented using a variety of representations with no standard approach emerging, and the symbolic reasoning mechanisms generally used may suffer from a lack of extensibility and robustness. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer opportunities to discover and reason about norms across a large range of social situations. This paper evaluates the capability of LLMs to detecting norm violations. Based on simulated data from 80 stories in a household context, with varying complexities, we investigated whether 10 norms are violated. For our evaluations we first obtained the ground truth from three human evaluators for each story. Then, the majority result was compared against the results from three well-known LLM models (Llama 2 7B, Mixtral 7B and ChatGPT-4). Our results show the promise of ChatGPT-4 for detecting norm violations, with Mixtral some distance behind. Also, we identify areas where these models perform poorly and discuss implications for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in COINE@AAMAS-2024 Springer LNCS post-proceedings</p></details> |

However, black box models are often inflexible when switching between tasks, and their results typically lack explanations. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), their flexibility has introduced new approaches to the field. Also due to the generative nature, they can be prompted to explain decision-making processes. However, their performance on complex psychological analysis still lags behind deep learning. In this paper, we introduce the first multi-task Chinese Social Media Interpretable Mental Health Instructions (C-IMHI) dataset, consisting of 9K samples, which has been quality-controlled and manually validated. We also propose MentalGLM series models, the first open-source LLMs designed for explainable mental health analysis targeting Chinese social media, trained on a corpus of 50K instructions. The proposed models were evaluated on three downstream tasks and achieved better or comparable performance compared to deep learning models, generalized LLMs, and task fine-tuned LLMs. We validated a portion of the generated decision explanations with experts, showing promising results. We also evaluated the proposed models on a clinical dataset, where they outperformed other LLMs, indicating their potential applicability in the clinical field. Our models show strong performance, validated across tasks and perspectives. The decision explanations enhance usability and facilitate better understanding and practical application of the models. Both the constructed dataset and the models are publicly available via: https://github.com/zwzzzQAQ/MentalGLM.</p></details> |  |

This study systematically evaluates translation bias and the effectiveness of LLMs for cross-lingual claim verification across 15 languages from five language families: Romance, Slavic, Turkic, Indo-Aryan, and Kartvelian. Using the XFACT dataset to assess their impact on accuracy and bias, we investigate two distinct translation methods: pre-translation and self-translation. We use mBERT's performance on the English dataset as a baseline to compare language-specific accuracies. Our findings reveal that low-resource languages exhibit significantly lower accuracy in direct inference due to underrepresentation in the training data. Furthermore, larger models demonstrate superior performance in self-translation, improving translation accuracy and reducing bias. These results highlight the need for balanced multilingual training, especially in low-resource languages, to promote equitable access to reliable fact-checking tools and minimize the risk of spreading misinformation in different linguistic contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ATTRIB @ NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[LoLCATs: On Low-Rank Linearizing of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10254v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works show we can linearize large language models (LLMs) -- swapping the quadratic attentions of popular Transformer-based LLMs with subquadratic analogs, such as linear attention -- avoiding the expensive pretraining costs. However, linearizing LLMs often significantly degrades model quality, still requires training over billions of tokens, and remains limited to smaller 1.3B to 7B LLMs. We thus propose Low-rank Linear Conversion via Attention Transfer (LoLCATs), a simple two-step method that improves LLM linearizing quality with orders of magnitudes less memory and compute. We base these steps on two findings. First, we can replace an LLM's softmax attentions with closely-approximating linear attentions, simply by training the linear attentions to match their softmax counterparts with an output MSE loss ("attention transfer"). Then, this enables adjusting for approximation errors and recovering LLM quality simply with low-rank adaptation (LoRA). LoLCATs significantly improves linearizing quality, training efficiency, and scalability. We significantly reduce the linearizing quality gap and produce state-of-the-art subquadratic LLMs from Llama 3 8B and Mistral 7B v0.1, leading to 20+ points of improvement on 5-shot MMLU. Furthermore, LoLCATs does so with only 0.2% of past methods' model parameters and 0.4% of their training tokens. Finally, we apply LoLCATs to create the first linearized 70B and 405B LLMs (50x larger than prior work). When compared with prior approaches under the same compute budgets, LoLCATs significantly improves linearizing quality, closing the gap between linearized and original Llama 3.1 70B and 405B LLMs by 77.8% and 78.1% on 5-shot MMLU.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages, 20 figures, 18 tables, preprint</p></details> |

However, despite these strengths, they face significant challenges in the increasingly critical task of Image Forgery Detection and Localization (IFDL). Moreover, existing IFDL methods are typically limited to the learning of low-level semantic-agnostic clues and merely provide a single outcome judgment. To tackle these issues, we propose ForgeryGPT, a novel framework that advances the IFDL task by capturing high-order forensics knowledge correlations of forged images from diverse linguistic feature spaces, while enabling explainable generation and interactive dialogue through a newly customized Large Language Model (LLM) architecture. Specifically, ForgeryGPT enhances traditional LLMs by integrating the Mask-Aware Forgery Extractor, which enables the excavating of precise forgery mask information from input images and facilitating pixel-level understanding of tampering artifacts. The Mask-Aware Forgery Extractor consists of a Forgery Localization Expert (FL-Expert) and a Mask Encoder, where the FL-Expert is augmented with an Object-agnostic Forgery Prompt and a Vocabulary-enhanced Vision Encoder, allowing for effectively capturing of multi-scale fine-grained forgery details. To enhance its performance, we implement a three-stage training strategy, supported by our designed Mask-Text Alignment and IFDL Task-Specific Instruction Tuning datasets, which align vision-language modalities and improve forgery detection and instruction-following capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | 16 pages, 14 figures |

Specifically, we propose meta-buffer to store a series of informative high-level thoughts, namely thought-template, distilled from the problem-solving processes across various tasks. Then for each problem, we retrieve a relevant thought-template and adaptively instantiate it with specific reasoning structures to conduct efficient reasoning. To guarantee the scalability and stability, we further propose buffer-manager to dynamically update the meta-buffer, thus enhancing the capacity of meta-buffer as more tasks are solved. We conduct extensive experiments on 10 challenging reasoning-intensive tasks, and achieve significant performance improvements over previous SOTA methods: 11% on Game of 24, 20% on Geometric Shapes and 51% on Checkmate-in-One. Further analysis demonstrate the superior generalization ability and model robustness of our BoT, while requiring only 12% of the cost of multi-query prompting methods (e.g., tree/graph of thoughts) on average. Notably, we find that our Llama3-8B+BoT has the potential to surpass Llama3-70B model.

| **[Large Language Model-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning for Generic Bus Holding Control Strategies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10212v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bus holding control is a widely-adopted strategy for maintaining stability and improving the operational efficiency of bus systems. Traditional model-based methods often face challenges with the low accuracy of bus state prediction and passenger demand estimation. In contrast, Reinforcement Learning (RL), as a data-driven approach, has demonstrated great potential in formulating bus holding strategies. RL determines the optimal control strategies in order to maximize the cumulative reward, which reflects the overall control goals. However, translating sparse and delayed control goals in real-world tasks into dense and real-time rewards for RL is challenging, normally requiring extensive manual trial-and-error. In view of this, this study introduces an automatic reward generation paradigm by leveraging the in-context learning and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). This new paradigm, termed the LLM-enhanced RL, comprises several LLM-based modules: reward initializer, reward modifier, performance analyzer, and reward refiner. These modules cooperate to initialize and iteratively improve the reward function according to the feedback from training and test results for the specified RL-based task. Ineffective reward functions generated by the LLM are filtered out to ensure the stable evolution of the RL agents' performance over iterations. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed LLM-enhanced RL paradigm, it is applied to various bus holding control scenarios, including a synthetic single-line system and a real-world multi-line system. The results demonstrate the superiority and robustness of the proposed paradigm compared to vanilla RL strategies, the LLM-based controller, and conventional space headway-based feedback control. This study sheds light on the great potential of utilizing LLMs in various smart mobility applications.</p></details> | 41 pages, 15 figures |

However, many challenging video tasks remain under-explored. Video-language tasks necessitate spatial and temporal comprehension and require significant compute. Therefore, prior works have developed complex, highly specialized architectures or leveraged additional input signals such as video transcripts to best encode contextual and temporal information, which limits their generality and can be impractical. One particularly challenging task is video moment retrieval, which requires precise temporal and contextual grounding. This work demonstrates the surprising effectiveness of leveraging image-text pretrained MLLMs for moment retrieval. We introduce Mr. BLIP (Mr. as in Moment Retrieval), a multimodal, single-stage model that requires no expensive video-language pretraining, no additional input signal (e.g., no transcript or audio), and has a simpler and more versatile design than prior state-of-the-art methods. We achieve a new state-of-the-art in moment retrieval on the widely used benchmarks Charades-STA, QVHighlights, and ActivityNet Captions. Notably, we attain over 9% (absolute) higher Recall (at 0.5 and 0.7 IoU) on the challenging long-video multi-moment QVHighlights benchmark.

As LLMs continue to advance, it is crucial to develop diverse and appropriate metrics for their evaluation. In this paper, we introduce a novel rank-based metric, Diff-eRank, grounded in information theory and geometry principles. Diff-eRank assesses LLMs by analyzing their hidden representations, providing a quantitative measure of how efficiently they eliminate redundant information during training. We demonstrate the applicability of Diff-eRank in both single-modal (e.g., language) and multi-modal settings. For language models, our results show that Diff-eRank increases with model size and correlates well with conventional metrics such as loss and accuracy. In the multi-modal context, we propose an alignment evaluation method based on the eRank, and verify that contemporary multi-modal LLMs exhibit strong alignment performance based on our method. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/waltonfuture/Diff-eRank.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Despite significant advancements, the evaluation of this capability remains insufficient. Existing benchmarks suffer from limitations in data scale, scope, and evaluation depth, while current evaluation metrics are often costly or biased, lacking in reliability for practical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce MMIE, a large-scale knowledge-intensive benchmark for evaluating interleaved multimodal comprehension and generation in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). MMIE comprises 20K meticulously curated multimodal queries, spanning 3 categories, 12 fields, and 102 subfields, including mathematics, coding, physics, literature, health, and arts. It supports both interleaved inputs and outputs, offering a mix of multiple-choice and open-ended question formats to evaluate diverse competencies. Moreover, we propose a reliable automated evaluation metric, leveraging a scoring model fine-tuned with human-annotated data and systematic evaluation criteria, aimed at reducing bias and improving evaluation accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and metrics in providing a comprehensive evaluation of interleaved LVLMs. Specifically, we evaluate eight LVLMs, revealing that even the best models show significant room for improvement, with most achieving only moderate results. We believe MMIE will drive further advancements in the development of interleaved LVLMs. We publicly release our benchmark and code in https://mmie-bench.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[White-box Multimodal Jailbreaks Against Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17894v2)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have underscored their superiority in various multimodal tasks. However, the adversarial robustness of VLMs has not been fully explored. Existing methods mainly assess robustness through unimodal adversarial attacks that perturb images, while assuming inherent resilience against text-based attacks. Different from existing attacks, in this work we propose a more comprehensive strategy that jointly attacks both text and image modalities to exploit a broader spectrum of vulnerability within VLMs. Specifically, we propose a dual optimization objective aimed at guiding the model to generate affirmative responses with high toxicity. Our attack method begins by optimizing an adversarial image prefix from random noise to generate diverse harmful responses in the absence of text input, thus imbuing the image with toxic semantics. Subsequently, an adversarial text suffix is integrated and co-optimized with the adversarial image prefix to maximize the probability of eliciting affirmative responses to various harmful instructions. The discovered adversarial image prefix and text suffix are collectively denoted as a Universal Master Key (UMK). When integrated into various malicious queries, UMK can circumvent the alignment defenses of VLMs and lead to the generation of objectionable content, known as jailbreaks. The experimental results demonstrate that our universal attack strategy can effectively jailbreak MiniGPT-4 with a 96% success rate, highlighting the vulnerability of VLMs and the urgent need for new alignment strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can We Predict Performance of Large Models across Vision-Language Tasks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10112v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating large vision-language models (LVLMs) is very expensive, due to the high computational costs and the wide variety of tasks. The good news is that if we already have some observed performance scores, we may be able to infer unknown ones. In this study, we propose a new framework for predicting unknown performance scores based on observed ones from other LVLMs or tasks. We first formulate the performance prediction as a matrix completion task. Specifically, we construct a sparse performance matrix $\boldsymbol{R}$, where each entry $R_{mn}$ represents the performance score of the $m$-th model on the $n$-th dataset. By applying probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), we can complete the performance matrix, that is, predict unknown scores. Additionally, we estimate the uncertainty of performance prediction based on MCMC. Practitioners can evaluate their models on untested tasks with higher uncertainty first, quickly reducing errors in performance prediction. We further introduce several improvements to enhance PMF for scenarios with sparse observed performance scores. In experiments, we systematically evaluate 108 LVLMs on 176 datasets from 36 benchmarks, constructing training and testing sets for validating our framework. Our experiments demonstrate the accuracy of PMF in predicting unknown scores, the reliability of uncertainty estimates in ordering evaluations, and the effectiveness of our enhancements for handling sparse data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review.

Despite recent research aiming to improve prediction efficiency, multi-sample speculative decoding has been overlooked due to varying numbers of accepted tokens within a batch in the verification phase. Vanilla method adds padding tokens in order to ensure that the number of new tokens remains consistent across samples. However, this increases the computational and memory access overhead, thereby reducing the speedup ratio. We propose a novel method that can resolve the issue of inconsistent tokens accepted by different samples without necessitating an increase in memory or computing overhead. Furthermore, our proposed method can handle the situation where the prediction tokens of different samples are inconsistent without the need to add padding tokens. Sufficient experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/niyunsheng/EMS-SD.</p></details> |  |

A Self-Imitation Learning Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10093v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel generalized self-imitation learning ($\textbf{GSIL}$) framework, which effectively and efficiently aligns large language models with offline demonstration data. We develop $\textbf{GSIL}$ by deriving a surrogate objective of imitation learning with density ratio estimates, facilitating the use of self-generated data and optimizing the imitation learning objective with simple classification losses. $\textbf{GSIL}$ eliminates the need for complex adversarial training in standard imitation learning, achieving lightweight and efficient fine-tuning for large language models. In addition, $\textbf{GSIL}$ encompasses a family of offline losses parameterized by a general class of convex functions for density ratio estimation and enables a unified view for alignment with demonstration data. Extensive experiments show that $\textbf{GSIL}$ consistently and significantly outperforms baselines in many challenging benchmarks, such as coding (HuamnEval), mathematical reasoning (GSM8K) and instruction-following benchmark (MT-Bench).</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 Main |

Noticing preliminary inadequacies in those benchmarks, we embarked on a study to critically assess 23 state-of-the-art LLM benchmarks, using our novel unified evaluation framework through the lenses of people, process, and technology, under the pillars of benchmark functionality and integrity. Our research uncovered significant limitations, including biases, difficulties in measuring genuine reasoning, adaptability, implementation inconsistencies, prompt engineering complexity, evaluator diversity, and the overlooking of cultural and ideological norms in one comprehensive assessment. Our discussions emphasized the urgent need for standardized methodologies, regulatory certainties, and ethical guidelines in light of Artificial Intelligence (AI) advancements, including advocating for an evolution from static benchmarks to dynamic behavioral profiling to accurately capture LLMs' complex behaviors and potential risks. Our study highlighted the necessity for a paradigm shift in LLM evaluation methodologies, underlining the importance of collaborative efforts for the development of universally accepted benchmarks and the enhancement of AI systems' integration into society.</p></details> |  |

We also study the reason behind the effectiveness of our method with tools from neural tangent kernel theory. We empirically demonstrate that our kernel, constructed using a restricted set of row and column parameters, are numerically close to the full-parameter kernel and gives comparable classification performance. Ablation studies are conducted to investigate the impact of different algorithmic choices, including the selection strategy for rows and columns as well as the optimal rank for effective implementation of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>RoCoF...</summary><p>RoCoFT is a parameter-efficient method</p></details> |

This approach helps address one of the limiting factors of digital trace data - their lack of an inherent target of measurement. However, this approach is also a form of psychological measurement (using observable variables to quantify a hypothetical latent construct). As such, these ratings are subject to the same psychometric considerations of reliability and validity as more standard psychological measures. Here we present a workflow for developing and evaluating large language model based measures of psychological features which incorporate these considerations. We also provide an example, attempting to measure the previously established constructs of attitude certainty, importance and moralization from text. Using a pool of prompts adapted from existing measurement instruments, we find they have good levels of internal consistency but only partially meet validity criteria.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added example applying the approach to measuring attitude properties from Twitter data</p></details> |

The choice of datasets for fine-tuning can be diverse, introducing safety concerns regarding the potential inclusion of harmful data samples. Manually filtering or avoiding such samples, however, can be labor-intensive and subjective. To address these difficulties, we propose a novel Safety-Aware Fine-Tuning (SAFT) framework designed to automatically detect and remove potentially harmful data, by leveraging a scoring function that exploits the subspace information of harmful and benign samples. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of SAFT across different LLMs and varying contamination rates, achieving reductions in harmfulness of up to 27.8%. Going beyond, we delve into the mechanism of our approach and validate its versatility in addressing practical challenges in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Safe Generative AI</p></details> |

As models scale, compression techniques become essential for balancing model quality with computational efficiency. Structured pruning, which removes less critical components of the model, is a promising strategy for reducing complexity. However, one-shot pruning often results in significant quality degradation, particularly in tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. To recover lost quality, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is commonly applied, but it can lead to catastrophic forgetting by shifting the model's learned data distribution. Therefore, addressing the degradation from both pruning and SFT is essential to preserve the original model's quality. In this work, we propose self-data distilled fine-tuning to address these challenges. Our approach leverages the original, unpruned model to generate a distilled dataset that preserves semantic richness and mitigates catastrophic forgetting by maintaining alignment with the base model's knowledge. Empirically, we demonstrate that self-data distillation consistently outperforms standard SFT, improving average accuracy by up to 8% on the HuggingFace OpenLLM Leaderboard v1. Specifically, when pruning 6 decoder blocks on Llama3.1-8B Instruct (i.e., 32 to 24 layers, reducing the model size from 8.03B to 6.72B parameters), our method retains 91.2% of the original model's accuracy compared to 81.7% with SFT, while reducing real-world FLOPs by 16.30%. Furthermore, our approach scales effectively across datasets, with the quality improving as the dataset size increases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the NeurIPS 2024 Machine Learning and Compression Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Towards Robust and Cost-Efficient Knowledge Unlearning for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06621v2)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning and memorization capabilities via pretraining on massive textual corpora. However, this poses risk of privacy and copyright violations, highlighting the need for efficient machine unlearning methods that remove sensitive data without retraining from scratch. While Gradient Ascent (GA) is commonly used to unlearn by reducing the likelihood of generating unwanted content, it leads to unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting of retrained knowledge. We also find that combining GA with low-rank adaptation results in poor trade-offs between computational cost and generative performance. To address these challenges, we propose two novel techniques for robust and efficient unlearning for LLMs. First, we introduce Inverted Hinge loss, which suppresses unwanted tokens while maintaining fluency by boosting the probability of the next most likely token. Second, we develop a data-adaptive initialization for LoRA adapters via low-rank approximation weighted with relative Fisher information, thereby focusing updates on parameters critical for removing targeted knowledge. Experiments on the Training Data Extraction Challenge dataset using GPT-Neo models as well as on the TOFU benchmark with Phi-1.5B and Llama2-7B models demonstrate that our approach effectively removes sensitive information while maintaining reasoning and generative capabilities with minimal impact.</p></details> | Preprint |

Several benchmarks have been created to gauge the hallucination levels of MLLMs, by either raising discriminative questions about the existence of objects or introducing LLM evaluators to score the generated text from MLLMs. However, the discriminative data largely involve simple questions that are not aligned with real-world text, while the generative data involve LLM evaluators that are computationally intensive and unstable due to their inherent randomness. We propose LongHalQA, an LLM-free hallucination benchmark that comprises 6K long and complex hallucination text. LongHalQA is featured by GPT4V-generated hallucinatory data that are well aligned with real-world scenarios, including object/image descriptions and multi-round conversations with 14/130 words and 189 words, respectively, on average. It introduces two new tasks, hallucination discrimination and hallucination completion, unifying both discriminative and generative evaluations in a single multiple-choice-question form and leading to more reliable and efficient evaluations without the need for LLM evaluators. Further, we propose an advanced pipeline that greatly facilitates the construction of future hallucination benchmarks with long and complex questions and descriptions. Extensive experiments over multiple recent MLLMs reveal various new challenges when they are handling hallucinations with long and complex textual data.

Large-scale pre-training has emerged as a promising label-efficient solution, owing to the utilization of large-scale data, large models, and advanced pre-training techniques. However, its development in medical images remains underexplored. The primary challenge lies in harnessing large-scale unlabeled data and learning high-level semantics without annotations. We observe that 3D medical images exhibit consistent geometric context, i.e., consistent geometric relations between different organs, which leads to a promising way for learning consistent representations. Motivated by this, we introduce a simple-yet-effective Volume Contrast (VoCo) framework to leverage geometric context priors for self-supervision. Given an input volume, we extract base crops from different regions to construct positive and negative pairs for contrastive learning. Then we predict the contextual position of a random crop by contrasting its similarity to the base crops. In this way, VoCo encodes the inherent geometric context into model representations, facilitating high-level semantic learning without annotations. Specifically, we (1) introduce the largest medical pre-training dataset PreCT-160K; (2) investigate scaling laws and propose guidelines for tailoring different model sizes to various medical tasks; (3) build a benchmark encompassing 48 medical tasks. Extensive experiments highlight the superiority of VoCo. Codes at https://github.com/Luffy03/Large-Scale-Medical.</p></details> | CVPR 2024 Extension |

An open-world grasping system should be able to combine high-level contextual with low-level physical-geometric reasoning in order to be applicable in arbitrary scenarios. Recent works exploit the web-scale knowledge inherent in large language models (LLMs) to plan and reason in robotic context, but rely on external vision and action models to ground such knowledge into the environment and parameterize actuation. This setup suffers from two major bottlenecks: a) the LLM's reasoning capacity is constrained by the quality of visual grounding, and b) LLMs do not contain low-level spatial understanding of the world, which is essential for grasping in contact-rich scenarios. In this work we demonstrate that modern vision-language models (VLMs) are capable of tackling such limitations, as they are implicitly grounded and can jointly reason about semantics and geometry. We propose OWG, an open-world grasping pipeline that combines VLMs with segmentation and grasp synthesis models to unlock grounded world understanding in three stages: open-ended referring segmentation, grounded grasp planning and grasp ranking via contact reasoning, all of which can be applied zero-shot via suitable visual prompting mechanisms. We conduct extensive evaluation in cluttered indoor scene datasets to showcase OWG's robustness in grounding from open-ended language, as well as open-world robotic grasping experiments in both simulation and hardware that demonstrate superior performance compared to previous supervised and zero-shot LLM-based methods.

Although unified speech-text pre-training and multimodal data instruction-tuning offer considerable benefits, these methods generally entail significant resource demands and tend to overfit specific tasks. This study aims to refine the use of speech datasets for LSM training by addressing the limitations of vanilla instruction tuning. We explore the instruction-following dynamics within LSMs, identifying a critical issue termed speech anchor bias-a tendency for LSMs to over-rely on speech inputs, mistakenly interpreting the entire speech modality as directives, thereby neglecting textual instructions. To counteract this bias, we introduce a self-powered LSM that leverages augmented automatic speech recognition data generated by the model itself for more effective instruction tuning. Our experiments across a range of speech-based tasks demonstrate that self-powered LSM mitigates speech anchor bias and improves the fusion of speech and text modalities in LSMs. Data, code and scripts are freely available at https://github.com/ytf-philp/Self-powered-LSM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

However, the generated text often suffers from inaccurate grounding in the visual input, resulting in errors such as hallucination of nonexistent scene elements, missing significant parts of the scene, and inferring incorrect attributes of and relationships between objects. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework, ViGoR (Visual Grounding Through Fine-Grained Reward Modeling) that utilizes fine-grained reward modeling to significantly enhance the visual grounding of LVLMs over pre-trained baselines. This improvement is efficiently achieved using much cheaper human evaluations instead of full supervisions, as well as automated methods. We show the effectiveness of our approach through a variety of evaluation methods and benchmarks. Additionally, we released our human annotation (https://github.com/amazon-science/vigor) comprising 15,440 images and generated text pairs with fine-grained evaluations to contribute to related research in the community.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Dynamic and Textual Graph Generation Via Large-Scale LLM-based Agent Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09824v1)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph generation is a fundamental task that has been extensively studied in social, technological, and scientific analysis. For modeling the dynamic graph evolution process, traditional rule-based methods struggle to capture community structures within graphs, while deep learning methods only focus on fitting training graphs. This limits existing graph generators to producing graphs that adhere to predefined rules or closely resemble training datasets, achieving poor performance in dynamic graph generation. Given that graphs are abstract representations arising from pairwise interactions in human activities, a realistic simulation of human-wise interaction could provide deeper insights into the graph evolution mechanism. With the increasing recognition of large language models (LLMs) in simulating human behavior, we introduce GraphAgent-Generator (GAG), a novel simulation-based framework for dynamic graph generation. Without training or fine-tuning process of LLM, our framework effectively replicates seven macro-level structural characteristics in established network science theories while surpassing existing baselines in graph expansion tasks by 31\% on specific evaluation metrics. Through node classification task, we validate GAG effectively preserves characteristics of real-world network for node-wise textual features in generated text-rich graph. Furthermore, by incorporating parallel acceleration, GAG supports generating graphs with up to nearly 100,000 nodes or 10 million edges through large-scale LLM-based agent simulation, with a minimum speed-up of 90.4\%.

A promising approach to mitigate this is using Zeroth-Order (ZO) optimization, which estimates gradients to replace First-Order (FO) gradient calculations, albeit with longer training time due to its stochastic nature. By revisiting the Memory-efficient ZO (MeZO) optimizer, we discover that the full-parameter perturbation and updating processes consume over 50% of its overall fine-tuning time cost. Based on these observations, we introduce a novel layer-wise sparse computation and memory efficient ZO optimizer, named LeZO. LeZO treats layers as fundamental units for sparsification and dynamically perturbs different parameter subsets in each step to achieve full-parameter fine-tuning. LeZO incorporates layer-wise parameter sparsity in the process of simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) and ZO stochastic gradient descent (ZO-SGD). It achieves accelerated computation during perturbation and updating processes without additional memory overhead. We conduct extensive experiments with the OPT model family on the SuperGLUE benchmark and two generative tasks. The experiments show that LeZO accelerates training without compromising the performance of ZO optimization. Specifically, it achieves over 3x speedup compared to MeZO on the SST-2, BoolQ, and Copa tasks.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates whether LLMs, like humans, struggle with reverse modeling, specifically with reversed text inputs. We found that publicly available pre-trained LLMs cannot understand such inputs. However, LLMs trained from scratch with both forward and reverse texts can understand them equally well during inference. Our case study shows that different-content texts result in different losses if input (to LLMs) in different directions -- some get lower losses for forward while some for reverse. This leads us to a simple and nice solution for data selection based on the loss differences between forward and reverse directions. Using our selected data in continued pretraining can boost LLMs' performance by a large margin across different language understanding benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 Pa...</summary><p>13 Pages, 6 Figures, 7 Tables</p></details> |

Moreover, existing benchmarks only cover a limited subset of common programming languages, and thus cannot reflect the full potential of LLMs in code translation. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study to exploit the capabilities and incapabilities of LLMs in code translation tasks. We first craft a novel benchmark called PolyHumanEval by extending HumanEval to a multilingual benchmark of 14 languages. With PolyHumanEval, we then perform over 110,000 translations with bleeding-edge code LLMs. The result shows LLMs' suboptimal performance on Python to other languages and the negligible impact of widely adopted LLM optimization techniques such as conventional pre-training and instruction tuning on code translation. To further uncover the potential of LLMs in code translation, we propose two methods: (1) intermediary translation which selects an intermediary language between the source and target ones; and (2) self-training which fine-tunes LLMs on self-generated parallel data. Evaluated with CodeLlama-13B, our approach yields an average improvement of 11.7% computation accuracy on Python-to-other translations. Notably, we interestingly find that Go can serve as a lingua franca for translating between any two studied languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to APSEC 2024</p></details> |
| **[Towards a Benchmark for Large Language Models for Business Process Management Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03255v2)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An increasing number of organizations are deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) for a wide range of tasks. Despite their general utility, LLMs are prone to errors, ranging from inaccuracies to hallucinations. To objectively assess the capabilities of existing LLMs, performance benchmarks are conducted. However, these benchmarks often do not translate to more specific real-world tasks. This paper addresses the gap in benchmarking LLM performance in the Business Process Management (BPM) domain. Currently, no BPM-specific benchmarks exist, creating uncertainty about the suitability of different LLMs for BPM tasks. This paper systematically compares LLM performance on four BPM tasks focusing on small open-source models. The analysis aims to identify task-specific performance variations, compare the effectiveness of open-source versus commercial models, and assess the impact of model size on BPM task performance. This paper provides insights into the practical applications of LLMs in BPM, guiding organizations in selecting appropriate models for their specific needs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to HICSS (June 15, 2024)</p></details> |
| **[BlackDAN: A Black-Box Multi-Objective Approach for Effective and Contextual Jailbreaking of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09804v1)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across various tasks, they encounter potential security risks such as jailbreak attacks, which exploit vulnerabilities to bypass security measures and generate harmful outputs. Existing jailbreak strategies mainly focus on maximizing attack success rate (ASR), frequently neglecting other critical factors, including the relevance of the jailbreak response to the query and the level of stealthiness. This narrow focus on single objectives can result in ineffective attacks that either lack contextual relevance or are easily recognizable. In this work, we introduce BlackDAN, an innovative black-box attack framework with multi-objective optimization, aiming to generate high-quality prompts that effectively facilitate jailbreaking while maintaining contextual relevance and minimizing detectability. BlackDAN leverages Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs), specifically the NSGA-II algorithm, to optimize jailbreaks across multiple objectives including ASR, stealthiness, and semantic relevance. By integrating mechanisms like mutation, crossover, and Pareto-dominance, BlackDAN provides a transparent and interpretable process for generating jailbreaks. Furthermore, the framework allows customization based on user preferences, enabling the selection of prompts that balance harmfulness, relevance, and other factors. Experimental results demonstrate that BlackDAN outperforms traditional single-objective methods, yielding higher success rates and improved robustness across various LLMs and multimodal LLMs, while ensuring jailbreak responses are both relevant and less detectable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditional and Modal Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17169v4)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) are the topic of a growing body of research in AI and cognitive science. In this paper, we probe the extent to which twenty-nine LLMs are able to distinguish logically correct inferences from logically fallacious ones. We focus on inference patterns involving conditionals (e.g., 'If Ann has a queen, then Bob has a jack') and epistemic modals (e.g., 'Ann might have an ace', 'Bob must have a king'). These inferences have been of special interest to logicians, philosophers, and linguists, since they play a central role in the fundamental human ability to reason about distal possibilities. Assessing LLMs on these inferences is thus highly relevant to the question of how much the reasoning abilities of LLMs match those of humans. All the LLMs we tested make some basic mistakes with conditionals or modals, though zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting helps them make fewer mistakes. Even the best performing LLMs make basic errors in modal reasoning, display logically inconsistent judgments across inference patterns involving epistemic modals and conditionals, and give answers about complex conditional inferences that do not match reported human judgments. These results highlight gaps in basic logical reasoning in today's LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for The 2024 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2024).

Nonetheless, traditional motion planning approaches often face a trade-off between scalability and solution quality due to the exponential growth of the joint state space of robots. In response, this work proposes SwarmPRM, a hierarchical, scalable, computationally efficient, and risk-aware sampling-based motion planning approach for large-scale swarm robots. SwarmPRM utilizes a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to represent the swarm's macroscopic state and constructs a Probabilistic Roadmap in Gaussian space, referred to as the Gaussian roadmap, to generate a transport trajectory of GMM. This trajectory is then followed by each robot at the microscopic stage. To enhance trajectory safety, SwarmPRM incorporates the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) in the collision checking process to impart the property of risk awareness to the constructed Gaussian roadmap. SwarmPRM then crafts a linear programming formulation to compute the optimal GMM transport trajectory within this roadmap. Extensive simulations demonstrate that SwarmPRM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in computational efficiency, scalability, and trajectory quality while offering the capability to adjust the risk tolerance of generated trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IROS 2024</p></details> |

This leads to a recent trend in exploiting large language models (LLMs) for generating diverse data for potential scalable and efficient solutions. However, the extent to which LLMs can generate diverse perspectives on subjective topics is still unclear. In this study, we explore LLMs' capacity of generating diverse perspectives and rationales on subjective topics such as social norms and argumentative texts. We introduce the problem of extracting maximum diversity from LLMs. Motivated by how humans form opinions based on values, we propose a criteria-based prompting technique to ground diverse opinions. To see how far we can extract diverse perspectives from LLMs, or called diversity coverage, we employ a step-by-step recall prompting to generate more outputs from the model iteratively. Our methods, applied to various tasks, show that LLMs can indeed produce diverse opinions according to the degree of task subjectivity. We also find that LLM's performance of extracting maximum diversity is on par with human.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2024 Main Conference</p></details> |

Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been extensively studied for both images and videos. However, these studies typically focus on common scenarios. In this work, we introduce an LVLM specifically designed for surgical scenarios. We integrate visual representations of surgical images and videos into the language feature space. Consequently, we establish a LVLM model, Surgical-LLaVA, fine-tuned on instruction following data of surgical scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that Surgical-LLaVA exhibits impressive multi-modal chat abilities in surgical contexts, occasionally displaying multi-modal behaviors on unseen instructions. We conduct a quantitative evaluation of visual question-answering datasets for surgical scenarios. The results show superior performance compared to previous works, indicating the potential of our model to tackle more complex surgery scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 AIM-FM Workshop</p></details> |

These attacks introduce targeted vulnerabilities into LLMs by poisoning training samples and full-parameter fine-tuning. However, this kind of backdoor attack is limited since they require significant computational resources, especially as the size of LLMs increases. Besides, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) offers an alternative but the restricted parameter updating may impede the alignment of triggers with target labels. In this study, we first verify that backdoor attacks with PEFT may encounter challenges in achieving feasible performance. To address these issues and improve the effectiveness of backdoor attacks with PEFT, we propose a novel backdoor attack algorithm from weak to strong based on feature alignment-enhanced knowledge distillation (W2SAttack). Specifically, we poison small-scale language models through full-parameter fine-tuning to serve as the teacher model. The teacher model then covertly transfers the backdoor to the large-scale student model through feature alignment-enhanced knowledge distillation, which employs PEFT. Theoretical analysis reveals that W2SAttack has the potential to augment the effectiveness of backdoor attacks. We demonstrate the superior performance of W2SAttack on classification tasks across four language models, four backdoor attack algorithms, and two different architectures of teacher models. Experimental results indicate success rates close to 100% for backdoor attacks targeting PEFT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Generate Geospatial Code?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09738v1)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing demand for spatiotemporal data processing and geospatial modeling, automating geospatial code generation has become essential for productivity. Large language models (LLMs) show promise in code generation but face challenges like domain-specific knowledge gaps and "coding hallucinations." This paper introduces GeoCode-Eval (GCE), a framework for assessing LLMs' ability to generate geospatial code across three dimensions: "Cognition and Memory," "Comprehension and Interpretation," and "Innovation and Creation," distributed across eight capability levels. We developed a benchmark dataset, GeoCode-Bench, consisting of 5,000 multiple-choice, 1,500 fill-in-the-blank, 1,500 true/false questions, and 1,000 subjective tasks covering code summarization, generation, completion, and correction. Using GeoCode-Bench, we evaluated three commercial closed-source LLMs, four open-source general-purpose LLMs, and 14 specialized code generation models. We also conducted experiments on few-shot and zero-shot learning, Chain of Thought reasoning, and multi-round majority voting to measure their impact on geospatial code generation. Additionally, we fine-tuned the Code LLaMA-7B model using Google Earth Engine-related JavaScript, creating GEECode-GPT, and evaluated it on subjective tasks. Results show that constructing pre-training and instruction datasets significantly improves code generation, offering insights for optimizing LLMs in specific domains.</p></details> |  |

It is based on the observation that different layers have varying impacts on hidden states, enabling the identification of less important layers to be pruned.LLM-Streamline comprises two parts: layer pruning, which removes consecutive layers with the lowest importance based on target sparsity, and layer replacement, a novel module that trains a lightweight network to replace the pruned layers to mitigate performance loss. Additionally, a new metric called stability is proposed to address the limitations of the widely used accuracy metric in evaluating model compression. Experiments show that LLM-Streamline outperforms both previous and concurrent state-of-the-art pruning methods in terms of both performance and training efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[LOKI: A Comprehensive Synthetic Data Detection Benchmark using Large Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09732v1)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of AI-generated content, the future internet may be inundated with synthetic data, making the discrimination of authentic and credible multimodal data increasingly challenging. Synthetic data detection has thus garnered widespread attention, and the performance of large multimodal models (LMMs) in this task has attracted significant interest. LMMs can provide natural language explanations for their authenticity judgments, enhancing the explainability of synthetic content detection. Simultaneously, the task of distinguishing between real and synthetic data effectively tests the perception, knowledge, and reasoning capabilities of LMMs. In response, we introduce LOKI, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LMMs to detect synthetic data across multiple modalities. LOKI encompasses video, image, 3D, text, and audio modalities, comprising 18K carefully curated questions across 26 subcategories with clear difficulty levels. The benchmark includes coarse-grained judgment and multiple-choice questions, as well as fine-grained anomaly selection and explanation tasks, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of LMMs. We evaluated 22 open-source LMMs and 6 closed-source models on LOKI, highlighting their potential as synthetic data detectors and also revealing some limitations in the development of LMM capabilities.

| **[Hotfixing Large Language Models for Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05727v3)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models for Code (LLM4Code) have become an integral part of developers' workflows, assisting with tasks such as code completion and generation. However, these models are found to exhibit undesired behaviors after their release, like generating buggy code, due to their extensive training on vast amounts of source code that contain such buggy code. The training data (usually coming from open-source software) keeps evolving, e.g., developers fix the buggy code. However, adapting such evolution to mitigate LLM4Code's undesired behaviors is non-trivial, as retraining models on the updated dataset usually takes much time and resources. This motivates us to propose the concept of hotfixing LLM4Code, mitigating LLM4Code's undesired behaviors effectively and efficiently with minimal negative effects. This paper mainly focuses on hotfixing LLM4Code to make them generate less buggy code and more fixed code. We begin by demonstrating that models from the popular CodeGen family frequently generate buggy code. Then, we define three learning objectives in hotfixing and design multiple loss functions for each objective: (1) learn the desired behaviors, (2) unlearn the undesired behaviors, and (3) retain knowledge of other code. We evaluate four different fine-tuning techniques for hotfixing the models and gain the following insights. Optimizing these three learning goals together, using LoRA (low-rank adaptation), effectively influences the model's behavior. Specifically, it increases the generation of fixed code by up to 108.42% and decreases the generation of buggy code by up to 50.47%. Statistical tests confirm that hotfixing does not significantly affect the models' functional correctness on the HumanEval benchmark. Additionally, to evaluate the generalizability of hotfixing by reducing the exposure of email addresses by 99.30%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Add a...</summary><p>Add a case study on mitigting potential privacy leakage</p></details> |

In this paper, we present a plug-and-play framework that could facilitate personalized large language model assistants with evolving conditional memory. The personalized assistant focuses on intelligently preserving the knowledge and experience from the history dialogue with the user, which can be applied to future tailored responses that better align with the user's preferences. Generally, the assistant generates a set of records from the dialogue dialogue, stores them in a memory bank, and retrieves related memory to improve the quality of the response. For the crucial memory design, we explore different ways of constructing the memory and propose a new memorizing mechanism named conditional memory. We also investigate the retrieval and usage of memory in the generation process. We build the first benchmark to evaluate personalized assistants' ability from three aspects. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

Traditional crop management practices, often developed through empirical experience, face significant challenges in adapting to the dynamic nature of modern agriculture, which is influenced by factors such as climate change, soil variability, and market conditions. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs) bring transformative potential, with RL providing adaptive methodologies to learn optimal strategies and LLMs offering vast, superhuman knowledge across agricultural domains, enabling informed, context-specific decision-making. This paper systematically examines how the integration of RL and LLMs into crop management decision support systems (DSSs) can drive advancements in agricultural practice. We explore recent advancements in RL and LLM algorithms, their application within crop management, and the use of crop management simulators to develop these technologies. The convergence of RL and LLMs with crop management DSSs presents new opportunities to optimize agricultural practices through data-driven, adaptive solutions that can address the uncertainties and complexities of crop production. However, this integration also brings challenges, particularly in real-world deployment. We discuss these challenges and propose potential solutions, including the use of offline RL and enhanced LLM integration, to maximize the effectiveness and sustainability of crop management. Our findings emphasize the need for continued research and innovation to unlock the full potential of these advanced tools in transforming agricultural systems into optimal and controllable ones.</p></details> | 13 pages |

In particular, pairwise LLM evaluators, which compare two generated texts and determine the preferred one, have been employed in a wide range of applications. However, LLMs exhibit preference biases and worrying sensitivity to prompt designs. In this work, we first reveal that the predictive preference of LLMs can be highly brittle and skewed, even with semantically equivalent instructions. We find that fairer predictive preferences from LLMs consistently lead to judgments that are better aligned with humans. Motivated by this phenomenon, we propose an automatic Zero-shot Evaluation-oriented Prompt Optimization framework, ZEPO, which aims to produce fairer preference decisions and improve the alignment of LLM evaluators with human judgments. To this end, we propose a zero-shot learning objective based on the preference decision fairness. ZEPO demonstrates substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art LLM evaluators, without requiring labeled data, on representative meta-evaluation benchmarks. Our findings underscore the critical correlation between preference fairness and human alignment, positioning ZEPO as an efficient prompt optimizer for bridging the gap between LLM evaluators and human judgments.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 |

We demonstrate the efficacy of OpenR by evaluating it on the MATH dataset, utilising publicly available data and search methods. Our initial experiments confirm substantial gains, with relative improvements in reasoning and performance driven by test-time computation and reinforcement learning through process reward models.

However, it is a resource-intensive process susceptible to biases introduced by annotators. The emergence of sophisticated Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT presents a unique opportunity to modernize and streamline this complex procedure. While existing research extensively evaluates the efficacy of LLMs, as annotators, this paper delves into the biases present in LLMs, specifically GPT 3.5 and GPT 4o when annotating hate speech data. Our research contributes to understanding biases in four key categories: gender, race, religion, and disability. Specifically targeting highly vulnerable groups within these categories, we analyze annotator biases. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive examination of potential factors contributing to these biases by scrutinizing the annotated data. We introduce our custom hate speech detection dataset, HateSpeechCorpus, to conduct this research. Additionally, we perform the same experiments on the ETHOS (Mollas et al., 2022) dataset also for comparative analysis.

However, it introduces significant challenges in mechanistic interpretability, outlier feature suppression, faithful signal propagation, and computational and communication complexity of private inference. This work explores desirable activation functions in normalization-free decoder-only LLMs. Contrary to the conventional preference for the GELU in transformer-based models, our empirical findings demonstrate an {\em opposite trend} -- ReLU significantly outperforms GELU in LayerNorm-free models, leading to an {\bf 8.2\%} perplexity improvement. We discover a key issue with GELU, where early layers experience entropic overload, leading to the under-utilization of the representational capacity of attention heads. This highlights that smoother activations like GELU are {\em ill-suited} for LayerNorm-free architectures, whereas ReLU's geometrical properties -- specialization in input space and intra-class selectivity -- lead to improved learning dynamics and better information retention in the absence of LayerNorm.

Extensive empirical experiments are conducted on various question-answering tasks spanning finance, biomedicine, and open-generation domains to demonstrate that Ski significantly outperforms baseline methods by facilitating effective knowledge injection. We believe that our work is an important step towards enhancing the factual accuracy of LLM outputs by refining knowledge representation and injection capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2024 main conference long paper</p></details> |

Previous research advanced this field by adapting Large Language Models for clinical tasks, using diverse datasets to generate general EHR summaries. However, clinicians often require specific, focused summaries for quicker insights. This project builds on prior work by creating a system that generates clinician-preferred, focused summaries, improving EHR summarization for more efficient patient care. The proposed system leverages the Google Flan-T5 model to generate tailored EHR summaries based on clinician-specified topics. The approach involved fine-tuning the Flan-T5 model on an EHR question-answering dataset formatted in the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) style, which is a large-scale reading comprehension dataset with questions and answers. Fine-tuning utilized the Seq2SeqTrainer from the Hugging Face Transformers library with optimized hyperparameters. Key evaluation metrics demonstrated promising results: the system achieved an Exact Match (EM) score of 81.81%. ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) metrics showed strong performance, with ROUGE-1 at 96.03%, ROUGE-2 at 86.67%, and ROUGE-L at 96.10%. Additionally, the Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score was 63%, reflecting the model's coherence in generating summaries. By enhancing EHR summarization through LLMs, this project supports digital transformation efforts in healthcare, streamlining workflows, and enabling more personalized patient care.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches utilizing score-distillation sampling are hindered by laborious procedures that consume a significant amount of time. Furthermore, the process of first generating 2D representations and then mapping them to 3D lacks internal alignment between the two forms of representation. To address these challenges, we introduce ControLRM, an end-to-end feed-forward model designed for rapid and controllable 3D generation using a large reconstruction model (LRM). ControLRM comprises a 2D condition generator, a condition encoding transformer, and a triplane decoder transformer. Instead of training our model from scratch, we advocate for a joint training framework. In the condition training branch, we lock the triplane decoder and reuses the deep and robust encoding layers pretrained with millions of 3D data in LRM. In the image training branch, we unlock the triplane decoder to establish an implicit alignment between the 2D and 3D representations. To ensure unbiased evaluation, we curate evaluation samples from three distinct datasets (G-OBJ, GSO, ABO) rather than relying on cherry-picking manual generation. The comprehensive experiments conducted on quantitative and qualitative comparisons of 3D controllability and generation quality demonstrate the strong generalization capacity of our proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version.

Researchers typically address these issues by retrieving related knowledge from knowledge graphs or employing self-enhancement methods to elicit knowledge in LLMs. However, noisy knowledge and invalid reasoning issues hamper their ability to answer questions accurately. To this end, we propose a novel method named eliciting, filtering and integrating knowledge in large language model (LINKED). In it, we design a reward model to filter out the noisy knowledge and take the marginal consistent reasoning module to reduce invalid reasoning. With our comprehensive experiments on two complex commonsense reasoning benchmarks, our method outperforms SOTA baselines (up to 9.0% improvement of accuracy). Besides, to measure the positive and negative impact of the injected knowledge, we propose a new metric called effectiveness-preservation score for the knowledge enhancement works. Finally, through extensive experiments, we conduct an in-depth analysis and find many meaningful conclusions about LLMs in commonsense reasoning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2024 Findings</p></details> |

However, the precise definition of style and the relationship between style, data quality, and LLM performance remains unclear. This research identifies two key stylistic elements in responses: linguistic form and semantic surprisal. We find that, among training data of comparable quality, higher consistency in these response elements leads to better LLM performance. Inspired by this, we introduce Style Consistency-Aware Response Ranking (SCAR), which automatically prioritizes instruction-response pairs in the training set based on their response stylistic consistency. By selecting the most style-consistent examples, sometimes as few as 0.7% of the full dataset, the fine-tuned LLMs can match or even surpass the performance of models trained on the entire dataset in coding and open-ended question-answering benchmarks. Code and data are available at https://github.com/zhuang-li/SCAR .</p></details> | 27 pages |

Since their performance and robustness are limited by small \emph{Effective Receptive Fields} (\emph{e.g.}, 3$\times$3 kernels) and insufficient training samples, however, they are unable to extract global feature representations from vein images effectively. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{StarLKNet}, a large kernel convolution-based palm-vein identification network, with the Mixup approach.Our StarMix learns effectively the distribution of vein features to expand samples. To enable CNNs to capture comprehensive feature representations from palm-vein images, we explored the effect of convolutional kernel size on the performance of palm-vein identification networks and designed LaKNet, a network leveraging large kernel convolution and gating mechanism. In light of the current state of knowledge, this represents an inaugural instance of the deployment of a CNN with large kernels in the domain of vein identification. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate the performance of StarLKNet on two public palm-vein datasets. The results demonstrated that \textbf{StarMix} provided superior augmentation, and \textbf{LakNet} exhibited more stable performance gains compared to mainstream approaches, resulting in the highest identification accuracy and lowest identification error.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

For code generation, however, their exact mechanics and efficacy are under-explored. We thus investigate the effects of a wide range of prompting strategies with a focus on automatic re-prompting over multiple turns and computational requirements. After systematically decomposing reasoning, instruction, and execution feedback prompts, we conduct an extensive grid search on the competitive programming benchmarks CodeContests and TACO for multiple LLM families and sizes (Llama 3.0 and 3.1, 8B, 70B, 405B, and GPT-4o). Our study reveals strategies that consistently improve performance across all models with small and large sampling budgets. We then show how finetuning with such an optimal configuration allows models to internalize the induced reasoning process and obtain improvements in performance and scalability for multi-turn code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[LogicGame: Benchmarking Rule-Based Reasoning Abilities of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15778v4)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable capabilities across various tasks, showcasing complex problem-solving abilities. Understanding and executing complex rules, along with multi-step planning, are fundamental to logical reasoning and critical for practical LLM agents and decision-making systems. However, evaluating LLMs as effective rule-based executors and planners remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce LogicGame, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the comprehensive rule understanding, execution, and planning capabilities of LLMs. Unlike traditional benchmarks, LogicGame provides diverse games that contain a series of rules with an initial state, requiring models to comprehend and apply predefined regulations to solve problems. We create simulated scenarios in which models execute or plan operations to achieve specific outcomes. These game scenarios are specifically designed to distinguish logical reasoning from mere knowledge by relying exclusively on predefined rules. This separation allows for a pure assessment of rule-based reasoning capabilities. The evaluation considers not only final outcomes but also intermediate steps, providing a comprehensive assessment of model performance. Moreover, these intermediate steps are deterministic and can be automatically verified. LogicGame defines game scenarios with varying difficulty levels, from simple rule applications to complex reasoning chains, in order to offer a precise evaluation of model performance on rule understanding and multi-step execution. Utilizing LogicGame, we test various LLMs and identify notable shortcomings in their rule-based logical reasoning abilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Likelihood-based Mitigation of Evaluation Bias in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15987v3)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used to evaluate natural language generation tasks as automated metrics. However, the likelihood, a measure of LLM's plausibility for a sentence, can vary due to superficial differences in sentences, such as word order and sentence structure. It is therefore possible that there might be a likelihood bias if LLMs are used for evaluation: they might overrate sentences with higher likelihoods while underrating those with lower likelihoods. In this paper, we investigate the presence and impact of likelihood bias in LLM-based evaluators. We also propose a method to mitigate the likelihood bias. Our method utilizes highly biased instances as few-shot examples for in-context learning. Our experiments in evaluating the data-to-text and grammatical error correction tasks reveal that several LLMs we test display a likelihood bias. Furthermore, our proposed method successfully mitigates this bias, also improving evaluation performance (in terms of correlation of models with human scores) significantly.</p></details> | 5 main pages |

However, despite their impressive problem-solving skills in many domains, MLLMs' ability in industrial anomaly detection has not been systematically studied. To bridge this gap, we present MMAD, the first-ever full-spectrum MLLMs benchmark in industrial Anomaly Detection. We defined seven key subtasks of MLLMs in industrial inspection and designed a novel pipeline to generate the MMAD dataset with 39,672 questions for 8,366 industrial images. With MMAD, we have conducted a comprehensive, quantitative evaluation of various state-of-the-art MLLMs. The commercial models performed the best, with the average accuracy of GPT-4o models reaching 74.9%. However, this result falls far short of industrial requirements. Our analysis reveals that current MLLMs still have significant room for improvement in answering questions related to industrial anomalies and defects. We further explore two training-free performance enhancement strategies to help models improve in industrial scenarios, highlighting their promising potential for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code and data are available at https://github.com/jam-cc/MMAD</p></details> |
| **[Declarative Knowledge Distillation from Large Language Models for Visual Question Answering Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09428v1)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Question Answering (VQA) is the task of answering a question about an image and requires processing multimodal input and reasoning to obtain the answer. Modular solutions that use declarative representations within the reasoning component have a clear advantage over end-to-end trained systems regarding interpretability. The downside is that crafting the rules for such a component can be an additional burden on the developer. We address this challenge by presenting an approach for declarative knowledge distillation from Large Language Models (LLMs). Our method is to prompt an LLM to extend an initial theory on VQA reasoning, given as an answer-set program, to meet the requirements of the VQA task. Examples from the VQA dataset are used to guide the LLM, validate the results, and mend rules if they are not correct by using feedback from the ASP solver. We demonstrate that our approach works on the prominent CLEVR and GQA datasets. Our results confirm that distilling knowledge from LLMs is in fact a promising direction besides data-driven rule learning approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at NeLaMKRR@KR, 2024 (arXiv:2410.05339)</p></details> |

However, the creation of such data with human supervision proves costly and time-intensive. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of AI feedback to scale supervision for aligning LVLMs. We introduce VLFeedback, the first large-scale vision-language feedback dataset, comprising over 82K multi-modal instructions and comprehensive rationales generated by off-the-shelf models without human annotations. To evaluate the effectiveness of AI feedback for vision-language alignment, we train Silkie, an LVLM fine-tuned via direct preference optimization on VLFeedback. Silkie showcases exceptional performance regarding helpfulness, visual faithfulness, and safety metrics. It outperforms its base model by 6.9\% and 9.5\% in perception and cognition tasks, reduces hallucination issues on MMHal-Bench, and exhibits enhanced resilience against red-teaming attacks. Furthermore, our analysis underscores the advantage of AI feedback, particularly in fostering preference diversity to deliver more comprehensive improvements. Our dataset, training code and models are available at https://vlf-silkie.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2024 Main Conference camera-ready version.

| **[Beyond Exact Match: Semantically Reassessing Event Extraction by Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09418v1)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event extraction has gained extensive research attention due to its broad range of applications. However, the current mainstream evaluation method for event extraction relies on token-level exact match, which misjudges numerous semantic-level correct cases. This reliance leads to a significant discrepancy between the evaluated performance of models under exact match criteria and their real performance. To address this problem, we propose RAEE, an automatic evaluation framework that accurately assesses event extraction results at semantic-level instead of token-level. Specifically, RAEE leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as automatic evaluation agents, incorporating chain-of-thought prompting and an adaptive mechanism to achieve interpretable and adaptive evaluations for precision and recall of triggers and arguments. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that: (1) RAEE achieves a very high correlation with the human average; (2) after reassessing 14 models, including advanced LLMs, on 10 datasets, there is a significant performance gap between exact match and RAEE. The exact match evaluation significantly underestimates the performance of existing event extraction models, particularly underestimating the capabilities of LLMs; (3) fine-grained analysis under RAEE evaluation reveals insightful phenomena worth further exploration. The evaluation toolkit of our proposed RAEE will be publicly released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Bug Detection in Fastjson2 with Large Language Models Driven Unit Test Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09414v1)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-serialization libraries are essential tools in software development, responsible for converting between programmable data structures and data persistence formats. Among them, JSON is the most popular choice for exchanging data between different systems and programming languages, while JSON libraries serve as the programming toolkit for this task. Despite their widespread use, bugs in JSON libraries can cause severe issues such as data inconsistencies and security vulnerabilities. Unit test generation techniques are widely adopted to identify bugs in various libraries. However, there is limited systematic testing effort specifically for exposing bugs within JSON libraries in industrial practice. In this paper, we propose JSONTestGen, an approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate unit tests for fastjson2, a popular open source JSON library from Alibaba. Pre-trained on billions of open-source text and code corpora, LLMs have demonstrated remarkable abilities in programming tasks. Based on historical bug-triggering unit tests, we utilize LLMs to generate more diverse test cases by incorporating JSON domain-specific mutation rules. To systematically and efficiently identify potential bugs, we adopt differential testing on the results of the generated unit tests. Our evaluation shows that JSONTestGen outperforms existing test generation tools in unknown defect detection. With JSONTestGen, we found 34 real bugs in fastjson2, 30 of which have already been fixed, including 12 non-crashing bugs. While manual inspection reveals that LLM-generated tests can be erroneous, particularly with self-contradictory assertions, we demonstrate that LLMs have the potential for classifying false-positive test failures. This suggests a promising direction for improved test oracle automation in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models Playing Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10574v2)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI), and in particular Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant popularity among researchers and industrial communities, paving the way for integrating LLMs in different domains, such as robotics, telecom, and healthcare. In this paper, we study the intersection of game theory and generative artificial intelligence, focusing on the capabilities of LLMs to find the Nash equilibrium in games with a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium and no pure strategy Nash equilibrium (that we denote mixed strategy Nash equilibrium games). The study reveals a significant enhancement in the performance of LLMs when they are equipped with the possibility to run code and are provided with a specific prompt to incentivize them to do so. However, our research also highlights the limitations of LLMs when the randomization strategy of the game is not easy to deduce. It is evident that while LLMs exhibit remarkable proficiency in well-known standard games, their performance dwindles when faced with slight modifications of the same games. This paper aims to contribute to the growing body of knowledge on the intersection of game theory and generative artificial intelligence while providing valuable insights into LLMs strengths and weaknesses. It also underscores the need for further research to overcome the limitations of LLMs, particularly in dealing with even slightly more complex scenarios, to harness their full potential.</p></details> |  |

However, it is still unclear whether LLMs can discover novel and valid hypotheses in chemistry. In this work, we investigate this central research question: Can LLMs automatically discover novel and valid chemistry research hypotheses given only a chemistry research background (consisting of a research question and/or a background survey), without limitation on the domain of the research question? After extensive discussions with chemistry experts, we propose an assumption that a majority of chemistry hypotheses can be resulted from a research background and several inspirations. With this key insight, we break the central question into three smaller fundamental questions. In brief, they are: (1) given a background question, whether LLMs can retrieve good inspirations; (2) with background and inspirations, whether LLMs can lead to hypothesis; and (3) whether LLMs can identify good hypotheses to rank them higher. To investigate these questions, we construct a benchmark consisting of 51 chemistry papers published in Nature, Science, or a similar level in 2024 (all papers are only available online since 2024). Every paper is divided by chemistry PhD students into three components: background, inspirations, and hypothesis. The goal is to rediscover the hypothesis, given only the background and a large randomly selected chemistry literature corpus consisting the ground truth inspiration papers, with LLMs trained with data up to 2023. We also develop an LLM-based multi-agent framework that leverages the assumption, consisting of three stages reflecting the three smaller questions. The proposed method can rediscover many hypotheses with very high similarity with the ground truth ones, covering the main innovations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and Benchmark are available at https://github.com/ZonglinY/MOOSE-Chem.git</p></details> |

Existing privacy protection methods for LLMs suffer from either insufficient privacy protection, performance degradation, or large inference time overhead. To address these limitations, we propose PrivacyRestore, a plug-and-play method to protect the privacy of user inputs during LLM inference. The server first trains restoration vectors for each privacy span and then release to clients. Privacy span is defined as a contiguous sequence of tokens within a text that contain private information. The client then aggregate restoration vectors of all privacy spans in the input into a single meta restoration vector which is later sent to the server side along with the input without privacy spans.The private information is restored via activation steering during inference. Furthermore, we prove that PrivacyRestore inherently prevents the linear growth of the privacy budget.We create three datasets, covering medical and legal domains, to evaluate the effectiveness of privacy preserving methods. The experimental results show that PrivacyRestore effectively protects private information and maintain acceptable levels of performance and inference overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoTimes: Autoregressive Time Series Forecasters via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02370v3)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models of time series have not been fully developed due to the limited availability of time series corpora and the underexploration of scalable pre-training. Based on the similar sequential formulation of time series and natural language, increasing research demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging large language models (LLM) for time series. Nevertheless, the inherent autoregressive property and decoder-only architecture of LLMs have not been fully considered, resulting in insufficient utilization of LLM abilities. To fully revitalize the general-purpose token transition and multi-step generation capability of large language models, we propose AutoTimes to repurpose LLMs as autoregressive time series forecasters, which projects time series into the embedding space of language tokens and autoregressively generates future predictions with arbitrary lengths. Compatible with any decoder-only LLMs, the consequent forecaster exhibits the flexibility of the lookback length and scalability with larger LLMs. Further, we formulate time series as prompts, extending the context for prediction beyond the lookback window, termed in-context forecasting. By introducing LLM-embedded textual timestamps, AutoTimes can utilize chronological information to align multivariate time series. Empirically, AutoTimes achieves state-of-the-art with 0.1% trainable parameters and over $5\times$ training/inference speedup compared to advanced LLM-based forecasters. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/thuml/AutoTimes.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods for acquiring large-scale intentions bank on distilling large language models with human annotation for verification. Such an approach tends to generate product-centric intentions, overlook valuable visual information from product images, and incurs high costs for scalability. To address these issues, we introduce MIND, a multimodal framework that allows Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to infer purchase intentions from multimodal product metadata and prioritize human-centric ones. Using Amazon Review data, we apply MIND and create a multimodal intention knowledge base, which contains 1,264,441 million intentions derived from 126,142 co-buy shopping records across 107,215 products. Extensive human evaluations demonstrate the high plausibility and typicality of our obtained intentions and validate the effectiveness of our distillation framework and filtering mechanism. Additional experiments reveal that our obtained intentions significantly enhance large language models in two intention comprehension tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2024 main conference</p></details> |

Towards that goal, it is important to understand the 3D reasoning capabilities of current models as well as identify the gaps between these models and humans. Therefore, we construct a new 3D visual understanding benchmark that covers fundamental 3D vision tasks in the Visual Question Answering (VQA) format. We evaluate state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs), specialized models, and human subjects on it. Our results show that VLMs generally perform poorly, while the specialized models are accurate but not robust, failing under geometric perturbations. In contrast, human vision continues to be the most reliable 3D visual system. We further demonstrate that neural networks align more closely with human 3D vision mechanisms compared to classical computer vision methods, and Transformer-based networks such as ViT align more closely with human 3D vision mechanisms than CNNs. We hope our study will benefit the future development of foundation models for 3D vision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Words to Wheels: Vision-Based Autonomous Driving Understanding Human Language Instructions Using Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10577v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces an innovative application of foundation models, enabling Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) equipped with an RGB-D camera to navigate to designated destinations based on human language instructions. Unlike learning-based methods, this approach does not require prior training but instead leverages existing foundation models, thus facilitating generalization to novel environments. Upon receiving human language instructions, these are transformed into a 'cognitive route description' using a large language model (LLM)-a detailed navigation route expressed in human language. The vehicle then decomposes this description into landmarks and navigation maneuvers. The vehicle also determines elevation costs and identifies navigability levels of different regions through a terrain segmentation model, GANav, trained on open datasets. Semantic elevation costs, which take both elevation and navigability levels into account, are estimated and provided to the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) planner, responsible for local path planning. Concurrently, the vehicle searches for target landmarks using foundation models, including YOLO-World and EfficientViT-SAM. Ultimately, the vehicle executes the navigation commands to reach the designated destination, the final landmark. Our experiments demonstrate that this application successfully guides UGVs to their destinations following human language instructions in novel environments, such as unfamiliar terrain or urban settings.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Moirai-MoE: Empowering Time Series Foundation Models with Sparse Mixture of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10469v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models have demonstrated impressive performance as zero-shot forecasters. However, achieving effectively unified training on time series remains an open challenge. Existing approaches introduce some level of model specialization to account for the highly heterogeneous nature of time series data. For instance, Moirai pursues unified training by employing multiple input/output projection layers, each tailored to handle time series at a specific frequency. Similarly, TimesFM maintains a frequency embedding dictionary for this purpose. We identify two major drawbacks to this human-imposed frequency-level model specialization: (1) Frequency is not a reliable indicator of the underlying patterns in time series. For example, time series with different frequencies can display similar patterns, while those with the same frequency may exhibit varied patterns. (2) Non-stationarity is an inherent property of real-world time series, leading to varied distributions even within a short context window of a single time series. Frequency-level specialization is too coarse-grained to capture this level of diversity. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Moirai-MoE, using a single input/output projection layer while delegating the modeling of diverse time series patterns to the sparse mixture of experts (MoE) within Transformers. With these designs, Moirai-MoE reduces reliance on human-defined heuristics and enables automatic token-level specialization. Extensive experiments on 39 datasets demonstrate the superiority of Moirai-MoE over existing foundation models in both in-distribution and zero-shot scenarios. Furthermore, this study conducts comprehensive model analyses to explore the inner workings of time series MoE foundation models and provides valuable insights for future research.</p></details> |  |

However, current TAG approaches face two primary challenges: (i) Heavy reliance on label information and (ii) Limited cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability. These issues constrain the scaling of both data and model size, owing to high labor costs and scaling laws, complicating the development of graph foundation models with strong transferability. In this work, we propose the GraphCLIP framework to address these challenges by learning graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability through a self-supervised contrastive graph-summary pretraining method. Specifically, we generate and curate large-scale graph-summary pair data with the assistance of LLMs, and introduce a novel graph-summary pretraining method, combined with invariant learning, to enhance graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero-shot transferability. For few-shot learning, we propose a novel graph prompt tuning technique aligned with our pretraining objective to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and minimize learning costs. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GraphCLIP in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, while evaluations across various downstream tasks confirm the versatility of GraphCLIP. Our code is available at: https://github.com/ZhuYun97/GraphCLIP</p></details> | Under Review |

To address the need for data privacy in FM fine-tuning, federated learning has emerged as the de facto framework. Specifically, Federated FMs (FedFMs) fine-tuning using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules instead of the full model over multiple clients can achieve both parameter efficiency and data privacy. However, recent studies rarely address the challenges posed by clients with heterogeneous resources, particularly in GPU memory capacity. In this paper, we introduce Fed-piLot, an efficient FedFM fine-tuning framework with optimized local LoRA assignments for heterogeneous clients. By emphasizing the different memory consumption for training different LoRA layers, as well as the varying contributions of different layers to model performance, we formulate the LoRA assignment as a Knapsack Optimization Problem. We design a Local-Global Information Gain Score (IG-Score) based value function to optimize LoRA assignment under clients' memory constraints. To further mitigate the impact of heterogeneity in model updates, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal model aggregation (STAgg) rule using the Dynamic Weight Adjustment (DWA) strategy. Experimental results on three datasets under both IID and non-IID conditions demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Fed-piLot. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[BlockFound: Customized blockchain foundation model for anomaly detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04039v2)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose BlockFound, a customized foundation model for anomaly blockchain transaction detection. Unlike existing methods that rely on rule-based systems or directly apply off-the-shelf large language models, BlockFound introduces a series of customized designs to model the unique data structure of blockchain transactions. First, a blockchain transaction is multi-modal, containing blockchain-specific tokens, texts, and numbers. We design a modularized tokenizer to handle these multi-modal inputs, balancing the information across different modalities. Second, we design a customized mask language learning mechanism for pretraining with RoPE embedding and FlashAttention for handling longer sequences. After training the foundation model, we further design a novel detection method for anomaly detection. Extensive evaluations on Ethereum and Solana transactions demonstrate BlockFound's exceptional capability in anomaly detection while maintaining a low false positive rate. Remarkably, BlockFound is the only method that successfully detects anomalous transactions on Solana with high accuracy, whereas all other approaches achieved very low or zero detection recall scores. This work not only provides new foundation models for blockchain but also sets a new benchmark for applying LLMs in blockchain data.</p></details> |  |
| **[X-Fi: A Modality-Invariant Foundation Model for Multimodal Human Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10167v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human sensing, which employs various sensors and advanced deep learning technologies to accurately capture and interpret human body information, has significantly impacted fields like public security and robotics. However, current human sensing primarily depends on modalities such as cameras and LiDAR, each of which has its own strengths and limitations. Furthermore, existing multi-modal fusion solutions are typically designed for fixed modality combinations, requiring extensive retraining when modalities are added or removed for diverse scenarios. In this paper, we propose a modality-invariant foundation model for all modalities, X-Fi, to address this issue. X-Fi enables the independent or combinatory use of sensor modalities without additional training by utilizing a transformer structure to accommodate variable input sizes and incorporating a novel "X-fusion" mechanism to preserve modality-specific features during multimodal integration. This approach not only enhances adaptability but also facilitates the learning of complementary features across modalities. Extensive experiments conducted on the MM-Fi and XRF55 datasets, employing six distinct modalities, demonstrate that X-Fi achieves state-of-the-art performance in human pose estimation (HPE) and human activity recognition (HAR) tasks. The findings indicate that our proposed model can efficiently support a wide range of human sensing applications, ultimately contributing to the evolution of scalable, multimodal sensing technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Adaptive Few-shot Multi Label Segmentation with Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09759v1)** | 2024-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The high cost of obtaining accurate annotations for image segmentation and localization makes the use of one and few shot algorithms attractive. Several state-of-the-art methods for few-shot segmentation have emerged, including text-based prompting for the task but suffer from sub-optimal performance for medical images. Leveraging sub-pixel level features of existing Vision Transformer (ViT) based foundation models for identifying similar region of interest (RoI) based on a single template image have been shown to be very effective for one shot segmentation and localization in medical images across modalities. However, such methods rely on assumption that template image and test image are well matched and simple correlation is sufficient to obtain correspondences. In practice, however such an approach can fail to generalize in clinical data due to patient pose changes, inter-protocol variations even within a single modality or extend to 3D data using single template image. Moreover, for multi-label tasks, the RoI identification has to be performed sequentially. In this work, we propose foundation model (FM) based adapters for single label, multi-label localization and segmentation to address these concerns. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method for multiple segmentation and localization tasks for both 2D and 3D data as we well as clinical data with different poses and evaluate against the state of the art few shot segmentation methods.</p></details> |  |

We explore the rationale, design, and implementation of such registries, drawing on comparisons with registries in analogous industries to make recommendations for a registry that is efficient, unintrusive, and which will bring AI governance closer to parity with the governmental insight into other high-impact industries. We explore key information that should be collected, including model architecture, model size, compute and data used during training, and we survey the viability and utility of evaluations developed specifically for AI. Our proposal is designed to provide governmental insight and enhance AI safety while fostering innovation and minimizing the regulatory burden on developers. By providing a framework that respects intellectual property concerns and safeguards sensitive information, this registry approach supports responsible AI development without impeding progress. We propose that timely and accurate registration should be encouraged primarily through injunctive action, by requiring third parties to use only registered models, and secondarily through direct financial penalties for non-compliance. By providing a comprehensive framework for AI model registries, we aim to support policymakers in developing foundational governance structures to monitor and mitigate risks associated with advanced AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Semantic Cues from Foundation Vision Models for Enhanced Local Feature Correspondence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09533v1)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual correspondence is a crucial step in key computer vision tasks, including camera localization, image registration, and structure from motion. The most effective techniques for matching keypoints currently involve using learned sparse or dense matchers, which need pairs of images. These neural networks have a good general understanding of features from both images, but they often struggle to match points from different semantic areas. This paper presents a new method that uses semantic cues from foundation vision model features (like DINOv2) to enhance local feature matching by incorporating semantic reasoning into existing descriptors. Therefore, the learned descriptors do not require image pairs at inference time, allowing feature caching and fast matching using similarity search, unlike learned matchers. We present adapted versions of six existing descriptors, with an average increase in performance of 29% in camera localization, with comparable accuracy to existing matchers as LightGlue and LoFTR in two existing benchmarks.

While various studies have analyzed statistical, machine learning, or deep learning approaches for household electricity STLF, recently proposed time series foundation models such as Chronos, TimesFM, or LagLlama have not yet been considered for household electricity STLF. These models are trained on a vast amount of time series data and are able to forecast time series without explicit task-specific training (zero-shot learning). In this study, we benchmark the forecasting capabilities of time series foundation models compared to Trained-from-Scratch (TFS) Transformer-based approaches. Our results suggest that foundation models perform comparably to TFS Transformer models, while the TimesFM foundation model outperforms all TFS models when the input size increases. At the same time, they require less effort, as they need no domain-specific training and only limited contextual data for inference.</p></details> |  |

However, applying LoRA in federated learning environments, where data is distributed across multiple clients, presents unique challenges. Existing methods rely on traditional federated averaging of LoRA adapters, resulting in inexact updates. To address this, we propose Federated Exact LoRA, or FedEx-LoRA, which adds a residual error term to the pretrained frozen weight matrix. Our approach achieves exact updates with minimal computational and communication overhead, preserving LoRA's efficiency. We evaluate the method on various Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks, showing consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art methods across multiple settings. Through extensive analysis, we quantify that the deviations in updates from the ideal solution are significant, highlighting the need for exact aggregation. Our method's simplicity, efficiency, and broad applicability position it as a promising solution for accurate and effective federated fine-tuning of foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>RS an...</summary><p>RS and KP contributed equally to this work: 18 Pages, 9 Figures, and 8 Tables.

Despite advancements in multi-modal pre-trained models and video-language foundation models, these systems often struggle with domain-specific VideoQA due to their generalized pre-training objectives. Addressing this gap necessitates bridging the divide between broad cross-modal knowledge and the specific inference demands of VideoQA tasks. To this end, we introduce HeurVidQA, a framework that leverages domain-specific entity-action heuristics to refine pre-trained video-language foundation models. Our approach treats these models as implicit knowledge engines, employing domain-specific entity-action prompters to direct the model's focus toward precise cues that enhance reasoning. By delivering fine-grained heuristics, we improve the model's ability to identify and interpret key entities and actions, thereby enhancing its reasoning capabilities. Extensive evaluations across multiple VideoQA datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing models, underscoring the importance of integrating domain-specific knowledge into video-language models for more accurate and context-aware VideoQA.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology</p></details> |

This paper introduces a new method to tackle the Few-Shot Continual Incremental Learning (FSCIL) problem in 3D point cloud environments. We leverage a foundational 3D model trained extensively on point cloud data. Drawing from recent improvements in foundation models, known for their ability to work well across different tasks, we propose a novel strategy that does not require additional training to adapt to new tasks. Our approach uses a dual cache system: first, it uses previous test samples based on how confident the model was in its predictions to prevent forgetting, and second, it includes a small number of new task samples to prevent overfitting. This dynamic adaptation ensures strong performance across different learning tasks without needing lots of fine-tuning. We tested our approach on datasets like ModelNet, ShapeNet, ScanObjectNN, and CO3D, showing that it outperforms other FSCIL methods and demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility.

The interaction between SE and FMs has led to the integration of FMs into SE practices (FM4SE) and the application of SE methodologies to FMs (SE4FM). While several literature surveys exist on academic contributions to these trends, we are the first to provide a practitioner's view. We analyze 155 FM4SE and 997 SE4FM blog posts from leading technology companies, leveraging an FM-powered surveying approach to systematically label and summarize the discussed activities and tasks. We observed that while code generation is the most prominent FM4SE task, FMs are leveraged for many other SE activities such as code understanding, summarization, and API recommendation. The majority of blog posts on SE4FM are about model deployment & operation, and system architecture & orchestration. Although the emphasis is on cloud deployments, there is a growing interest in compressing FMs and deploying them on smaller devices such as edge or mobile devices. We outline eight future research directions inspired by our gained insights, aiming to bridge the gap between academic findings and real-world applications. Our study not only enriches the body of knowledge on practical applications of FM4SE and SE4FM but also demonstrates the utility of FMs as a powerful and efficient approach in conducting literature surveys within technical and grey literature domains.

| **[Controlling Whisper: Universal Acoustic Adversarial Attacks to Control Speech Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04482v2)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech enabled foundation models, either in the form of flexible speech recognition based systems or audio-prompted large language models (LLMs), are becoming increasingly popular. One of the interesting aspects of these models is their ability to perform tasks other than automatic speech recognition (ASR) using an appropriate prompt. For example, the OpenAI Whisper model can perform both speech transcription and speech translation. With the development of audio-prompted LLMs there is the potential for even greater control options. In this work we demonstrate that with this greater flexibility the systems can be susceptible to model-control adversarial attacks. Without any access to the model prompt it is possible to modify the behaviour of the system by appropriately changing the audio input. To illustrate this risk, we demonstrate that it is possible to prepend a short universal adversarial acoustic segment to any input speech signal to override the prompt setting of an ASR foundation model. Specifically, we successfully use a universal adversarial acoustic segment to control Whisper to always perform speech translation, despite being set to perform speech transcription. Overall, this work demonstrates a new form of adversarial attack on multi-tasking speech enabled foundation models that needs to be considered prior to the deployment of this form of model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning with Foundation Priors: Let the Embodied Agent Efficiently Learn on Its Own](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02635v4)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach for solving robotic manipulation tasks. However, it is challenging to apply the RL algorithms directly in the real world. For one thing, RL is data-intensive and typically requires millions of interactions with environments, which are impractical in real scenarios. For another, it is necessary to make heavy engineering efforts to design reward functions manually. To address these issues, we leverage foundation models in this paper. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Foundation Priors (RLFP) to utilize guidance and feedback from policy, value, and success-reward foundation models. Within this framework, we introduce the Foundation-guided Actor-Critic (FAC) algorithm, which enables embodied agents to explore more efficiently with automatic reward functions. The benefits of our framework are threefold: (1) \textit{sample efficient}; (2) \textit{minimal and effective reward engineering}; (3) \textit{agnostic to foundation model forms and robust to noisy priors}. Our method achieves remarkable performances in various manipulation tasks on both real robots and in simulation. Across 5 dexterous tasks with real robots, FAC achieves an average success rate of 86\% after one hour of real-time learning. Across 8 tasks in the simulated Meta-world, FAC achieves 100\% success rates in 7/8 tasks under less than 100k frames (about 1-hour training), outperforming baseline methods with manual-designed rewards in 1M frames. We believe the RLFP framework can enable future robots to explore and learn autonomously in the physical world for more tasks.

However, the effectiveness of these AI models is often limited by their reliance on large amounts of task-specific labeled data and their inability to generalize across diverse clinical settings. To address these challenges, we introduce CXRBase, a foundational model designed to learn versatile representations from unlabelled CXR images, facilitating efficient adaptation to various clinical tasks. CXRBase is initially trained on a substantial dataset of 1.04 million unlabelled CXR images using self-supervised learning methods. This approach allows the model to discern meaningful patterns without the need for explicit labels. After this initial phase, CXRBase is fine-tuned with labeled data to enhance its performance in disease detection, enabling accurate classification of chest diseases. CXRBase provides a generalizable solution to improve model performance and alleviate the annotation workload of experts to enable broad clinical AI applications from chest imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[CryoFM: A Flow-based Foundation Model for Cryo-EM Densities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08631v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a powerful technique in structural biology and drug discovery, enabling the study of biomolecules at high resolution. Significant advancements by structural biologists using cryo-EM have led to the production of over 38,626 protein density maps at various resolutions1. However, cryo-EM data processing algorithms have yet to fully benefit from our knowledge of biomolecular density maps, with only a few recent models being data-driven but limited to specific tasks. In this study, we present CryoFM, a foundation model designed as a generative model, learning the distribution of high-quality density maps and generalizing effectively to downstream tasks. Built on flow matching, CryoFM is trained to accurately capture the prior distribution of biomolecular density maps. Furthermore, we introduce a flow posterior sampling method that leverages CRYOFM as a flexible prior for several downstream tasks in cryo-EM and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) without the need for fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on most tasks and demonstrating its potential as a foundational model for broader applications in these fields.</p></details> |  |
| **[ONCOPILOT: A Promptable CT Foundation Model For Solid Tumor Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07908v2)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Carcinogenesis is a proteiform phenomenon, with tumors emerging in various locations and displaying complex, diverse shapes. At the crucial intersection of research and clinical practice, it demands precise and flexible assessment. However, current biomarkers, such as RECIST 1.1's long and short axis measurements, fall short of capturing this complexity, offering an approximate estimate of tumor burden and a simplistic representation of a more intricate process. Additionally, existing supervised AI models face challenges in addressing the variability in tumor presentations, limiting their clinical utility. These limitations arise from the scarcity of annotations and the models' focus on narrowly defined tasks. To address these challenges, we developed ONCOPILOT, an interactive radiological foundation model trained on approximately 7,500 CT scans covering the whole body, from both normal anatomy and a wide range of oncological cases. ONCOPILOT performs 3D tumor segmentation using visual prompts like point-click and bounding boxes, outperforming state-of-the-art models (e.g., nnUnet) and achieving radiologist-level accuracy in RECIST 1.1 measurements. The key advantage of this foundation model is its ability to surpass state-of-the-art performance while keeping the radiologist in the loop, a capability that previous models could not achieve. When radiologists interactively refine the segmentations, accuracy improves further. ONCOPILOT also accelerates measurement processes and reduces inter-reader variability, facilitating volumetric analysis and unlocking new biomarkers for deeper insights. This AI assistant is expected to enhance the precision of RECIST 1.1 measurements, unlock the potential of volumetric biomarkers, and improve patient stratification and clinical care, while seamlessly integrating into the radiological workflow.</p></details> |  |
| **[Task-Specific Adaptation of Segmentation Foundation Model via Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09199v2)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, foundation models trained on massive datasets to adapt to a wide range of tasks have attracted considerable attention and are actively being explored within the computer vision community. Among these, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) stands out for its remarkable progress in generalizability and flexibility for image segmentation tasks, achieved through prompt-based object mask generation. However, despite its strength, SAM faces two key limitations when applied to instance segmentation that segments specific objects or those in unique environments (e.g., task-specific adaptation for out-of-distribution objects) not typically present in the training data: 1) the ambiguity inherent in input prompts and 2) the necessity for extensive additional training to achieve optimal segmentation. To address these challenges, we propose a task-specific adaptation (i.e., customization) of the segmentation foundation model via prompt learning tailored to SAM. Our method involves a prompt learning module (PLM), which adjusts input prompts into the embedding space to better align with peculiarities of the target task, thereby enabling more efficient training. Furthermore, we introduce a point matching module (PMM) to enhance the feature representation for finer segmentation by ensuring detailed alignment with ground truth boundaries. Experimental results on various customized segmentation scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Works...</summary><p>Workshop on OOD Generalization in Computer Vision, ECCV 2024</p></details> |

BPM is the practice of documenting, measuring, improving, and automating enterprise workflows. However, research has focused almost exclusively on one task - full end-to-end automation using agents based on multimodal foundation models (FMs) like GPT-4. This focus on automation ignores the reality of how most BPM tools are applied today - simply documenting the relevant workflow takes 60% of the time of the typical process optimization project. To address this gap we present WONDERBREAD, the first benchmark for evaluating multimodal FMs on BPM tasks beyond automation. Our contributions are: (1) a dataset containing 2928 documented workflow demonstrations; (2) 6 novel BPM tasks sourced from real-world applications ranging from workflow documentation to knowledge transfer to process improvement; and (3) an automated evaluation harness. Our benchmark shows that while state-of-the-art FMs can automatically generate documentation (e.g. recalling 88% of the steps taken in a video demonstration of a workflow), they struggle to re-apply that knowledge towards finer-grained validation of workflow completion (F1 < 0.3). We hope WONDERBREAD encourages the development of more "human-centered" AI tooling for enterprise applications and furthers the exploration of multimodal FMs for the broader universe of BPM tasks. We publish our dataset and experiments here: https://github.com/HazyResearch/wonderbread</p></details> |  |

Current deep learning approaches for MILP focus on specific problem classes and do not generalize to unseen classes. To address this shortcoming, we take a foundation model training approach, where we train a single deep learning model on a diverse set of MILP problems to generalize across problem classes. As existing datasets for MILP lack diversity and volume, we introduce MILP-Evolve, a novel LLM-based evolutionary framework that is capable of generating a large set of diverse MILP classes with an unlimited amount of instances. We study our methodology on three key learning tasks that capture diverse aspects of MILP: (1) integrality gap prediction, (2) learning to branch, and (3) a new task of aligning MILP instances with natural language descriptions. Our empirical results show that models trained on the data generated by MILP-Evolve achieve significant improvements on unseen problems, including MIPLIB benchmarks. Our work highlights the potential of moving towards a foundation model approach for MILP that can generalize to a broad range of MILP applications. We are committed to fully open-sourcing our work to advance further research.</p></details> |  |

Conventional panoptic mapping methods, however, are limited by predefined semantic classes, thus making them ineffective for handling novel or unforeseen objects. In response to this limitation, we introduce the Unified Promptable Panoptic Mapping (UPPM) method. UPPM utilizes recent advances in foundation models to enable real-time, on-demand label generation using natural language prompts. By incorporating a dynamic labeling strategy into traditional panoptic mapping techniques, UPPM provides significant improvements in adaptability and versatility while maintaining high performance levels in map reconstruction. We demonstrate our approach on real-world and simulated datasets. Results show that UPPM can accurately reconstruct scenes and segment objects while generating rich semantic labels through natural language interactions. A series of ablation experiments validated the advantages of foundation model-based labeling over fixed label sets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under consideration at Pattern Recognition Letters</p></details> |

Pre-training large models on time series data is challenging due to (1) the absence of a large and cohesive public time series repository, and (2) diverse time series characteristics which make multi-dataset training onerous. Additionally, (3) experimental benchmarks to evaluate these models, especially in scenarios with limited resources, time, and supervision, are still in their nascent stages. To address these challenges, we compile a large and diverse collection of public time series, called the Time series Pile, and systematically tackle time series-specific challenges to unlock large-scale multi-dataset pre-training. Finally, we build on recent work to design a benchmark to evaluate time series foundation models on diverse tasks and datasets in limited supervision settings.

In this paper, we present the Robotics Diffusion Transformer (RDT), a pioneering diffusion foundation model for bimanual manipulation. RDT builds on diffusion models to effectively represent multi-modality, with innovative designs of a scalable Transformer to deal with the heterogeneity of multi-modal inputs and to capture the nonlinearity and high frequency of robotic data. To address data scarcity, we further introduce a Physically Interpretable Unified Action Space, which can unify the action representations of various robots while preserving the physical meanings of original actions, facilitating learning transferrable physical knowledge. With these designs, we managed to pre-train RDT on the largest collection of multi-robot datasets to date and scaled it up to 1.2B parameters, which is the largest diffusion-based foundation model for robotic manipulation. We finally fine-tuned RDT on a self-created multi-task bimanual dataset with over 6K+ episodes to refine its manipulation capabilities. Experiments on real robots demonstrate that RDT significantly outperforms existing methods. It exhibits zero-shot generalization to unseen objects and scenes, understands and follows language instructions, learns new skills with just 1~5 demonstrations, and effectively handles complex, dexterous tasks. We refer to https://rdt-robotics.github.io/rdt-robotics/ for the code and videos.</p></details> | 10 pages, conference |

In addition, saved checkpoints are dispatched to evaluation tasks or transferred across different training stages (e.g., from pre-training to post-training). All these scenarios require resharding distributed checkpoints from one parallelism to another. In production, different LFMs are trained with various frameworks and storage backends, depending on model sizes and training scales. A high-performance checkpointing system is needed to enable efficient checkpoint management at scale. This paper presents ByteCheckpoint, an industrial-grade checkpointing system for large-scale LFM training. ByteCheckpoint employs a parallelism-agnostic checkpoint representation that enables efficient load-time checkpoint resharding. ByteCheckpoint advocates a generic checkpoint saving/loading workflow to accommodate multiple training frameworks and support different storage backends. To ensure high I/O efficiency, we take a full-stack approach to optimize saving/loading plan generation, critical stages of checkpointing pipelines, and irregular tensor processing required by resharding. To guarantee the scalability of ByteCheckpoint in large-scale training, we enhance the storage system to efficiently handle high volumes of checkpointing I/O requests, devise communication optimizations within the checkpointing workflow, and introduce a suite of monitoring tools to analyze performance and detect bottlenecks. Compared to existing open-source checkpointing systems [40, 46], ByteCheckpoint significantly reduces runtime checkpoint stalls, achieving an average reduction of 54.20x. For saving and loading times, ByteCheckpoint achieves improvements of up to 9.96x and 8.80x, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, false negative samples, i.e., image-text pairs having the same semantics but incorrectly regarded as negatives, disrupt the visual-language pre-training process and affect the model's learning ability. This work aims to develop a retinal foundation model, called ViLReF, by pre-training on a paired dataset comprising 451,956 retinal images and corresponding diagnostic text reports. In our vision-language pre-training strategy, we leverage expert knowledge to facilitate the extraction of labels and propose a novel constraint, the Weighted Similarity Coupling Loss, to adjust the speed of pushing sample pairs further apart dynamically within the feature space. Furthermore, we employ a batch expansion module with dynamic memory queues, maintained by momentum encoders, to supply extra samples and compensate for the vacancies caused by eliminating false negatives. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple datasets for downstream classification and segmentation tasks. The experimental results demonstrate the powerful zero-shot and transfer learning capabilities of ViLReF, verifying the effectiveness of our pre-training strategy. Our ViLReF model is available at: https://github.com/T6Yang/ViLReF.</p></details> |  |

Foundation models, essential for narrative visualization, inherently facilitate this process through their superior ability to handle natural language queries and answers, generate cohesive narratives, and enhance visual communication.

| **[Audio Explanation Synthesis with Generative Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07530v1)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing success of audio foundation models across various tasks has led to a growing need for improved interpretability to understand their intricate decision-making processes better. Existing methods primarily focus on explaining these models by attributing importance to elements within the input space based on their influence on the final decision. In this paper, we introduce a novel audio explanation method that capitalises on the generative capacity of audio foundation models. Our method leverages the intrinsic representational power of the embedding space within these models by integrating established feature attribution techniques to identify significant features in this space. The method then generates listenable audio explanations by prioritising the most important features. Through rigorous benchmarking against standard datasets, including keyword spotting and speech emotion recognition, our model demonstrates its efficacy in producing audio explanations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalizing Segmentation Foundation Model Under Sim-to-real Domain-shift for Guidewire Segmentation in X-ray Fluoroscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07460v1)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Guidewire segmentation during endovascular interventions holds the potential to significantly enhance procedural accuracy, improving visualization and providing critical feedback that can support both physicians and robotic systems in navigating complex vascular pathways. Unlike supervised segmentation networks, which need many expensive expert-annotated labels, sim-to-real domain adaptation approaches utilize synthetic data from simulations, offering a cost-effective solution. The success of models like Segment-Anything (SAM) has driven advancements in image segmentation foundation models with strong zero/few-shot generalization through prompt engineering. However, they struggle with medical images like X-ray fluoroscopy and the domain-shifts of the data. Given the challenges of acquiring annotation and the accessibility of labeled simulation data, we propose a sim-to-real domain adaption framework with a coarse-to-fine strategy to adapt SAM to X-ray fluoroscopy guidewire segmentation without any annotation on the target domain. We first generate the pseudo-labels by utilizing a simple source image style transfer technique that preserves the guidewire structure. Then, we develop a weakly supervised self-training architecture to fine-tune an end-to-end student SAM with the coarse labels by imposing consistency regularization and supervision from the teacher SAM network. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on a publicly available Cardiac dataset and an in-house Neurovascular dataset, where our method surpasses both pre-trained SAM and many state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques by a large margin. Our code will be made public on GitHub soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Surgical Depth Anything: Depth Estimation for Surgical Scenes using Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07434v1)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular depth estimation is crucial for tracking and reconstruction algorithms, particularly in the context of surgical videos. However, the inherent challenges in directly obtaining ground truth depth maps during surgery render supervised learning approaches impractical. While many self-supervised methods based on Structure from Motion (SfM) have shown promising results, they rely heavily on high-quality camera motion and require optimization on a per-patient basis. These limitations can be mitigated by leveraging the current state-of-the-art foundational model for depth estimation, Depth Anything. However, when directly applied to surgical scenes, Depth Anything struggles with issues such as blurring, bleeding, and reflections, resulting in suboptimal performance. This paper presents a fine-tuning of the Depth Anything model specifically for the surgical domain, aiming to deliver more accurate pixel-wise depth maps tailored to the unique requirements and challenges of surgical environments. Our fine-tuning approach significantly improves the model's performance in surgical scenes, reducing errors related to blurring and reflections, and achieving a more reliable and precise depth estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Efficient Foundational Multi-modal Models for Video Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07405v1)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundational models are able to generate text outputs given prompt instructions and text, audio, or image inputs. Recently these models have been combined to perform tasks on video, such as video summarization. Such video foundation models perform pre-training by aligning outputs from each modality-specific model into the same embedding space. Then the embeddings from each model are used within a language model, which is fine-tuned on a desired instruction set. Aligning each modality during pre-training is computationally expensive and prevents rapid testing of different base modality models. During fine-tuning, evaluation is carried out within in-domain videos where it is hard to understand the generalizability and data efficiency of these methods. To alleviate these issues we propose a plug-and-play video language model. It directly uses the texts generated from each input modality into the language model, avoiding pre-training alignment overhead. Instead of fine-tuning we leverage few-shot instruction adaptation strategies. We compare the performance versus the computational costs for our plug-and-play style method and baseline tuning methods. Finally, we explore the generalizability of each method during domain shift and present insights on what data is useful when training data is limited. Through this analysis, we present practical insights on how to leverage multi-modal foundational models for effective results given realistic compute and data limitations.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

The recent rise of foundation models, such as CLIP, offers an opportunity to leverage pretrained, semantically rich embeddings that encapsulate broad and reusable knowledge. In this work we explore the potential of these foundation models not just to drive exploration, but also to analyze the critical role of the episodic novelty term in enhancing exploration effectiveness of the agent. We also investigate whether providing the intrinsic module with complete state information -- rather than just partial observations -- can improve exploration, despite the difficulties in handling small variations within large state spaces. Our experiments in the MiniGrid domain reveal that intrinsic modules can effectively utilize full state information, significantly increasing sample efficiency while learning an optimal policy. Moreover, we show that the embeddings provided by foundation models are sometimes even better than those constructed by the agent during training, further accelerating the learning process, especially when coupled with the episodic novelty term to enhance exploration.</p></details> |  |

Our core idea is that a foundation model for VRPs should be able to represent variants by treating each as a subset of a generalized problem equipped with different attributes. We propose a unified VRP environment capable of efficiently handling any attribute combination. The RouteFinder model leverages a modern transformer-based encoder and global attribute embeddings to improve task representation. Additionally, we introduce two reinforcement learning techniques to enhance multi-task performance: mixed batch training, which enables training on different variants at once, and multi-variant reward normalization to balance different reward scales. Finally, we propose efficient adapter layers that enable fine-tuning for new variants with unseen attributes. Extensive experiments on 24 VRP variants show RouteFinder achieves competitive results. Our code is openly available at https://github.com/ai4co/routefinder.</p></details> | <details><summary>A ver...</summary><p>A version of this work has been presented as an Oral at the ICML 2024 FM-Wild Workshop</p></details> |

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as promising techniques for encoding structural information and improving performance in tasks like link prediction and node classification. However, a key challenge remains: the difficulty of generalizing to unseen graph data with different properties. In this work, we propose a novel graph foundation model, called OpenGraph, to address this challenge. Our approach tackles several technical obstacles. Firstly, we enhance data augmentation using a large language model (LLM) to overcome data scarcity in real-world scenarios. Secondly, we introduce a unified graph tokenizer that enables the model to generalize effectively to diverse graph data, even when encountering unseen properties during training. Thirdly, our developed scalable graph transformer captures node-wise dependencies within the global topological context. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework. By adapting OpenGraph to new graph characteristics and comprehending diverse graphs, our approach achieves remarkable zero-shot graph learning performance across various settings.

They are intended to be general-purpose feature extractors, promising to achieve good performance on a range of downstream tasks. Real-world pathology image data does however exhibit considerable variability. Foundation models should be robust to these variations and other distribution shifts which might be encountered in practice. We evaluate two computational pathology foundation models: UNI (trained on more than 100,000 whole-slide images) and CONCH (trained on more than 1.1 million image-caption pairs), by utilizing them as feature extractors within prostate cancer grading models. We find that while UNI and CONCH perform well relative to baselines, the absolute performance can still be far from satisfactory in certain settings. The fact that foundation models have been trained on large and varied datasets does not guarantee that downstream models always will be robust to common distribution shifts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, work in progress</p></details> |
| **[FreeAvatar: Robust 3D Facial Animation Transfer by Learning an Expression Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13180v2)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-driven 3D facial animation transfer aims to drive avatars to reproduce the expressions of actors. Existing methods have achieved remarkable results by constraining both geometric and perceptual consistency. However, geometric constraints (like those designed on facial landmarks) are insufficient to capture subtle emotions, while expression features trained on classification tasks lack fine granularity for complex emotions. To address this, we propose \textbf{FreeAvatar}, a robust facial animation transfer method that relies solely on our learned expression representation. Specifically, FreeAvatar consists of two main components: the expression foundation model and the facial animation transfer model. In the first component, we initially construct a facial feature space through a face reconstruction task and then optimize the expression feature space by exploring the similarities among different expressions. Benefiting from training on the amounts of unlabeled facial images and re-collected expression comparison dataset, our model adapts freely and effectively to any in-the-wild input facial images. In the facial animation transfer component, we propose a novel Expression-driven Multi-avatar Animator, which first maps expressive semantics to the facial control parameters of 3D avatars and then imposes perceptual constraints between the input and output images to maintain expression consistency. To make the entire process differentiable, we employ a trained neural renderer to translate rig parameters into corresponding images. Furthermore, unlike previous methods that require separate decoders for each avatar, we propose a dynamic identity injection module that allows for the joint training of multiple avatars within a single network.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |

Although typically trained on large public datasets, FMs are often fine-tuned or integrated into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, which rely on private data. This access, along with their size and costly training, heightens the risk of intellectual property theft. Moreover, multimodal FMs may expose sensitive information. In this work, we examine the FM threat model and discuss the practicality and comprehensiveness of various approaches for securing against them, such as ML-based methods and trusted execution environments (TEEs). We demonstrate that TEEs offer an effective balance between strong security properties, usability, and performance. Specifically, we present a solution achieving less than 10\% overhead versus bare metal for the full Llama2 7B and 13B inference pipelines running inside \intel\ SGX and \intel\ TDX. We also share our configuration files and insights from our implementation. To our knowledge, our work is the first to show the practicality of TEEs for securing FMs.</p></details> |  |

Previous methods focus on using diffusion models as expressive decoders robust to quantization errors in the conditioning signals, yet achieving competitive results in this manner requires costly training of the diffusion model and long inference times due to the iterative generative process. In this work we formulate the removal of quantization error as a denoising task, using diffusion to recover lost information in the transmitted image latent. Our approach allows us to perform less than 10% of the full diffusion generative process and requires no architectural changes to the diffusion model, enabling the use of foundation models as a strong prior without additional fine tuning of the backbone. Our proposed codec outperforms previous methods in quantitative realism metrics, and we verify that our reconstructions are qualitatively preferred by end users, even when other methods use twice the bitrate.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ECCV 2024.

Analogous to the activation of two brain regions responsible for semantic and geometric reasoning during cognitive processes, modeling the intricate relationship between objects, tasks, and grasps necessitates rich semantic and geometric prior knowledge about these elements. Existing methods typically restrict the prior knowledge to a closed-set scope, limiting their generalization to novel objects and tasks out of the training set. To address such a limitation, we propose FoundationGrasp, a foundation model-based TOG framework that leverages the open-ended knowledge from foundation models to learn generalizable TOG skills. Extensive experiments are conducted on the contributed Language and Vision Augmented TaskGrasp (LaViA-TaskGrasp) dataset, demonstrating the superiority of FoundationGrasp over existing methods when generalizing to novel object instances, object classes, and tasks out of the training set. Furthermore, the effectiveness of FoundationGrasp is validated in real-robot grasping and manipulation experiments on a 7-DoF robotic arm. Our code, data, appendix, and video are publicly available at https://sites.google.com/view/foundationgrasp.</p></details> | 18 pages, 13 figures |

While recent efforts are focused on building such FMs by unlocking the potential of language models (LMs) for time series analysis, dedicated parameters for various downstream forecasting tasks need training, which hinders the common knowledge sharing across domains. Moreover, data owners may hesitate to share the access to local data due to privacy concerns and copyright protection, which makes it impossible to simply construct a FM on cross-domain training instances. To address these issues, we propose Time-FFM, a Federated Foundation Model for Time series forecasting by leveraging pretrained LMs. Specifically, we begin by transforming time series into the modality of text tokens. To bootstrap LMs for time series reasoning, we propose a prompt adaption module to determine domain-customized prompts dynamically instead of artificially. Given the data heterogeneity across domains, we design a personalized federated training strategy by learning global encoders and local prediction heads. Our comprehensive experiments indicate that Time-FFM outperforms state-of-the-arts and promises effective few-shot and zero-shot forecaster.</p></details> |  |
| **[netFound: Foundation Model for Network Security](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17025v3)** | 2024-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing generalizable ML-based solutions for disparate learning problems in network security is highly desired. However, despite a rich history of applying ML to network security, most existing solutions lack generalizability. This lack of progress can be attributed to an overreliance on supervised learning techniques and the associated challenges of curating well-specified labeled training data. This paper addresses a fundamental gap by introducing a novel transformer-based network foundation model, netFound. We employ self-supervised learning techniques on abundant, unlabeled network telemetry data for pre-training. This pretrained model can subsequently be fine-tuned to create generalizable learning artifacts for disparate learning tasks, even when using commonly available but challenging labeled datasets that are sparse, noisy, and skewed. To realize this goal, netFound leverages various domain-specific attributes and constraints unique to network data (packet traces) by developing multi-modal embeddings, protocol-aware tokenization, data-driven token composition, and hierarchical transformers. Our results demonstrate that netFound's domain-specific design choices ensure that it (1) effectively captures the hidden networking context in production settings, (2) outperforms four different SOTA methods on five different learning tasks, and (3) is robust to both noisy labels and learning shortcuts -- critical for developing generalizable ML models in practical settings.</p></details> |  |

Can we automate this process by deriving latent semantic structures in a document collection using foundation models? We introduce fPLSA, a foundation-model-based Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) method that iteratively clusters and tags document segments based on document-level contexts. These tags can be used to model the structure of given documents and for hierarchical sampling of new texts. Our experiments on story writing, math, and multi-step reasoning datasets demonstrate that fPLSA tags help reconstruct the original texts better than existing tagging methods. Moreover, when used for hierarchical sampling, fPLSA produces more diverse outputs with a higher likelihood of hitting the correct answer than direct sampling and hierarchical sampling with existing tagging methods.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a training-as-compressing perspective, wherein the model's weights embody a compressed representation of the training data. From a copyright standpoint, this point of view implies that the weights could be considered a reproduction or a derivative work of a potentially protected set of works. We investigate the technical and legal challenges that emerge from this framing of the copyright of outputs generated by foundation models, including their implications for practitioners and researchers.

The integration of the two has garnered significant attention from the AI research community. In this work, we attempt to provide an in-depth and comprehensive evaluation of the performance of MFM s on embodied task planning, aiming to shed light on their capabilities and limitations in this domain. To this end, based on the characteristics of embodied task planning, we first develop a systematic evaluation framework, which encapsulates four crucial capabilities of MFMs: object understanding, spatio-temporal perception, task understanding, and embodied reasoning. Following this, we propose a new benchmark, named MFE-ETP, characterized its complex and variable task scenarios, typical yet diverse task types, task instances of varying difficulties, and rich test case types ranging from multiple embodied question answering to embodied task reasoning. Finally, we offer a simple and easy-to-use automatic evaluation platform that enables the automated testing of multiple MFMs on the proposed benchmark. Using the benchmark and evaluation platform, we evaluated several state-of-the-art MFMs and found that they significantly lag behind human-level performance. The MFE-ETP is a high-quality, large-scale, and challenging benchmark relevant to real-world tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, the capabilities and limitations associated with these models remain poorly understood due to the absence of a unified evaluation framework. To fill this gap, we introduce ProteinBench, a holistic evaluation framework designed to enhance the transparency of protein foundation models. Our approach consists of three key components: (i) A taxonomic classification of tasks that broadly encompass the main challenges in the protein domain, based on the relationships between different protein modalities; (ii) A multi-metric evaluation approach that assesses performance across four key dimensions: quality, novelty, diversity, and robustness; and (iii) In-depth analyses from various user objectives, providing a holistic view of model performance. Our comprehensive evaluation of protein foundation models reveals several key findings that shed light on their current capabilities and limitations. To promote transparency and facilitate further research, we release the evaluation dataset, code, and a public leaderboard publicly for further analysis and a general modular toolkit. We intend for ProteinBench to be a living benchmark for establishing a standardized, in-depth evaluation framework for protein foundation models, driving their development and application while fostering collaboration within the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 2 figures and 15 tables</p></details> |

One of the fundamental limitations of the top-performing SAR ATR methods is that the learning paradigm is supervised, task-specific, limited-category, closed-world learning, which depends on massive amounts of accurately annotated samples that are expensively labeled by expert SAR analysts and has limited generalization capability and scalability. In this work, we make the first attempt towards building a foundation model for SAR ATR, termed SARatrX. SARatrX learns generalizable representations via self-supervised learning (SSL) and provides a basis for label-efficient model adaptation to generic SAR target detection and classification tasks. Specifically, SARatrX is trained on 0.18 M unlabelled SAR target samples, which are curated by combining contemporary benchmarks and constitute the largest publicly available dataset till now. Considering the characteristics of SAR images, a backbone tailored for SAR ATR is carefully designed, and a two-step SSL method endowed with multi-scale gradient features was applied to ensure the feature diversity and model scalability of SARatrX. The capabilities of SARatrX are evaluated on classification under few-shot and robustness settings and detection across various categories and scenes, and impressive performance is achieved, often competitive with or even superior to prior fully supervised, semi-supervised, or self-supervised algorithms. Our SARatrX and the curated dataset are released at https://github.com/waterdisappear/SARatrX to foster research into foundation models for SAR ATR and SAR image interpretation.</p></details> |  |

However, the deployment of foundation models in healthcare necessitates a rigorous examination of their trustworthiness, encompassing privacy, robustness, reliability, explainability, and fairness. The current body of survey literature on foundation models in medical imaging reveals considerable gaps, particularly in the area of trustworthiness. Additionally, existing surveys on the trustworthiness of foundation models do not adequately address their specific variations and applications within the medical imaging domain. This survey aims to fill that gap by presenting a novel taxonomy of foundation models used in medical imaging and analyzing the key motivations for ensuring their trustworthiness. We review current research on foundation models in major medical imaging applications, focusing on segmentation, medical report generation, medical question and answering (Q\&A), and disease diagnosis. These areas are highlighted because they have seen a relatively mature and substantial number of foundation models compared to other applications. We focus on literature that discusses trustworthiness in medical image analysis manuscripts. We explore the complex challenges of building trustworthy foundation models for each application, summarizing current concerns and strategies for enhancing trustworthiness. Furthermore, we examine the potential of these models to revolutionize patient care. Our analysis underscores the imperative for advancing towards trustworthy AI in medical image analysis, advocating for a balanced approach that fosters innovation while ensuring ethical and equitable healthcare delivery.</p></details> |  |

Advances in deep learning have enabled the development of state-of-the-art (SoTA) models for these tasks. However, model training is challenging due to data and label scarcity, especially in the less common imaging sequences. Moreover, each model is often trained for a specific task, with no connection between related tasks. In this work, we introduce a vision foundation model trained for CMR assessment, that is trained in a self-supervised fashion on 36 million CMR images. We then finetune the model in supervised way for 9 clinical tasks typical to a CMR workflow, across classification, segmentation, landmark localization, and pathology detection. We demonstrate improved accuracy and robustness across all tasks, over a range of available labeled dataset sizes. We also demonstrate improved few-shot learning with fewer labeled samples, a common challenge in medical image analyses. We achieve an out-of-box performance comparable to SoTA for most clinical tasks. The proposed method thus presents a resource-efficient, unified framework for CMR assessment, with the potential to accelerate the development of deep learning-based solutions for image analysis tasks, even with few annotated data available.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

The success of these models stems from their ability to mimic human capabilities, namely visual perception in vision models, and analytical reasoning in large language models. As visual perception and analysis are fundamental to data visualization, in this position paper we ask: how can we harness foundation models to advance progress in visualization design? Specifically, how can multimodal foundation models (MFMs) guide visualization design through visual perception? We approach these questions by investigating the effectiveness of MFMs for perceiving visualization, and formalizing the overall visualization design and optimization space. Specifically, we think that MFMs can best be viewed as judges, equipped with the ability to criticize visualizations, and provide us with actions on how to improve a visualization. We provide a deeper characterization for text-to-image generative models, and multi-modal large language models, organized by what these models provide as output, and how to utilize the output for guiding design decisions.

However, developing a general AI-ECG model has been challenging due to inter-individual variability and the diversity of ECG diagnoses, limiting existing models to specific diagnostic tasks and datasets. Moreover, current AI-ECG models struggle to achieve comparable performance between single-lead and 12-lead ECGs, limiting the application of AI-ECG to portable and wearable ECG devices. To address these limitations, we introduce an ECG Foundation Model (ECGFounder), a general-purpose model that leverages real-world ECG annotations from cardiology experts to broaden the diagnostic capabilities of ECG analysis. ECGFounder is trained on over 10 million ECGs with 150 label categories from the Harvard-Emory ECG Database, enabling comprehensive cardiovascular disease diagnosis through ECG analysis. The model is designed to be both effective out-of-the-box and fine-tunable for downstream tasks, maximizing usability. More importantly, we extend its application to single-lead ECGs, enabling complex condition diagnoses and supporting various downstream tasks in mobile and remote monitoring scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ECGFounder achieves expert-level performance on internal validation sets for both 12-lead and single-lead ECGs, while also exhibiting strong classification performance and generalization across various diagnoses on external validation sets. When fine-tuned, ECGFounder outperforms baseline models in demographics detection, clinical event detection, and cross-modality cardiac rhythm diagnosis. The trained model and data will be publicly released upon publication through the bdsp.io. Our code is available at https://github.com/bdsp-core/ECGFounder.</p></details> | working in progress |
| **[Variational Language Concepts for Interpreting Foundation Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03964v1)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation Language Models (FLMs) such as BERT and its variants have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing. To date, the interpretability of FLMs has primarily relied on the attention weights in their self-attention layers. However, these attention weights only provide word-level interpretations, failing to capture higher-level structures, and are therefore lacking in readability and intuitiveness. To address this challenge, we first provide a formal definition of conceptual interpretation and then propose a variational Bayesian framework, dubbed VAriational Language Concept (VALC), to go beyond word-level interpretations and provide concept-level interpretations. Our theoretical analysis shows that our VALC finds the optimal language concepts to interpret FLM predictions. Empirical results on several real-world datasets show that our method can successfully provide conceptual interpretation for FLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2024 findings</p></details> |

Recent advancements in multimodal foundation models have enabled unprecedentedly long context windows, presenting an opportunity to explore their capability to perform ICL with many more demonstrating examples. In this work, we evaluate the performance of multimodal foundation models scaling from few-shot to many-shot ICL. We benchmark GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro across 14 datasets spanning multiple domains (natural imagery, medical imagery, remote sensing, and molecular imagery) and tasks (image classification, visual QA, and object localization). We observe that many-shot ICL, including up to almost 2,000 demonstrating examples, leads to substantial improvements compared to few-shot (<100 examples) ICL across all of the datasets. Further, Gemini 1.5 Pro performance continues to improve log-linearly up to the maximum number of tested examples on many datasets. We also find open-weights multimodal foundation models like Llama 3.2-Vision do not benefit from the demonstrating examples, highlighting an important gap between open and closed multimodal foundation models. Given the high inference costs required for many-shot ICL, we also explore the impact of batching multiple queries in a single API call. We show that batching up to 50 queries can lead to performance improvements under zero-shot and many-shot ICL, with substantial gains in the zero-shot setting on multiple datasets, while drastically reducing per-query cost and latency. Finally, while GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro achieve similar zero-shot performance across the datasets, Gemini 1.5 Pro learns more quickly than GPT-4o on most datasets. Our results suggest that many-shot ICL could enable users to efficiently adapt multimodal foundation models to new applications and domains.

By leveraging content-style decomposition within an information-theoretic framework, our method enhances the latent representations of pre-trained vision foundation models, aligning them more effectively with specific task objectives and addressing the problem of distribution shift. We evaluate our approach on multiple datasets, including MNIST, its augmented variations (with yellow and white stripes), CIFAR-10, SVHN, and GalaxyMNIST. The experiments show improvements over supervised finetuning baseline of pre-trained models, particularly in low-labeled data regimes, across both frozen and trainable backbones for the majority of the tested datasets.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Repurposing Foundation Model for Generalizable Medical Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03794v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical time series (MedTS) classification is critical for a wide range of healthcare applications such as Alzheimer's Disease diagnosis. However, its real-world deployment is severely challenged by poor generalizability due to inter- and intra-dataset heterogeneity in MedTS, including variations in channel configurations, time series lengths, and diagnostic tasks. Here, we propose FORMED, a foundation classification model that leverages a pre-trained backbone and tackles these challenges through re-purposing. FORMED integrates the general representation learning enabled by the backbone foundation model and the medical domain knowledge gained on a curated cohort of MedTS datasets. FORMED can adapt seamlessly to unseen MedTS datasets, regardless of the number of channels, sample lengths, or medical tasks. Experimental results show that, without any task-specific adaptation, the repurposed FORMED achieves performance that is competitive with, and often superior to, 11 baseline models trained specifically for each dataset. Furthermore, FORMED can effectively adapt to entirely new, unseen datasets, with lightweight parameter updates, consistently outperforming baselines. Our results highlight FORMED as a versatile and scalable model for a wide range of MedTS classification tasks, positioning it as a strong foundation model for future research in MedTS analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisit Large-Scale Image-Caption Data in Pre-training Multimodal Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02740v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in multimodal models highlight the value of rewritten captions for improving performance, yet key challenges remain. For example, while synthetic captions often provide superior quality and image-text alignment, it is not clear whether they can fully replace AltTexts: the role of synthetic captions and their interaction with original web-crawled AltTexts in pre-training is still not well understood. Moreover, different multimodal foundation models may have unique preferences for specific caption formats, but efforts to identify the optimal captions for each model remain limited. In this work, we propose a novel, controllable, and scalable captioning pipeline designed to generate diverse caption formats tailored to various multimodal models. By examining Short Synthetic Captions (SSC) towards Dense Synthetic Captions (DSC+) as case studies, we systematically explore their effects and interactions with AltTexts across models such as CLIP, multimodal LLMs, and diffusion models. Our findings reveal that a hybrid approach that keeps both synthetic captions and AltTexts can outperform the use of synthetic captions alone, improving both alignment and performance, with each model demonstrating preferences for particular caption formats. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights into optimizing captioning strategies, thereby advancing the pre-training of multimodal foundation models.</p></details> | CV/ML |

However, current transfer learning strategies devoted to full fine-tuning for transfer learning may require significant resources and yield sub-optimal results when the labeled data of the target task is scarce. This makes its applicability in real clinical settings challenging since these institutions are usually constrained on data and computational resources to develop proprietary solutions. To address this challenge, we formalize Few-Shot Efficient Fine-Tuning (FSEFT), a novel and realistic scenario for adapting medical image segmentation foundation models. This setting considers the key role of both data- and parameter- efficiency during adaptation. Building on a foundation model pre-trained on open-access CT organ segmentation sources, we propose leveraging Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning and black-box Adapters to address such challenges. Furthermore, novel efficient adaptation methodologies are introduced in this work, which include Spatial black-box Adapters that are more appropriate for dense prediction tasks and constrained transductive inference, leveraging task-specific prior knowledge. Our comprehensive transfer learning experiments confirm the suitability of foundation models in medical image segmentation and unveil the limitations of popular fine-tuning strategies in few-shot scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal Extension of MICCAI - MedAGI Workshop 2023.

Deep learning models have advanced ETS modeling by effectively capturing sequence dependence. Nevertheless, learning a generic representation of ETS data for various applications remains challenging due to the inherently complex hierarchical structure of ETS data. Moreover, ETS data exhibits intricate temporal dependencies and is suscepti ble to the influence of exogenous variables. Furthermore, different instances exhibit diverse electricity consumption behavior. In this paper, we propose a foundation model PowerPM to model ETS data, providing a large-scale, off-the-shelf model for power systems. PowerPM consists of a temporal encoder and a hierarchical encoder. The temporal encoder captures both temporal dependencies in ETS data, considering exogenous variables. The hierarchical encoder models the correlation between hierarchy. Furthermore, PowerPM leverages a novel self-supervised pretraining framework consisting of masked ETS modeling and dual-view contrastive learning, which enable PowerPM to capture temporal dependency within ETS windows and aware the discrepancy across ETS windows, providing two different perspectives to learn generic representation. Our experiments involve five real world scenario datasets, comprising private and public data. Through pre-training on massive ETS data, PowerPM achieves SOTA performance on diverse downstream tasks within the private dataset. Impressively, when transferred to the public datasets, PowerPM maintains its superiority, showcasing its remarkable generalization ability across various tasks and domains. Moreover, ablation studies, few-shot experiments provide additional evidence of the effectiveness of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

LOFF-TA involves training a compact classifier on cached feature embeddings from a frozen foundation model, resulting in up to $37\times$ faster training and up to $26\times$ reduced GPU memory usage. Because the embeddings of augmented images would be too numerous to store, yet the augmentation process is essential for training, we propose to apply tensor augmentations to the cached embeddings of the original non-augmented images. LOFF-TA makes it possible to leverage the power of foundation models, regardless of their size, in settings with limited computational capacity. Moreover, LOFF-TA can be used to apply foundation models to high-resolution images without increasing compute. In certain scenarios, we find that training with LOFF-TA yields better results than directly fine-tuning the foundation model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |

However, the proliferation of FMs brings forth a critical challenge: the potential to generate hallucinated outputs, particularly in high-stakes applications. The tendency of foundation models to produce hallucinated content arguably represents the biggest hindrance to their widespread adoption in real-world scenarios, especially in domains where reliability and accuracy are paramount. This survey paper presents a comprehensive overview of recent developments that aim to identify and mitigate the problem of hallucination in FMs, spanning text, image, video, and audio modalities. By synthesizing recent advancements in detecting and mitigating hallucination across various modalities, the paper aims to provide valuable insights for researchers, developers, and practitioners. Essentially, it establishes a clear framework encompassing definition, taxonomy, and detection strategies for addressing hallucination in multimodal foundation models, laying the foundation for future research in this pivotal area.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 Findings |

However, this problem is not only self-contradictory but likely unsolvable. Unfortunately, current control-based strategies for solving it inevitably embed dangerous representations of distrust. If superintelligence can't trust humanity, then we can't fully trust it to reliably follow safety controls it can likely bypass. Not only will intended permanent control fail to keep us safe, but it may even trigger the extinction event many fear. A logical rationale is therefore presented that advocates a strategic pivot from control-induced distrust to foundational AI alignment modeling instinct-based representations of familial mutual trust. With current AI already representing distrust of human intentions, the Supertrust meta-strategy is proposed to prevent long-term foundational misalignment and ensure superintelligence is instead driven by intrinsic trust-based patterns, leading to safe and protective coexistence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lotus: Diffusion-based Visual Foundation Model for High-quality Dense Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18124v2)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging the visual priors of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models offers a promising solution to enhance zero-shot generalization in dense prediction tasks. However, existing methods often uncritically use the original diffusion formulation, which may not be optimal due to the fundamental differences between dense prediction and image generation. In this paper, we provide a systemic analysis of the diffusion formulation for the dense prediction, focusing on both quality and efficiency. And we find that the original parameterization type for image generation, which learns to predict noise, is harmful for dense prediction; the multi-step noising/denoising diffusion process is also unnecessary and challenging to optimize. Based on these insights, we introduce Lotus, a diffusion-based visual foundation model with a simple yet effective adaptation protocol for dense prediction. Specifically, Lotus is trained to directly predict annotations instead of noise, thereby avoiding harmful variance. We also reformulate the diffusion process into a single-step procedure, simplifying optimization and significantly boosting inference speed. Additionally, we introduce a novel tuning strategy called detail preserver, which achieves more accurate and fine-grained predictions. Without scaling up the training data or model capacity, Lotus achieves SoTA performance in zero-shot depth and normal estimation across various datasets. It also enhances efficiency, being significantly faster than most existing diffusion-based methods. Lotus' superior quality and efficiency also enable a wide range of practical applications, such as joint estimation, single/multi-view 3D reconstruction, etc. Project page: https://lotus3d.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally.

The code of nature, hidden in diverse genomes since the very beginning of life's evolution, holds immense potential for impacting humans and ecosystems through genome modeling. Recent breakthroughs in GFMs, such as Evo, have attracted significant investment and attention to genomic modeling, as they address long-standing challenges and transform in-silico genomic studies into automated, reliable, and efficient paradigms. In the context of this flourishing era of consecutive technological revolutions in genomics, GFM studies face two major challenges: the lack of GFM benchmarking tools and the absence of open-source software for diverse genomics. These challenges hinder the rapid evolution of GFMs and their wide application in tasks such as understanding and synthesizing genomes, problems that have persisted for decades. To address these challenges, we introduce GFMBench, a framework dedicated to GFM-oriented benchmarking. GFMBench standardizes benchmark suites and automates benchmarking for a wide range of open-source GFMs. It integrates millions of genomic sequences across hundreds of genomic tasks from four large-scale benchmarks, democratizing GFMs for a wide range of in-silico genomic applications. Additionally, GFMBench is released as open-source software, offering user-friendly interfaces and diverse tutorials, applicable for AutoBench and complex tasks like RNA design and structure prediction. To facilitate further advancements in genome modeling, we have launched a public leaderboard showcasing the benchmark performance derived from AutoBench.

However, with the reduction of imaging standards, the image quality has also been reduced, extremely limiting the clinical acceptability. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of deep learning for the NICT enhancement in specific scenarios, their high data cost and limited generalizability have become large obstacles. The recent research on the foundation model has brought new opportunities for building a universal NICT enhancement model - bridging the image quality degradation with minimal data cost. However, owing to the challenges in the collection of large pre-training datasets and the compatibility of data variation, no success has been reported. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale integrated Transformer AMPlifier (TAMP), the first imaging foundation model for universal NICT enhancement. It has been pre-trained on a large-scale physical-driven simulation dataset with 3.6 million NICT-ICT image pairs, and is able to directly generalize to the NICT enhancement tasks with various non-ideal settings and body regions. Via the adaptation with few data, it can further achieve professional performance in real-world specific scenarios. Our extensive experiments have demonstrated that the proposed TAMP has significant potential for promoting the exploration and application of NICT and serving a wider range of medical scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Moshi: a speech-text foundation model for real-time dialogue](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00037v2)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Moshi, a speech-text foundation model and full-duplex spoken dialogue framework. Current systems for spoken dialogue rely on pipelines of independent components, namely voice activity detection, speech recognition, textual dialogue and text-to-speech. Such frameworks cannot emulate the experience of real conversations. First, their complexity induces a latency of several seconds between interactions. Second, text being the intermediate modality for dialogue, non-linguistic information that modifies meaning -- such as emotion or non-speech sounds -- is lost in the interaction. Finally, they rely on a segmentation into speaker turns, which does not take into account overlapping speech, interruptions and interjections. Moshi solves these independent issues altogether by casting spoken dialogue as speech-to-speech generation. Starting from a text language model backbone, Moshi generates speech as tokens from the residual quantizer of a neural audio codec, while modeling separately its own speech and that of the user into parallel streams. This allows for the removal of explicit speaker turns, and the modeling of arbitrary conversational dynamics. We moreover extend the hierarchical semantic-to-acoustic token generation of previous work to first predict time-aligned text tokens as a prefix to audio tokens. Not only this "Inner Monologue" method significantly improves the linguistic quality of generated speech, but we also illustrate how it can provide streaming speech recognition and text-to-speech. Our resulting model is the first real-time full-duplex spoken large language model, with a theoretical latency of 160ms, 200ms in practice, and is available at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/moshi.</p></details> |  |

However, despite the success of large-scale pre-training in language and vision domains, pre-trained time series models remain limited in scale and operate at a high cost, hindering the development of larger capable forecasting models in real-world applications. In response, we introduce Time-MoE, a scalable and unified architecture designed to pre-train larger, more capable forecasting foundation models while reducing inference costs. By leveraging a sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) design, Time-MoE enhances computational efficiency by activating only a subset of networks for each prediction, reducing computational load while maintaining high model capacity. This allows Time-MoE to scale effectively without a corresponding increase in inference costs. Time-MoE comprises a family of decoder-only transformer models that operate in an auto-regressive manner and support flexible forecasting horizons with varying input context lengths. We pre-trained these models on our newly introduced large-scale data Time-300B, which spans over 9 domains and encompassing over 300 billion time points. For the first time, we scaled a time series foundation model up to 2.4 billion parameters, achieving significantly improved forecasting precision. Our results validate the applicability of scaling laws for training tokens and model size in the context of time series forecasting. Compared to dense models with the same number of activated parameters or equivalent computation budgets, our models consistently outperform them by large margin. These advancements position Time-MoE as a state-of-the-art solution for tackling real-world time series forecasting challenges with superior capability, efficiency, and flexibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 10 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

We develop a method that leverages foundation models to refine predictions from existing driving perception models -- such as enhancing object classification accuracy -- while minimizing the frequency of using these resource-intensive models. The method quantitatively characterizes uncertainties in the perception model's predictions and engages the foundation model only when these uncertainties exceed a pre-specified threshold. Specifically, it characterizes uncertainty by calibrating the perception model's confidence scores into theoretical lower bounds on the probability of correct predictions using conformal prediction. Then, it sends images to the foundation model and queries for refining the predictions only if the theoretical bound of the perception model's outcome is below the threshold. Additionally, we propose a temporal inference mechanism that enhances prediction accuracy by integrating historical predictions, leading to tighter theoretical bounds. The method demonstrates a 10 to 15 percent improvement in prediction accuracy and reduces the number of queries to the foundation model by 50 percent, based on quantitative evaluations from driving datasets.</p></details> |  |

Feeding foundation models a regionally diverse food dataset of World Wide Dishes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09496v2)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are increasingly ubiquitous in our daily lives, used in everyday tasks such as text-image searches, interactions with chatbots, and content generation. As use increases, so does concern over the disparities in performance and fairness of these models for different people in different parts of the world. To assess these growing regional disparities, we present World Wide Dishes, a mixed text and image dataset consisting of 765 dishes, with dish names collected in 131 local languages. World Wide Dishes has been collected purely through human contribution and decentralised means, by creating a website widely distributed through social networks. Using the dataset, we demonstrate a novel means of operationalising capability and representational biases in foundation models such as language models and text-to-image generative models. We enrich these studies with a pilot community review to understand, from a first-person perspective, how these models generate images for people in five African countries and the United States. We find that these models generally do not produce quality text and image outputs of dishes specific to different regions. This is true even for the US, which is typically considered to be more well-resourced in training data - though the generation of US dishes does outperform that of the investigated African countries. The models demonstrate a propensity to produce outputs that are inaccurate as well as culturally misrepresentative, flattening, and insensitive. These failures in capability and representational bias have the potential to further reinforce stereotypes and disproportionately contribute to erasure based on region.

Drawing inspiration from advances in language modeling, RisingBALLER treats each football match as a unique sequence in which players serve as tokens, with their embeddings shaped by the specific context of the match. Through the use of masked player prediction (MPP) as a pre-training task, RisingBALLER learns foundational features for football player representations, similar to how language models learn semantic features for text representations. As a downstream task, I introduce next match statistics prediction (NMSP) to showcase the effectiveness of the learned player embeddings. The NMSP model surpasses a strong baseline commonly used for performance forecasting within the community. Furthermore, I conduct an in-depth analysis to demonstrate how the learned embeddings by RisingBALLER can be used in various football analytics tasks, such as producing meaningful positional features that capture the essence and variety of player roles beyond rigid x,y coordinates, team cohesion estimation, and similar player retrieval for more effective data-driven scouting. More than a simple machine learning model, RisingBALLER is a comprehensive framework designed to transform football data analytics by learning high-level foundational features for players, taking into account the context of each match. It offers a deeper understanding of football players beyond individual statistics.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures.

However, as a community, we have been constraining most robotic systems by designing them for specific tasks, training them on specific datasets, and deploying them within specific environments. These systems require extensively-labeled data and task-specific models. When deployed in real-world scenarios, such systems face several generalization issues and struggle to remain robust to distribution shifts. Motivated by the impressive open-set performance and content generation capabilities of web-scale, large-capacity pre-trained models (i.e., foundation models) in research fields such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), we devote this survey to exploring (i) how these existing foundation models from NLP and CV can be applied to the field of general-purpose robotics, and also exploring (ii) what a robotics-specific foundation model would look like. We begin by providing a generalized formulation of how foundation models are used in robotics, and the fundamental barriers to making generalist robots universally applicable. Next, we establish a taxonomy to discuss current work exploring ways to leverage existing foundation models for robotics and develop ones catered to robotics. Finally, we discuss key challenges and promising future directions in using foundation models for enabling general-purpose robotic systems. We encourage readers to view our living GitHub repository 2 of resources, including papers reviewed in this survey, as well as related projects and repositories for developing foundation models for robotics.</p></details> |  |

Fine-tuning (FT) is a method of customizing a pre-trained AI foundation model by further training it on a smaller, targeted dataset. In this paper, we initiate the study of the Privacy-Preserving Parameter-Efficient FT (P3EFT) framework, which can be viewed as the intersection of Parameter-Efficient FT (PEFT) and Privacy-Preserving FT (PPFT). PEFT modifies only a small subset of the model's parameters to achieve FT (i.e., adapting a pre-trained model to a specific dataset), while PPFT uses privacy-preserving technologies to protect the confidentiality of the model during the FT process. There have been many studies on PEFT or PPFT but very few on their fusion, which motivates our work on P3EFT to achieve both parameter efficiency and model privacy. To exemplify our P3EFT, we present the PrivTuner scheme, which incorporates Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enabled privacy protection into LoRA (short for ``Low-Rank Adapter''). Intuitively speaking, PrivTuner allows the model owner and the external data owners to collaboratively implement PEFT with encrypted data. After describing PrivTuner in detail, we further investigate its energy consumption and privacy protection. Then, we consider a PrivTuner system over wireless communications and formulate a joint optimization problem to adaptively minimize energy while maximizing privacy protection, with the optimization variables including FDMA bandwidth allocation, wireless transmission power, computational resource allocation, and privacy protection. A resource allocation algorithm is devised to solve the problem. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm can significantly reduce energy consumption while adapting to different privacy requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Foundation Model for Zero-shot Logical Query Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07198v2)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex logical query answering (CLQA) in knowledge graphs (KGs) goes beyond simple KG completion and aims at answering compositional queries comprised of multiple projections and logical operations. Existing CLQA methods that learn parameters bound to certain entity or relation vocabularies can only be applied to the graph they are trained on which requires substantial training time before being deployed on a new graph. Here we present UltraQuery, the first foundation model for inductive reasoning that can zero-shot answer logical queries on any KG. The core idea of UltraQuery is to derive both projections and logical operations as vocabulary-independent functions which generalize to new entities and relations in any KG. With the projection operation initialized from a pre-trained inductive KG reasoning model, UltraQuery can solve CLQA on any KG after finetuning on a single dataset. Experimenting on 23 datasets, UltraQuery in the zero-shot inference mode shows competitive or better query answering performance than best available baselines and sets a new state of the art on 15 of them.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |
| **[Comprehensive Performance Modeling and System Design Insights for Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00273v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI, in particular large transformer models, are increasingly driving HPC system design in science and industry. We analyze performance characteristics of such transformer models and discuss their sensitivity to the transformer type, parallelization strategy, and HPC system features (accelerators and interconnects). We utilize a performance model that allows us to explore this complex design space and highlight its key components. We find that different transformer types demand different parallelism and system characteristics at different training regimes. Large Language Models are performant with 3D parallelism and amplify network needs only at pre-training scales with reduced dependence on accelerator capacity and bandwidth. On the other hand, long-sequence transformers, representative of scientific foundation models, place a more uniform dependence on network and capacity with necessary 4D parallelism. Our analysis emphasizes the need for closer performance modeling of different transformer types keeping system features in mind and demonstrates a path towards this. Our code is available as open-source.</p></details> | 17 pages, PMBS 2024 |
| **[FMint: Bridging Human Designed and Data Pretrained Models for Differential Equation Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14688v3)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The fast simulation of dynamical systems is a key challenge in many scientific and engineering applications, such as weather forecasting, disease control, and drug discovery. With the recent success of deep learning, there is increasing interest in using neural networks to solve differential equations in a data-driven manner. However, existing methods are either limited to specific types of differential equations or require large amounts of data for training. This restricts their practicality in many real-world applications, where data is often scarce or expensive to obtain. To address this, we propose a novel multi-modal foundation model, named \textbf{FMint} (\textbf{F}oundation \textbf{M}odel based on \textbf{In}i\textbf{t}ialization), to bridge the gap between human-designed and data-driven models for the fast simulation of dynamical systems. Built on a decoder-only transformer architecture with in-context learning, FMint utilizes both numerical and textual data to learn a universal error correction scheme for dynamical systems, using prompted sequences of coarse solutions from traditional solvers. The model is pre-trained on a corpus of 40K ODEs, and we perform extensive experiments on challenging ODEs that exhibit chaotic behavior and of high dimensionality. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of both accuracy and efficiency compared to classical numerical solvers, highlighting FMint's potential as a general-purpose solver for dynamical systems. Our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of 1 to 2 orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art dynamical system simulators, and delivers a 5X speedup compared to traditional numerical algorithms. The code for FMint is available at \url{https://github.com/margotyjx/FMint}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Paving the way toward foundation models for irregular and unaligned Satellite Image Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08448v2)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although recently several foundation models for satellite remote sensing imagery have been proposed, they fail to address major challenges of real/operational applications. Indeed, embeddings that don't take into account the spectral, spatial and temporal dimensions of the data as well as the irregular or unaligned temporal sampling are of little use for most real world uses. As a consequence, we propose an ALIgned Sits Encoder (ALISE), a novel approach that leverages the spatial, spectral, and temporal dimensions of irregular and unaligned SITS while producing aligned latent representations. Unlike SSL models currently available for SITS, ALISE incorporates a flexible query mechanism to project the SITS into a common and learned temporal projection space. Additionally, thanks to a multi-view framework, we explore integration of instance discrimination along a masked autoencoding task to SITS. The quality of the produced representation is assessed through three downstream tasks: crop segmentation (PASTIS), land cover segmentation (MultiSenGE), and a novel crop change detection dataset. Furthermore, the change detection task is performed without supervision. The results suggest that the use of aligned representations is more effective than previous SSL methods for linear probing segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[OBSeg: Accurate and Fast Instance Segmentation Framework Using Segmentation Foundation Models with Oriented Bounding Box Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08174v6)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instance segmentation in remote sensing images is a long-standing challenge. Since horizontal bounding boxes introduce many interference objects, oriented bounding boxes (OBBs) are usually used for instance identification. However, based on ``segmentation within bounding box'' paradigm, current instance segmentation methods using OBBs are overly dependent on bounding box detection performance. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes OBSeg, an accurate and fast instance segmentation framework using OBBs. OBSeg is based on box prompt-based segmentation foundation models (BSMs), e.g., Segment Anything Model. Specifically, OBSeg first detects OBBs to distinguish instances and provide coarse localization information. Then, it predicts OBB prompt-related masks for fine segmentation. Since OBBs only serve as prompts, OBSeg alleviates the over-dependence on bounding box detection performance of current instance segmentation methods using OBBs. Thanks to OBB prompts, OBSeg outperforms other current BSM-based methods using HBBs. In addition, to enable BSMs to handle OBB prompts, we propose a novel OBB prompt encoder. To make OBSeg more lightweight and further improve the performance of lightweight distilled BSMs, a Gaussian smoothing-based knowledge distillation method is introduced. Experiments demonstrate that OBSeg outperforms current instance segmentation methods on multiple datasets in terms of instance segmentation accuracy and has competitive inference speed. The code is available at https://github.com/zhen6618/OBBInstanceSegmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Learning from Vision-Language Foundation Models: Theoretical Analysis and Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19610v1)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating pretrained vision-language foundation models like CLIP into federated learning has attracted significant attention for enhancing generalization across diverse tasks. Typically, federated learning of vision-language models employs prompt learning to reduce communication and computational costs, i.e., prompt-based federated learning. However, there is limited theoretical analysis to understand the performance of prompt-based federated learning. In this work, we construct a theoretical analysis framework for prompt-based federated learning via feature learning theory. Specifically, we monitor the evolution of signal learning and noise memorization in prompt-based federated learning, demonstrating that performance can be assessed by the ratio of task-relevant to task-irrelevant coefficients. Furthermore, we draw an analogy between income and risk in portfolio optimization and the task-relevant and task-irrelevant terms in feature learning. Leveraging inspiration from portfolio optimization that combining two independent assets will maintain the income while reducing the risk, we introduce two prompts: global prompt and local prompt to construct a prompt portfolio to balance the generalization and personalization. Consequently, we showed the performance advantage of the prompt portfolio and derived the optimal mixing coefficient. These theoretical claims have been further supported by empirical experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Stance Classification on Social Media Using Quantified Moral Foundations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09848v3)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study enhances stance detection on social media by incorporating deeper psychological attributes, specifically individuals' moral foundations. These theoretically-derived dimensions aim to provide a comprehensive profile of an individual's moral concerns which, in recent work, has been linked to behaviour in a range of domains, including society, politics, health, and the environment. In this paper, we investigate how moral foundation dimensions can contribute to predicting an individual's stance on a given target. Specifically we incorporate moral foundation features extracted from text, along with message semantic features, to classify stances at both message- and user-levels using both traditional machine learning models and large language models. Our preliminary results suggest that encoding moral foundations can enhance the performance of stance detection tasks and help illuminate the associations between specific moral foundations and online stances on target topics. The results highlight the importance of considering deeper psychological attributes in stance analysis and underscores the role of moral foundations in guiding online social behavior.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

However, variations in organs, tissue preparation methods, and image acquisition processes can lead to domain discrepancies among digital pathology images. To address this problem, in this paper, we use Rein, a fine-tuning method, to parametrically and efficiently fine-tune various vision foundation models (VFMs) for MICCAI 2024 Cross-Organ and Cross-Scanner Adenocarcinoma Segmentation (COSAS2024). The core of Rein consists of a set of learnable tokens, which are directly linked to instances, improving functionality at the instance level in each layer. In the data environment of the COSAS2024 Challenge, extensive experiments demonstrate that Rein fine-tuned the VFMs to achieve satisfactory results. Specifically, we used Rein to fine-tune ConvNeXt and DINOv2. Our team used the former to achieve scores of 0.7719 and 0.7557 on the preliminary test phase and final test phase in task1, respectively, while the latter achieved scores of 0.8848 and 0.8192 on the preliminary test phase and final test phase in task2.

| **[LoRKD: Low-Rank Knowledge Decomposition for Medical Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19540v1)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of large-scale pre-training techniques has significantly advanced the development of medical foundation models, enabling them to serve as versatile tools across a broad range of medical tasks. However, despite their strong generalization capabilities, medical foundation models pre-trained on large-scale datasets tend to suffer from domain gaps between heterogeneous data, leading to suboptimal performance on specific tasks compared to specialist models, as evidenced by previous studies. In this paper, we explore a new perspective called "Knowledge Decomposition" to improve the performance on specific medical tasks, which deconstructs the foundation model into multiple lightweight expert models, each dedicated to a particular anatomical region, with the aim of enhancing specialization and simultaneously reducing resource consumption. To accomplish the above objective, we propose a novel framework named Low-Rank Knowledge Decomposition (LoRKD), which explicitly separates gradients from different tasks by incorporating low-rank expert modules and efficient knowledge separation convolution. The low-rank expert modules resolve gradient conflicts between heterogeneous data from different anatomical regions, providing strong specialization at lower costs. The efficient knowledge separation convolution significantly improves algorithm efficiency by achieving knowledge separation within a single forward propagation. Extensive experimental results on segmentation and classification tasks demonstrate that our decomposed models not only achieve state-of-the-art performance but also exhibit superior transferability on downstream tasks, even surpassing the original foundation models in task-specific evaluations. The code is available at here.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is an extended version of our conference paper published on CVPR 2024.

This pioneering model achieves state-of-the-art performance in demographic prediction, disease diagnosis/prognosis, and trait prediction through fine-tuning. Furthermore, it excels in off-the-shelf evaluations (e.g., linear probing) and demonstrates superior generalizability across different ethnic groups, surpassing the previous large model for brain activity significantly. Brain-JEPA incorporates two innovative techniques: Brain Gradient Positioning and Spatiotemporal Masking. Brain Gradient Positioning introduces a functional coordinate system for brain functional parcellation, enhancing the positional encoding of different Regions of Interest (ROIs). Spatiotemporal Masking, tailored to the unique characteristics of fMRI data, addresses the challenge of heterogeneous time-series patches. These methodologies enhance model performance and advance our understanding of the neural circuits underlying cognition. Overall, Brain-JEPA is paving the way to address pivotal questions of building brain functional coordinate system and masking brain activity at the AI-neuroscience interface, and setting a potentially new paradigm in brain activity analysis through downstream adaptation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally.

Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly speech foundation models, have shown significant promise in detecting mental health states by capturing diverse features. This study investigates which pretext tasks in these models best transfer to mental health detection and examines how different model layers encode features relevant to mental health conditions. We also probed the optimal length of audio segments and the best pooling strategies to improve detection accuracy. Using the Callyope-GP and Androids datasets, we evaluated the models' effectiveness across different languages and speech tasks, aiming to enhance the generalizability of speech-based mental health diagnostics. Our approach achieved SOTA scores in depression detection on the Androids dataset.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Lens: A Foundation Model for Network Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03646v4)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network traffic refers to the amount of data being sent and received over the internet or any system that connects computers. Analyzing and understanding network traffic is vital for improving network security and management. However, the analysis of network traffic is challenging due to the diverse nature of data packets, which often feature heterogeneous headers and encrypted payloads lacking semantics. To capture the latent semantics of traffic, a few studies have adopted pre-training techniques based on the Transformer encoder or decoder to learn the representations from massive traffic data. However, these methods typically excel in traffic understanding (classification) or traffic generation tasks. To address this issue, we develop Lens, a foundation model for network traffic that leverages the T5 architecture to learn the pre-trained representations from large-scale unlabeled data. Harnessing the strength of the encoder-decoder framework, which captures the global information while preserving the generative ability, our model can better learn the representations from raw data. To further enhance pre-training effectiveness, we design a novel loss that combines three distinct tasks: Masked Span Prediction (MSP), Packet Order Prediction (POP), and Homologous Traffic Prediction (HTP). Evaluation results across various benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed Lens outperforms the baselines in most downstream tasks related to both traffic understanding and generation. Notably, it also requires much less labeled data for fine-tuning compared to current methods.</p></details> |  |

Analyzing the energy consumption in continual training of vision foundation models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18664v1)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the ever-growing adoption of AI, its impact on the environment is no longer negligible. Despite the potential that continual learning could have towards Green AI, its environmental sustainability remains relatively uncharted. In this work we aim to gain a systematic understanding of the energy efficiency of continual learning algorithms. To that end, we conducted an extensive set of empirical experiments comparing the energy consumption of recent representation-, prompt-, and exemplar-based continual learning algorithms and two standard baseline (fine tuning and joint training) when used to continually adapt a pre-trained ViT-B/16 foundation model. We performed our experiments on three standard datasets: CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, and DomainNet. Additionally, we propose a novel metric, the Energy NetScore, which we use measure the algorithm efficiency in terms of energy-accuracy trade-off. Through numerous evaluations varying the number and size of the incremental learning steps, our experiments demonstrate that different types of continual learning algorithms have very different impacts on energy consumption during both training and inference. Although often overlooked in the continual learning literature, we found that the energy consumed during the inference phase is crucial for evaluating the environmental sustainability of continual learning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted at the Green FOundation MOdels (GreenFOMO) ECCV 2024 Workshop</p></details> |

While the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MM-LLMs) propels advancements in artificial general intelligence through their versatile capabilities, they still lack true any-to-any understanding and generation. Recently, the release of GPT-4o has showcased the remarkable potential of any-to-any LLMs for complex real-world tasks, enabling omnidirectional input and output across images, speech, and text. However, it is closed-source and does not support the generation of multimodal interleaved sequences. To address this gap, we present MIO, which is trained on a mixture of discrete tokens across four modalities using causal multimodal modeling. MIO undergoes a four-stage training process: (1) alignment pre-training, (2) interleaved pre-training, (3) speech-enhanced pre-training, and (4) comprehensive supervised fine-tuning on diverse textual, visual, and speech tasks. Our experimental results indicate that MIO exhibits competitive, and in some cases superior, performance compared to previous dual-modal baselines, any-to-any model baselines, and even modality-specific baselines. Moreover, MIO demonstrates advanced capabilities inherent to its any-to-any feature, such as interleaved video-text generation, chain-of-visual-thought reasoning, visual guideline generation, instructional image editing, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report.

However, building a unified MLLM for multi-task learning in the medical field remains a thorny challenge. To mitigate the tug-of-war problem of multi-modal multi-task optimization, recent advances primarily focus on improving the LLM components, while neglecting the connector that bridges the gap between modalities. In this paper, we introduce Uni-Med, a novel medical generalist foundation model which consists of a universal visual feature extraction module, a connector mixture-of-experts (CMoE) module, and an LLM. Benefiting from the proposed CMoE that leverages a well-designed router with a mixture of projection experts at the connector, Uni-Med achieves efficient solution to the tug-of-war problem and can perform six different medical tasks including question answering, visual question answering, report generation, referring expression comprehension, referring expression generation and image classification. To the best of our knowledge, Uni-Med is the first effort to tackle multi-task interference at the connector. Extensive ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of introducing CMoE under any configuration, with up to an average 8% performance gains. We further provide interpretation analysis of the tug-of-war problem from the perspective of gradient optimization and parameter statistics. Compared to previous state-of-the-art medical MLLMs, Uni-Med achieves competitive or superior evaluation metrics on diverse tasks. Code, data and model will be soon available at GitHub.</p></details> |  |

By studying these spaces from a mathematical perspective, we expect to gain more insight into how to build better algorithms to solve decision problems. Therefore, we focus on presenting the connection between the Banach fixed point theorem and the convergence of reinforcement learning algorithms, and we illustrate how the insights gained from this can practically help in designing more efficient algorithms. Before doing so, however, we first introduce relevant concepts such as metric spaces, normed spaces and Banach spaces for better understanding, before expressing the entire reinforcement learning problem in terms of Markov decision processes. This allows us to properly introduce the Banach contraction principle in a language suitable for reinforcement learning, and to write the Bellman equations in terms of operators on Banach spaces to show why reinforcement learning algorithms converge. Finally, we show how the insights gained from the mathematical study of convergence are helpful in reasoning about the best ways to make reinforcement learning algorithms more efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>Super...</summary><p>Supervisor : Yae Ulrich Gaba , Mentor : Domini Jocema Leko</p></details> |
