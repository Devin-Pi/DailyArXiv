| **[Equipping Diffusion Models with Differentiable Spatial Entropy for Low-Light Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09735v1)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image restoration, which aims to recover high-quality images from their corrupted counterparts, often faces the challenge of being an ill-posed problem that allows multiple solutions for a single input. However, most deep learning based works simply employ l1 loss to train their network in a deterministic way, resulting in over-smoothed predictions with inferior perceptual quality. In this work, we propose a novel method that shifts the focus from a deterministic pixel-by-pixel comparison to a statistical perspective, emphasizing the learning of distributions rather than individual pixel values. The core idea is to introduce spatial entropy into the loss function to measure the distribution difference between predictions and targets. To make this spatial entropy differentiable, we employ kernel density estimation (KDE) to approximate the probabilities for specific intensity values of each pixel with their neighbor areas. Specifically, we equip the entropy with diffusion models and aim for superior accuracy and enhanced perceptual quality over l1 based noise matching loss. In the experiments, we evaluate the proposed method for low light enhancement on two datasets and the NTIRE challenge 2024. All these results illustrate the effectiveness of our statistic-based entropy loss. Code is available at https://github.com/shermanlian/spatial-entropy-loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPRW...</summary><p>CVPRW 2024, best LPIPS in the NTIRE low light enhancement challenge 2024</p></details> |
| **[RIS-Aided Receive Generalized Spatial Modulation Design with Reflecting Modulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15566v3)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial modulation (SM) transmits additional information bits by the selection of antennas. Generalized spatial modulation (GSM), as an advanced type of SM, can be divided into diversity and multiplexing (MUX) schemes according to the symbols carried on the selected antennas are identical or different. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted SM exhibits better reception performance compared to conventional SM. To overcome the limitations of SM, this paper combines GSM with RIS and proposes the RIS-aided receive generalized spatial modulation (RIS-RGSM) scheme. The RIS-RGSM diversity scheme is realized via a simple improvement based on the state-of-the-art scheme. To further increase the transmission rate, a novel RIS-RGSM MUX scheme is proposed, where the reflection phase shifts and on/off states of RIS elements are configured to achieve bit mapping. The theoretical bit error rate (BER) of the proposed scheme is derived and agrees well with the simulation results. Numerical simulations show that the RIS-RGSM MUX scheme has better BER performance than the diversity scheme. The proposed scheme can significantly increase the transmission rate and maintain good performance compared to the existing scheme under a limited number of antennas.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, submitted to Conference</p></details> |
| **[Monad: Towards Cost-effective Specialization for Chiplet-based Spatial Accelerators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11256v3)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced packaging offers a new design paradigm in the post-Moore era, where many small chiplets can be assembled into a large system. Based on heterogeneous integration, a chiplet-based accelerator can be highly specialized for a specific workload, demonstrating extreme efficiency and cost reduction. To fully leverage this potential, it is critical to explore both the architectural design space for individual chiplets and different integration options to assemble these chiplets, which have yet to be fully exploited by existing proposals. This paper proposes Monad, a cost-aware specialization approach for chiplet-based spatial accelerators that explores the tradeoffs between PPA and fabrication costs. To evaluate a specialized system, we introduce a modeling framework considering the non-uniformity in dataflow, pipelining, and communications when executing multiple tensor workloads on different chiplets. We propose to combine the architecture and integration design space by uniformly encoding the design aspects for both spaces and exploring them with a systematic ML-based approach. The experiments demonstrate that Monad can achieve an average of 16% and 30% EDP reduction compared with the state-of-the-art chiplet-based accelerators, Simba and NN-Baton, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ICCAD 2023</p></details> |
| **[Two-stage Spatial Regression Models for Spatial Confounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09358v1)** | 2024-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Public health data are often spatially dependent, but standard spatial regression methods can suffer from bias and invalid inference when the independent variable is associated with spatially-correlated residuals. This could occur if, for example, there is an unmeasured environmental contaminant. Geoadditive structural equation modeling (gSEM), in which an estimated spatial trend is removed from both the explanatory and response variables before estimating the parameters of interest, has previously been proposed as a solution, but there has been little investigation of gSEM's properties with point-referenced data. We link gSEM to results on double machine learning and semiparametric regression based on two-stage procedures. We propose using these semiparametric estimators for spatial regression using Gaussian processes with Mat\`ern covariance to estimate the spatial trends, and term this class of estimators Double Spatial Regression (DSR). We derive regularity conditions for root-$n$ asymptotic normality and consistency and closed-form variance estimation, and show that in simulations where standard spatial regression estimators are highly biased and have poor coverage, DSR can mitigate bias more effectively than competitors and obtain nominal coverage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-parametric estimation of the reaction term in semi-linear SPDEs with spatial ergodicity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05457v2)** | 2024-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper discusses the non-parametric estimation of a non-linear reaction term in a semi-linear parabolic stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). The estimator's consistency is due to the spatial ergodicity of the SPDE while the time horizon remains fixed. The analysis of the estimation error requires the concentration of spatial averages of non-linear transformations of the SPDE. The method developed in this paper combines the Clark-Ocone formula from Malliavin calculus with the Markovianity of the SPDE and density estimates. The resulting variance bound utilises the averaging effect of the conditional expectation in the Clark-Ocone formula. The method is applied to two realistic asymptotic regimes. The focus is on a coupling between the diffusivity and the noise level, where both tend to zero. Secondly, the observation of a fixed SPDE on a growing spatial observation window is considered. Furthermore, we prove the concentration of the occupation time around the occupation measure.</p></details> | 46 pages |
| **[Learning Spatial Features from Audio-Visual Correspondence in Egocentric Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04760v3)** | 2024-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a self-supervised method for learning representations based on spatial audio-visual correspondences in egocentric videos. Our method uses a masked auto-encoding framework to synthesize masked binaural (multi-channel) audio through the synergy of audio and vision, thereby learning useful spatial relationships between the two modalities. We use our pretrained features to tackle two downstream video tasks requiring spatial understanding in social scenarios: active speaker detection and spatial audio denoising. Through extensive experiments, we show that our features are generic enough to improve over multiple state-of-the-art baselines on both tasks on two challenging egocentric video datasets that offer binaural audio, EgoCom and EasyCom.

| **[PNeRV: Enhancing Spatial Consistency via Pyramidal Neural Representation for Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08921v1)** | 2024-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The primary focus of Neural Representation for Videos (NeRV) is to effectively model its spatiotemporal consistency. However, current NeRV systems often face a significant issue of spatial inconsistency, leading to decreased perceptual quality. To address this issue, we introduce the Pyramidal Neural Representation for Videos (PNeRV), which is built on a multi-scale information connection and comprises a lightweight rescaling operator, Kronecker Fully-connected layer (KFc), and a Benign Selective Memory (BSM) mechanism. The KFc, inspired by the tensor decomposition of the vanilla Fully-connected layer, facilitates low-cost rescaling and global correlation modeling. BSM merges high-level features with granular ones adaptively. Furthermore, we provide an analysis based on the Universal Approximation Theory of the NeRV system and validate the effectiveness of the proposed PNeRV.We conducted comprehensive experiments to demonstrate that PNeRV surpasses the performance of contemporary NeRV models, achieving the best results in video regression on UVG and DAVIS under various metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and FVD). Compared to vanilla NeRV, PNeRV achieves a +4.49 dB gain in PSNR and a 231% increase in FVD on UVG, along with a +3.28 dB PSNR and 634% FVD increase on DAVIS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Spatial Understanding of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14540v3)** | 2024-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) show remarkable capabilities across a variety of tasks. Despite the models only seeing text in training, several recent studies suggest that LLM representations implicitly capture aspects of the underlying grounded concepts. Here, we explore LLM representations of a particularly salient kind of grounded knowledge -- spatial relationships. We design natural-language navigation tasks and evaluate the ability of LLMs, in particular GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, and Llama2 series models, to represent and reason about spatial structures. These tasks reveal substantial variability in LLM performance across different spatial structures, including square, hexagonal, and triangular grids, rings, and trees. In extensive error analysis, we find that LLMs' mistakes reflect both spatial and non-spatial factors. These findings suggest that LLMs appear to capture certain aspects of spatial structure implicitly, but room for improvement remains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to TMLR 2024.

| **[Integrated Variational Fourier Features for Fast Spatial Modelling with Gaussian Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14142v2)** | 2024-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse variational approximations are popular methods for scaling up inference and learning in Gaussian processes to larger datasets. For $N$ training points, exact inference has $O(N^3)$ cost; with $M \ll N$ features, state of the art sparse variational methods have $O(NM^2)$ cost. Recently, methods have been proposed using more sophisticated features; these promise $O(M^3)$ cost, with good performance in low dimensional tasks such as spatial modelling, but they only work with a very limited class of kernels, excluding some of the most commonly used. In this work, we propose integrated Fourier features, which extends these performance benefits to a very broad class of stationary covariance functions. We motivate the method and choice of parameters from a convergence analysis and empirical exploration, and show practical speedup in synthetic and real world spatial regression tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sketch-Plan-Generalize: Continual Few-Shot Learning of Inductively Generalizable Spatial Concepts for Language-Guided Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07774v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our goal is to build embodied agents that can learn inductively generalizable spatial concepts in a continual manner, e.g, constructing a tower of a given height. Existing work suffers from certain limitations (a) (Liang et al., 2023) and their multi-modal extensions, rely heavily on prior knowledge and are not grounded in the demonstrations (b) (Liu et al., 2023) lack the ability to generalize due to their purely neural approach. A key challenge is to achieve a fine balance between symbolic representations which have the capability to generalize, and neural representations that are physically grounded. In response, we propose a neuro-symbolic approach by expressing inductive concepts as symbolic compositions over grounded neural concepts. Our key insight is to decompose the concept learning problem into the following steps 1) Sketch: Getting a programmatic representation for the given instruction 2) Plan: Perform Model-Based RL over the sequence of grounded neural action concepts to learn a grounded plan 3) Generalize: Abstract out a generic (lifted) Python program to facilitate generalizability. Continual learning is achieved by interspersing learning of grounded neural concepts with higher level symbolic constructs. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing baselines in terms of its ability to learn novel concepts and generalize inductively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Localize Objects Improves Spatial Reasoning in Visual-LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07449v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into visual domain tasks, resulting in visual-LLMs (V-LLMs), has enabled exceptional performance in vision-language tasks, particularly for visual question answering (VQA). However, existing V-LLMs (e.g. BLIP-2, LLaVA) demonstrate weak spatial reasoning and localization awareness. Despite generating highly descriptive and elaborate textual answers, these models fail at simple tasks like distinguishing a left vs right location. In this work, we explore how image-space coordinate based instruction fine-tuning objectives could inject spatial awareness into V-LLMs. We discover optimal coordinate representations, data-efficient instruction fine-tuning objectives, and pseudo-data generation strategies that lead to improved spatial awareness in V-LLMs. Additionally, our resulting model improves VQA across image and video domains, reduces undesired hallucination, and generates better contextual object descriptions. Experiments across 5 vision-language tasks involving 14 different datasets establish the clear performance improvements achieved by our proposed framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Zero-Freeness to Strong Spatial Mixing via a Christoffel-Darboux Type Identity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09317v2)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a unifying approach to derive the strong spatial mixing (SSM) property for the general 2-spin system from zero-free regions of its partition function. Our approach works for the multivariate partition function over all three complex parameters $(\beta, \gamma, \lambda)$, and we allow the zero-free regions of $\beta, \gamma$ or $\lambda$ to be of arbitrary shapes. As long as the zero-free region contains a positive point and it is a complex neighborhood of $\lambda=0$ when fixing $\beta, \gamma \in \mathbb{C}$, or a complex neighborhood of $\beta\gamma=1$ when fixing $\beta, \lambda\in \mathbb{C}$ or $\gamma, \lambda\in \mathbb{C}$ respectively, we are able to show that the corresponding 2-spin system exhibits SSM on such a region. The underlying graphs of the 2-spin system are not necessarily of bounded degree, while are required to include graphs with pinned vertices. We prove this result by establishing a Christoffel-Darboux type identity for the 2-spin system on trees. This identity plays an important role in our approach and is of its own interests. We also use certain tools from complex analysis such as Riemann mapping theorem. Our approach comprehensively turns all existing zero-free regions (to our best knowledge) of the partition function of the 2-spin system where pinned vertices are allowed into the SSM property. As a consequence, we obtain new SSM results for the 2-spin system beyond the direct argument for SSM based on tree recurrence. Moreover, we extend our approach to handle the 2-spin system with non-uniform external fields. As an application, we obtain a new SSM result for the non-uniform ferromagnetic Ising model from the celebrated Lee-Yang circle theorem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main results are slightly improved: A new condition under which Theorem 1 also holds was added.

| **[The CAST package for training and assessment of spatial prediction models in R](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06978v1)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One key task in environmental science is to map environmental variables continuously in space or even in space and time. Machine learning algorithms are frequently used to learn from local field observations to make spatial predictions by estimating the value of the variable of interest in places where it has not been measured. However, the application of machine learning strategies for spatial mapping involves additional challenges compared to "non-spatial" prediction tasks that often originate from spatial autocorrelation and from training data that are not independent and identically distributed. In the past few years, we developed a number of methods to support the application of machine learning for spatial data which involves the development of suitable cross-validation strategies for performance assessment and model selection, spatial feature selection, and methods to assess the area of applicability of the trained models. The intention of the CAST package is to support the application of machine learning strategies for predictive mapping by implementing such methods and making them available for easy integration into modelling workflows. Here we introduce the CAST package and its core functionalities. At the case study of mapping plant species richness, we will go through the different steps of the modelling workflow and show how CAST can be used to support more reliable spatial predictions.</p></details> | 16 pages,9 figures |
| **[Dynamical low-rank approximation of the Vlasov-Poisson equation with piecewise linear spatial boundary](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01856v3)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA) for the numerical simulation of Vlasov--Poisson equations based on separation of space and velocity variables, as proposed in several recent works. The standard approach for the time integration in the DLRA model uses a splitting of the tangent space projector for the low-rank manifold according to the separated variables. It can also be modified to allow for rank-adaptivity. A less studied aspect is the incorporation of boundary conditions in the DLRA model. We propose a variational formulation of the projector splitting which allows to handle inflow boundary conditions on spatial domains with piecewise linear boundary. Numerical experiments demonstrate the principle feasibility of this approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at https://github.com/azeiser/dlra-bc</p></details> |
| **[Sensor-based Multi-Robot Coverage Control with Spatial Separation in Unstructured Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01710v2)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-robot systems have increasingly become instrumental in tackling search and coverage problems. However, the challenge of optimizing task efficiency without compromising task success still persists, particularly in expansive, unstructured environments with dense obstacles. This paper presents an innovative, decentralized Voronoi-based approach for search and coverage to reactively navigate these complexities while maintaining safety. This approach leverages the active sensing capabilities of multi-robot systems to supplement GIS (Geographic Information System), offering a more comprehensive and real-time understanding of the environment. Based on point cloud data, which is inherently non-convex and unstructured, this method efficiently generates collision-free Voronoi regions using only local sensing information through spatial decomposition and spherical mirroring techniques. Then, deadlock-aware guided map integrated with a gradient-optimized, centroid Voronoi-based coverage control policy, is constructed to improve efficiency by avoiding exhaustive searches and local sensing pitfalls. The effectiveness of our algorithm has been validated through extensive numerical simulations in high-fidelity environments, demonstrating significant improvements in both task success rate, coverage ratio, and task execution time compared with others.</p></details> |  |
| **[Phase Guided Light Field for Spatial-Depth High Resolution 3D Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10568v2)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>On 3D imaging, light field cameras typically are of single shot, and however, they heavily suffer from low spatial resolution and depth accuracy. In this paper, by employing an optical projector to project a group of single high-frequency phase-shifted sinusoid patterns, we propose a phase guided light field algorithm to significantly improve both the spatial and depth resolutions for off-the-shelf light field cameras. First, for correcting the axial aberrations caused by the main lens of our light field camera, we propose a deformed cone model to calibrate our structured light field system. Second, over wrapped phases computed from patterned images, we propose a stereo matching algorithm, i.e. phase guided sum of absolute difference, to robustly obtain the correspondence for each pair of neighbored two lenslets. Finally, by introducing a virtual camera according to the basic geometrical optics of light field imaging, we propose a reorganization strategy to reconstruct 3D point clouds with spatial-depth high resolution. Experimental results show that, compared with the state-of-the-art active light field methods, the proposed reconstructs 3D point clouds with a spatial resolution of 1280$\times$720 with factors 10$\times$ increased, while maintaining the same high depth resolution and needing merely a single group of high-frequency patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatially Optimized Compact Deep Metric Learning Model for Similarity Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06593v1)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial optimization is often overlooked in many computer vision tasks. Filters should be able to recognize the features of an object regardless of where it is in the image. Similarity search is a crucial task where spatial features decide an important output. The capacity of convolution to capture visual patterns across various locations is limited. In contrast to convolution, the involution kernel is dynamically created at each pixel based on the pixel value and parameters that have been learned. This study demonstrates that utilizing a single layer of involution feature extractor alongside a compact convolution model significantly enhances the performance of similarity search. Additionally, we improve predictions by using the GELU activation function rather than the ReLU. The negligible amount of weight parameters in involution with a compact model with better performance makes the model very useful in real-world implementations. Our proposed model is below 1 megabyte in size. We have experimented with our proposed methodology and other models on CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, and MNIST datasets. Our proposed method outperforms across all three datasets.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures, |
| **[A Spatial Autoregressive Graphical Model with Applications in Intercropping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04325v3)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Within the statistical literature, a significant gap exists in methods capable of modeling asymmetric multivariate spatial effects that elucidate the relationships underlying complex spatial phenomena. For such a phenomenon, observations at any location are expected to arise from a combination of within- and between- location effects, where the latter exhibit asymmetry. This asymmetry is represented by heterogeneous spatial effects between locations pertaining to different categories, that is, a feature inherent to each location in the data, such that based on the feature label, asymmetric spatial relations are postulated between neighbouring locations with different labels. Our novel approach synergises the principles of multivariate spatial autoregressive models and the Gaussian graphical model. This synergy enables us to effectively address the gap by accommodating asymmetric spatial relations, overcoming the usual constraints in spatial analyses. Using a Bayesian-estimation framework, the model performance is assessed in a simulation study. We apply the model on intercropping data, where spatial effects between different crops are unlikely to be symmetric, in order to illustrate the usage of the proposed methodology. An R package containing the proposed methodology can be found on https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SAGM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Multi-level Association for Video Object Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06265v1)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing semi-supervised video object segmentation methods either focus on temporal feature matching or spatial-temporal feature modeling. However, they do not address the issues of sufficient target interaction and efficient parallel processing simultaneously, thereby constraining the learning of dynamic, target-aware features. To tackle these limitations, this paper proposes a spatial-temporal multi-level association framework, which jointly associates reference frame, test frame, and object features to achieve sufficient interaction and parallel target ID association with a spatial-temporal memory bank for efficient video object segmentation. Specifically, we construct a spatial-temporal multi-level feature association module to learn better target-aware features, which formulates feature extraction and interaction as the efficient operations of object self-attention, reference object enhancement, and test reference correlation. In addition, we propose a spatial-temporal memory to assist feature association and temporal ID assignment and correlation. We evaluate the proposed method by conducting extensive experiments on numerous video object segmentation datasets, including DAVIS 2016/2017 val, DAVIS 2017 test-dev, and YouTube-VOS 2018/2019 val. The favorable performance against the state-of-the-art methods demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. All source code and trained models will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[ColorMNet: A Memory-based Deep Spatial-Temporal Feature Propagation Network for Video Colorization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06251v1)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How to effectively explore spatial-temporal features is important for video colorization. Instead of stacking multiple frames along the temporal dimension or recurrently propagating estimated features that will accumulate errors or cannot explore information from far-apart frames, we develop a memory-based feature propagation module that can establish reliable connections with features from far-apart frames and alleviate the influence of inaccurately estimated features. To extract better features from each frame for the above-mentioned feature propagation, we explore the features from large-pretrained visual models to guide the feature estimation of each frame so that the estimated features can model complex scenarios. In addition, we note that adjacent frames usually contain similar contents. To explore this property for better spatial and temporal feature utilization, we develop a local attention module to aggregate the features from adjacent frames in a spatial-temporal neighborhood. We formulate our memory-based feature propagation module, large-pretrained visual model guided feature estimation module, and local attention module into an end-to-end trainable network (named ColorMNet) and show that it performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods on both the benchmark datasets and real-world scenarios.

| **[ClusterRadar: an Interactive Web-Tool for the Multi-Method Exploration of Spatial Clusters Over Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05897v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial cluster analysis, the detection of localized patterns of similarity in geospatial data, has a wide-range of applications for scientific discovery and practical decision making. One way to detect spatial clusters is by using local indicators of spatial association, such as Local Moran's I or Getis-Ord Gi*. However, different indicators tend to produce substantially different results due to their distinct operational characteristics. Choosing a suitable method or comparing results from multiple methods is a complex task. Furthermore, spatial clusters are dynamic and it is often useful to track their evolution over time, which adds an additional layer of complexity. ClusterRadar is a web-tool designed to address these analytical challenges. The tool allows users to easily perform spatial clustering and analyze the results in an interactive environment, uniquely prioritizing temporal analysis and the comparison of multiple methods. The tool's interactive dashboard presents several visualizations, each offering a distinct perspective of the temporal and methodological aspects of the spatial clustering results. ClusterRadar has several features designed to maximize its utility to a broad user-base, including support for various geospatial formats, and a fully in-browser execution environment to preserve the privacy of sensitive data. Feedback from a varied set of researchers suggests ClusterRadar's potential for enhancing the temporal analysis of spatial clusters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Vis 2024</p></details> |
| **[WEEP: A method for spatial interpretation of weakly supervised CNN models in computational pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15238v2)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning enables the modelling of high-resolution histopathology whole-slide images (WSI). Weakly supervised learning of tile-level data is typically applied for tasks where labels only exist on the patient or WSI level (e.g. patient outcomes or histological grading). In this context, there is a need for improved spatial interpretability of predictions from such models. We propose a novel method, Wsi rEgion sElection aPproach (WEEP), for model interpretation. It provides a principled yet straightforward way to establish the spatial area of WSI required for assigning a particular prediction label. We demonstrate WEEP on a binary classification task in the area of breast cancer computational pathology. WEEP is easy to implement, is directly connected to the model-based decision process, and offers information relevant to both research and diagnostic applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking the Spatial Inconsistency in Classifier-Free Diffusion Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05384v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has been widely used in text-to-image diffusion models, where the CFG scale is introduced to control the strength of text guidance on the whole image space. However, we argue that a global CFG scale results in spatial inconsistency on varying semantic strengths and suboptimal image quality. To address this problem, we present a novel approach, Semantic-aware Classifier-Free Guidance (S-CFG), to customize the guidance degrees for different semantic units in text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, we first design a training-free semantic segmentation method to partition the latent image into relatively independent semantic regions at each denoising step. In particular, the cross-attention map in the denoising U-net backbone is renormalized for assigning each patch to the corresponding token, while the self-attention map is used to complete the semantic regions. Then, to balance the amplification of diverse semantic units, we adaptively adjust the CFG scales across different semantic regions to rescale the text guidance degrees into a uniform level. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of S-CFG over the original CFG strategy on various text-to-image diffusion models, without requiring any extra training cost. our codes are available at https://github.com/SmilesDZgk/S-CFG.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by CVPR-2024</p></details> |
| **[SegForestNet: Spatial-Partitioning-Based Aerial Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01585v3)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aerial image segmentation is the basis for applications such as automatically creating maps or tracking deforestation. In true orthophotos, which are often used in these applications, many objects and regions can be approximated well by polygons. However, this fact is rarely exploited by state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models. Instead, most models allow unnecessary degrees of freedom in their predictions by allowing arbitrary region shapes. We therefore present a refinement of our deep learning model which predicts binary space partitioning trees, an efficient polygon representation. The refinements include a new feature decoder architecture and a new differentiable BSP tree renderer which both avoid vanishing gradients. Additionally, we designed a novel loss function specifically designed to improve the spatial partitioning defined by the predicted trees. Furthermore, our expanded model can predict multiple trees at once and thus can predict class-specific segmentations. As an additional contribution, we investigate the impact of a non-optimal training process in comparison to an optimized training process. While model architectures optimized for aerial images, such as PFNet or our own model, show an advantage under non-optimal conditions, this advantage disappears under optimal training conditions. Despite this observation, our model still makes better predictions for small rectangular objects, e.g., cars.</p></details> |  |

We first introduce a linear minimum-mean-square error estimation algorithm for the aggregate channel by considering the impact of transceiver HWI and RIS phase-shift errors. Then, we derive a lower bound for the achievable ergodic secrecy rate in the presence of a multi-antenna eavesdropper when artificial noise (AN) is employed at the base station (BS). In addition, the obtained expressions of the ergodic secrecy rate are further simplified in some noteworthy special cases to obtain valuable insights. To counteract the effects of HWI, we present a power allocation optimization strategy between the confidential signals and AN, which admits a fixed-point equation solution. Our analysis reveals that a non-zero ergodic secrecy rate is preserved if the total transmit power decreases no faster than $1/N$, where $N$ is the number of RIS elements. Moreover, the ergodic secrecy rate grows logarithmically with the number of BS antennas $M$ and approaches a certain limit in the asymptotic regime $N\rightarrow\infty$. Simulation results are provided to verify the derived analytical results. They reveal the impact of key design parameters on the secrecy rate. It is shown that, with the proposed power allocation strategy, the secrecy rate loss due to HWI can be counteracted by increasing the number of low-cost RIS elements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications</p></details> |
| **[Empirical Upscaling of Point-scale Soil Moisture Measurements for Spatial Evaluation of Model Simulations and Satellite Retrievals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05229v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evaluation of modelled or satellite-derived soil moisture (SM) estimates is usually dependent on comparisons against in-situ SM measurements. However, the inherent mismatch in spatial support (i.e., scale) necessitates a cautious interpretation of point-to-pixel comparisons. The upscaling of the in-situ measurements to a commensurate resolution to that of the modelled or retrieved SM will lead to a fairer comparison and statistically more defensible evaluation. In this study, we presented an upscaling approach that combines spatiotemporal fusion with machine learning to extrapolate point-scale SM measurements from 28 in-situ sites to a 100 m resolution for an agricultural area of 100 km by 100 km. We conducted a four-fold cross-validation, which consistently demonstrated comparable correlation performance across folds, ranging from 0.6 to 0.9. The proposed approach was further validated based on a cross-cluster strategy by using two spatial subsets within the study area, denoted as cluster A and B, each of which equally comprised of 12 in-situ sites. The cross-cluster validation underscored the capability of the upscaling approach to map the spatial variability of SM within areas that were not covered by in-situ sites, with correlation performance ranging between 0.6 and 0.8. In general, our proposed upscaling approach offers an avenue to extrapolate point measurements of SM to a spatial scale more akin to climatic model grids or remotely sensed observations. Future investigations should delve into a further evaluation of the upscaling approach using independent data, such as model simulations, satellite retrievals or field campaign data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and selected as the Student Paper Competition finalists at the 2024 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS 2024)</p></details> |

The traffic of a road network can be affected by long-distance or long-term dependencies where existing methods fall short in modeling them. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework known as Spatial-Temporal Multi-Granularity Framework (STMGF) to enhance the capture of long-distance and long-term information of the road networks. STMGF makes full use of different granularity information of road networks and models the long-distance and long-term information by gathering information in a hierarchical interactive way. Further, it leverages the inherent periodicity in traffic sequences to refine prediction results by matching with recent traffic data. We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that STMGF outperforms all baseline models and achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we aim to mimic this spatial cognition ability. We thus formulate the task of Out of Sight, Not Out of Mind - 3D tracking active objects using observations captured through an egocentric camera. We introduce Lift, Match and Keep (LMK), a method which lifts partial 2D observations to 3D world coordinates, matches them over time using visual appearance, 3D location and interactions to form object tracks, and keeps these object tracks even when they go out-of-view of the camera - hence keeping in mind what is out of sight. We test LMK on 100 long videos from EPIC-KITCHENS. Our results demonstrate that spatial cognition is critical for correctly locating objects over short and long time scales. E.g., for one long egocentric video, we estimate the 3D location of 50 active objects. Of these, 60% can be correctly positioned in 3D after 2 minutes of leaving the camera view.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages including references and appendix.

These movements emerged through virtual social networks as well as local protest gatherings. Prior research has studied such movements solely in the virtual space through social network analysis, thereby disregarding the role of local interaction for protest. This study, however, recognizes the importance of the geo-spatial dimension in protest movements. We therefore introduce a large-scale spatial-social network analysis of a georeferenced Twitter user network to understand the regional connections and transnational influences of the Austrian COVID-19 protest movement through the social network. Our findings reveal that the virtual network is distinctly structured along geographic and linguistic boundaries. We further find that the movement is clearly organized along national protest communities. These results highlight the importance of regional and local influencing factors over the impact of transnational influences for the protest movement.</p></details> |  |
| **[StepNet: Spatial-temporal Part-aware Network for Isolated Sign Language Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12857v2)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of sign language recognition (SLR) is to help those who are hard of hearing or deaf overcome the communication barrier. Most existing approaches can be typically divided into two lines, i.e., Skeleton-based and RGB-based methods, but both the two lines of methods have their limitations. Skeleton-based methods do not consider facial expressions, while RGB-based approaches usually ignore the fine-grained hand structure. To overcome both limitations, we propose a new framework called Spatial-temporal Part-aware network~(StepNet), based on RGB parts. As its name suggests, it is made up of two modules: Part-level Spatial Modeling and Part-level Temporal Modeling. Part-level Spatial Modeling, in particular, automatically captures the appearance-based properties, such as hands and faces, in the feature space without the use of any keypoint-level annotations. On the other hand, Part-level Temporal Modeling implicitly mines the long-short term context to capture the relevant attributes over time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our StepNet, thanks to spatial-temporal modules, achieves competitive Top-1 Per-instance accuracy on three commonly-used SLR benchmarks, i.e., 56.89% on WLASL, 77.2% on NMFs-CSL, and 77.1% on BOBSL. Additionally, the proposed method is compatible with the optical flow input and can produce superior performance if fused. For those who are hard of hearing, we hope that our work can act as a preliminary step.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding the Potential of FPGA-Based Spatial Acceleration for Large Language Model Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15159v2)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) boasting billions of parameters have generated a significant demand for efficient deployment in inference workloads. The majority of existing approaches rely on temporal architectures that reuse hardware units for different network layers and operators. However, these methods often encounter challenges in achieving low latency due to considerable memory access overhead. This paper investigates the feasibility and potential of model-specific spatial acceleration for LLM inference on FPGAs. Our approach involves the specialization of distinct hardware units for specific operators or layers, facilitating direct communication between them through a dataflow architecture while minimizing off-chip memory accesses. We introduce a comprehensive analytical model for estimating the performance of a spatial LLM accelerator, taking into account the on-chip compute and memory resources available on an FPGA. Through our analysis, we can determine the scenarios in which FPGA-based spatial acceleration can outperform its GPU-based counterpart. To enable more productive implementations of an LLM model on FPGAs, we further provide a library of high-level synthesis (HLS) kernels that are composable and reusable. This library will be made available as open-source. To validate the effectiveness of both our analytical model and HLS library, we have implemented BERT and GPT2 on an AMD Alveo U280 FPGA device. Experimental results demonstrate our approach can achieve up to 13.4x speedup when compared to previous FPGA-based accelerators for the BERT model. For GPT generative inference, we attain a 2.2x speedup compared to DFX, an FPGA overlay, in the prefill stage, while achieving a 1.9x speedup and a 5.7x improvement in energy efficiency compared to the NVIDIA A100 GPU in the decode stage.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the FCCM'24 Journal Track and will appear in ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems (TRETS)</p></details> |

Nevertheless, the future industry demands innovative solutions to streamline the interaction process between humans and drones to enable seamless collaboration and efficient co-working. In this paper, we present a novel tele-immersive framework that promotes cognitive and physical collaboration between humans and robots through Mixed Reality (MR). This framework incorporates a novel bi-directional spatial awareness and a multi-modal virtual-physical interaction approaches. The former seamlessly integrates the physical and virtual worlds, offering bidirectional egocentric and exocentric environmental representations. The latter, leveraging the proposed spatial representation, further enhances the collaboration combining a robot planning algorithm for obstacle avoidance with a variable admittance control. This allows users to issue commands based on virtual forces while maintaining compatibility with the environment map. We validate the proposed approach by performing several collaborative planning and exploration tasks involving a drone and an user equipped with a MR headset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently Accepted at International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2024, Nominated as Finalist for IEEE ICRA 2024 Best Paper Award on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles</p></details> |

Our study data consists of GPS-based tracks of individual white-tailed deer (\textit{Odocoileus virginianus}) and three exotic Cervid species moving freely in a 172-ha high-fenced game preserve over given time periods. A serological test was performed on each individual to measure the antibody concentration of epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) for each of three serotypes (EHDV-1, -2, and -6) at the beginning and at the end of each tracking period. EHDV is a vector-borne viral disease indirectly transmitted between ruminant hosts by biting midges (\textit{Culicoides} spp.). The purpose of this study is to estimate the spatial distribution of infection propensity by performing an epidemiological tomography of a region using tracers. We model the data as a binomial linear inverse problem, where spatial coherence is enforced with a total variation regularization. The smoothness of the reconstructed propensity map is selected by the quantile universal threshold, which can also test the null hypothesis that the propensity map is spatially constant. We apply our method to simulated and real data, showing good statistical properties during simulations and consistent results and interpretations compared to intensive field estimations.</p></details> |  |

Previous methods for estimating illumination using volumetric representations have overlooked the sparse distribution of light sources in space, necessitating substantial memory and computational resources for achieving high-quality results. We introduce a unified, voxel octree-based illumination estimation framework to produce 3D spatially-coherent lighting. Additionally, a differentiable voxel octree cone tracing rendering layer is proposed to eliminate regular volumetric representation throughout the entire process and ensure the retention of features across different frequency domains. This reduction significantly decreases spatial usage and required floating-point operations without substantially compromising precision. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high-quality coherent estimation with minimal cost compared to previous methods.</p></details> |  |

Here, we propose a new, flexible class of spatial-process models, which we refer to as spatial Bayesian neural networks (SBNNs). An SBNN leverages the representational capacity of a Bayesian neural network; it is tailored to a spatial setting by incorporating a spatial ``embedding layer'' into the network and, possibly, spatially-varying network parameters. An SBNN is calibrated by matching its finite-dimensional distribution at locations on a fine gridding of space to that of a target process of interest. That process could be easy to simulate from or we may have many realisations from it. We propose several variants of SBNNs, most of which are able to match the finite-dimensional distribution of the target process at the selected grid better than conventional BNNs of similar complexity. We also show that an SBNN can be used to represent a variety of spatial processes often used in practice, such as Gaussian processes, lognormal processes, and max-stable processes. We briefly discuss the tools that could be used to make inference with SBNNs, and we conclude with a discussion of their advantages and limitations.</p></details> | 35 pages, 21 figures |

While classical depth estimation methods infer only a 2.5D scene representation limited to the image plane, recent approaches based on radiance fields reconstruct a full 3D representation. However, these methods still struggle with occluded regions since inferring geometry without visual observation requires (i) semantic knowledge of the surroundings, and (ii) reasoning about spatial context. We propose KYN, a novel method for single-view scene reconstruction that reasons about semantic and spatial context to predict each point's density. We introduce a vision-language modulation module to enrich point features with fine-grained semantic information. We aggregate point representations across the scene through a language-guided spatial attention mechanism to yield per-point density predictions aware of the 3D semantic context. We show that KYN improves 3D shape recovery compared to predicting density for each 3D point in isolation. We achieve state-of-the-art results in scene and object reconstruction on KITTI-360, and show improved zero-shot generalization compared to prior work.

However, their abilities in spatial reasoning, a crucial aspect of human cognition, remain relatively unexplored. Human possess a remarkable ability to create mental images of unseen objects and actions through a process known as \textbf{the Mind's Eye}, enabling the imagination of the unseen world. Inspired by this cognitive capacity, we propose Visualization-of-Thought (\textbf{VoT}) prompting. VoT aims to elicit spatial reasoning of LLMs by visualizing their reasoning traces, thereby guiding subsequent reasoning steps. We employed VoT for multi-hop spatial reasoning tasks, including natural language navigation, visual navigation, and visual tiling in 2D grid worlds. Experimental results demonstrated that VoT significantly enhances the spatial reasoning abilities of LLMs. Notably, VoT outperformed existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in these tasks. While VoT works surprisingly well on LLMs, the ability to generate \textit{mental images} to facilitate spatial reasoning resembles the mind's eye process, suggesting its potential viability in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose self-attention GCN hybrid model, Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal self-attention (MSST)-GCN to effectively improve modeling ability to achieve state-of-the-art results on several datasets. We utilize spatial self-attention module with adaptive topology to understand intra-frame interactions within a frame among different body parts, and temporal self-attention module to examine correlations between frames of a node. These two are followed by multi-scale convolution network with dilations, which not only captures the long-range temporal dependencies of joints but also the long-range spatial dependencies (i.e., long-distance dependencies) of node temporal behaviors. They are combined into high-level spatial-temporal representations and output the predicted action with the softmax classifier.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

Because most types of sensory loss have no pharmacological treatment or rehabilitative therapy, we propose a haptic sensory prosthesis that provides substitutive feedback. The wrist and forearm are compelling locations for feedback due to available skin area and not occluding the hands, but have reduced mechanoreceptor density compared to the fingertips. Focusing on localized pressure as the feedback modality, we hypothesize that we can improve on prior devices by invoking a wider range of stimulus intensity using multiple points of pressure to evoke spatial summation, which is the cumulative perceptual experience from multiple points of stimuli. We conducted a preliminary perceptual test to investigate this idea and found that just noticeable difference is reduced with two points of pressure compared to one, motivating future work using spatial summation in sensory prostheses.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 pag...</summary><p>2 pages, 2 figures, 2024 IEEE Haptics Symposium Work-in-Progress Paper</p></details> |

However, existing diffusion-based video editing approaches lack the ability to offer precise control over generated content that maintains temporal consistency in long-term videos. On the other hand, atlas-based methods provide strong temporal consistency but are costly to edit a video and lack spatial control. In this work, we introduce VidEdit, a novel method for zero-shot text-based video editing that guarantees robust temporal and spatial consistency. In particular, we combine an atlas-based video representation with a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to provide a training-free and efficient video editing method, which by design fulfills temporal smoothness. To grant precise user control over generated content, we utilize conditional information extracted from off-the-shelf panoptic segmenters and edge detectors which guides the diffusion sampling process. This method ensures a fine spatial control on targeted regions while strictly preserving the structure of the original video. Our quantitative and qualitative experiments show that VidEdit outperforms state-of-the-art methods on DAVIS dataset, regarding semantic faithfulness, image preservation, and temporal consistency metrics. With this framework, processing a single video only takes approximately one minute, and it can generate multiple compatible edits based on a unique text prompt.

(2) CT-scan contains large number of out-of-distribution (OOD) slices. The crucial features may only be present in specific spatial regions and slices of the entire CT scan. How can we effectively figure out where these are located? To deal with this, we introduce an enhanced Spatial-Slice Feature Learning (SSFL++) framework specifically designed for CT scan. It aim to filter out a OOD data within whole CT scan, enabling our to select crucial spatial-slice for analysis by reducing 70% redundancy totally. Meanwhile, we proposed Kernel-Density-based slice Sampling (KDS) method to improve the stability when training and inference stage, therefore speeding up the rate of convergence and boosting performance. As a result, the experiments demonstrate the promising performance of our model using a simple EfficientNet-2D (E2D) model, even with only 1% of the training data.

Arriving EVs receive feedback on transport times to each station, and waiting times at congested ones, based on which they make a selfish selection. This selection determines total arrival rates in station queues, which are represented by a fluid state; departure rates are modeled under the assumption that clients have a given sojourn time in the system. The resulting differential equation system is analyzed with tools of optimization. We characterize the equilibrium as the solution to a specific convex program, which has connections to optimal transport problems, and also with road traffic theory. In particular a price of anarchy appears with respect to a social planner's allocation. From a dynamical perspective, global convergence to equilibrium is established, with tools of Lagrange duality and Lyapunov theory. An extension of the model that makes customer demand elastic to observed delays is also presented, and analyzed with extensions of the optimization machinery. Simulations to illustrate the global behavior are presented, which also help validate the model beyond the fluid approximation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we offer a comprehensive investigation of this limitation, while also developing datasets and methods that achieve state-of-the-art performance. First, we find that current vision-language datasets do not represent spatial relationships well enough; to alleviate this bottleneck, we create SPRIGHT, the first spatially-focused, large scale dataset, by re-captioning 6 million images from 4 widely used vision datasets. Through a 3-fold evaluation and analysis pipeline, we find that SPRIGHT largely improves upon existing datasets in capturing spatial relationships. To demonstrate its efficacy, we leverage only ~0.25% of SPRIGHT and achieve a 22% improvement in generating spatially accurate images while also improving the FID and CMMD scores. Secondly, we find that training on images containing a large number of objects results in substantial improvements in spatial consistency. Notably, we attain state-of-the-art on T2I-CompBench with a spatial score of 0.2133, by fine-tuning on <500 images. Finally, through a set of controlled experiments and ablations, we document multiple findings that we believe will enhance the understanding of factors that affect spatial consistency in text-to-image models.

Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) can effectively capture such spatial feature representations and have demonstrated promising results in performing hyperspectral imagery (HSI) classification tasks of complex land. However, the existing GCN-based HSI classification methods are prone to interference from redundant information when extracting complex features. To classify complex scenes more effectively, this study proposes a novel spatial-spectral reliable contrastive graph convolutional classification framework named S2RC-GCN. Specifically, we fused the spectral and spatial features extracted by the 1D- and 2D-encoder, and the 2D-encoder includes an attention model to automatically extract important information. We then leveraged the fused high-level features to construct graphs and fed the resulting graphs into the GCNs to determine more effective graph representations. Furthermore, a novel reliable contrastive graph convolution was proposed for reliable contrastive learning to learn and fuse robust features. Finally, to test the performance of the model on complex object classification, we used imagery taken by Gaofen-5 in the Jiang Xia area to construct complex land cover datasets. The test results show that compared with other models, our model achieved the best results and effectively improved the classification performance of complex remote sensing imagery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCNN 2024 (International Joint Conference on Neural Networks)</p></details> |

| **[DMSSN: Distilled Mixed Spectral-Spatial Network for Hyperspectral Salient Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00694v1)** | 2024-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral salient object detection (HSOD) has exhibited remarkable promise across various applications, particularly in intricate scenarios where conventional RGB-based approaches fall short. Despite the considerable progress in HSOD method advancements, two critical challenges require immediate attention. Firstly, existing hyperspectral data dimension reduction techniques incur a loss of spectral information, which adversely affects detection accuracy. Secondly, previous methods insufficiently harness the inherent distinctive attributes of hyperspectral images (HSIs) during the feature extraction process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach termed the Distilled Mixed Spectral-Spatial Network (DMSSN), comprising a Distilled Spectral Encoding process and a Mixed Spectral-Spatial Transformer (MSST) feature extraction network. The encoding process utilizes knowledge distillation to construct a lightweight autoencoder for dimension reduction, striking a balance between robust encoding capabilities and low computational costs. The MSST extracts spectral-spatial features through multiple attention head groups, collaboratively enhancing its resistance to intricate scenarios. Moreover, we have created a large-scale HSOD dataset, HSOD-BIT, to tackle the issue of data scarcity in this field and meet the fundamental data requirements of deep network training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DMSSN achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets. We will soon make the code and dataset publicly available on https://github.com/anonymous0519/HSOD-BIT.</p></details> |  |
| **[STG-Mamba: Spatial-Temporal Graph Learning via Selective State Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12418v2)** | 2024-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial-Temporal Graph (STG) data is characterized as dynamic, heterogenous, and non-stationary, leading to the continuous challenge of spatial-temporal graph learning. In the past few years, various GNN-based methods have been proposed to solely focus on mimicking the relationships among node individuals of the STG network, ignoring the significance of modeling the intrinsic features that exist in STG system over time. In contrast, modern Selective State Space Models (SSSMs) present a new approach which treat STG Network as a system, and meticulously explore the STG system's dynamic state evolution across temporal dimension. In this work, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Graph Mamba (STG-Mamba) as the first exploration of leveraging the powerful selective state space models for STG learning by treating STG Network as a system, and employing the Graph Selective State Space Block (GS3B) to precisely characterize the dynamic evolution of STG networks. STG-Mamba is formulated as an Encoder-Decoder architecture, which takes GS3B as the basic module, for efficient sequential data modeling. Furthermore, to strengthen GNN's ability of modeling STG data under the setting of SSSMs, we propose Kalman Filtering Graph Neural Networks (KFGN) for adaptive graph structure upgrading. KFGN smoothly fits in the context of selective state space evolution, and at the same time keeps linear complexity. Extensive empirical studies are conducted on three benchmark STG forecasting datasets, demonstrating the performance superiority and computational efficiency of STG-Mamba. It not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of STG forecasting performance, but also effectively alleviate the computational bottleneck of large-scale graph networks in reducing the computational cost of FLOPs and test inference time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial meshing for general Bayesian multivariate models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10080v2)** | 2024-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantifying spatial and/or temporal associations in multivariate geolocated data of different types is achievable via spatial random effects in a Bayesian hierarchical model, but severe computational bottlenecks arise when spatial dependence is encoded as a latent Gaussian process (GP) in the increasingly common large scale data settings on which we focus. The scenario worsens in non-Gaussian models because the reduced analytical tractability leads to additional hurdles to computational efficiency. In this article, we introduce Bayesian models of spatially referenced data in which the likelihood or the latent process (or both) are not Gaussian. First, we exploit the advantages of spatial processes built via directed acyclic graphs, in which case the spatial nodes enter the Bayesian hierarchy and lead to posterior sampling via routine Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Second, motivated by the possible inefficiencies of popular gradient-based sampling approaches in the multivariate contexts on which we focus, we introduce the simplified manifold preconditioner adaptation (SiMPA) algorithm which uses second order information about the target but avoids expensive matrix operations. We demostrate the performance and efficiency improvements of our methods relative to alternatives in extensive synthetic and real world remote sensing and community ecology applications with large scale data at up to hundreds of thousands of spatial locations and up to tens of outcomes. Software for the proposed methods is part of R package 'meshed', available on CRAN.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReGround: Improving Textual and Spatial Grounding at No Cost](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13589v2)** | 2024-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When an image generation process is guided by both a text prompt and spatial cues, such as a set of bounding boxes, do these elements work in harmony, or does one dominate the other? Our analysis of a pretrained image diffusion model that integrates gated self-attention into the U-Net reveals that spatial grounding often outweighs textual grounding due to the sequential flow from gated self-attention to cross-attention. We demonstrate that such bias can be significantly mitigated without sacrificing accuracy in either grounding by simply rewiring the network architecture, changing from sequential to parallel for gated self-attention and cross-attention. This surprisingly simple yet effective solution does not require any fine-tuning of the network but significantly reduces the trade-off between the two groundings. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements from the original GLIGEN to the rewired version in the trade-off between textual grounding and spatial grounding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://re-ground.github.io/</p></details> |

Recently, the introduction of the vision transformer (ViT) has significantly altered the landscape of deep segmentation models. There has been a growing focus on ViTs, driven by their excellent performance and scalability. However, we argue that the current design of the vision transformer-based UNet (ViT-UNet) segmentation models may not effectively handle the heterogeneous appearance (e.g., varying shapes and sizes) of objects of interest in medical image segmentation tasks. To tackle this challenge, we present a structured approach to introduce spatially dynamic components to the ViT-UNet. This adaptation enables the model to effectively capture features of target objects with diverse appearances. This is achieved by three main components: \textbf{(i)} deformable patch embedding; \textbf{(ii)} spatially dynamic multi-head attention; \textbf{(iii)} deformable positional encoding. These components were integrated into a novel architecture, termed AgileFormer. AgileFormer is a spatially agile ViT-UNet designed for medical image segmentation. Experiments in three segmentation tasks using publicly available datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code is available at \href{https://github.com/sotiraslab/AgileFormer}{https://github.com/sotiraslab/AgileFormer}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flexible Basis Representations for Modeling Large Non-Gaussian Spatial Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06808v3)** | 2024-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nonstationary and non-Gaussian spatial data are common in various fields, including ecology (e.g., counts of animal species), epidemiology (e.g., disease incidence counts in susceptible regions), and environmental science (e.g., remotely-sensed satellite imagery). Due to modern data collection methods, the size of these datasets have grown considerably. Spatial generalized linear mixed models (SGLMMs) are a flexible class of models used to model nonstationary and non-Gaussian datasets. Despite their utility, SGLMMs can be computationally prohibitive for even moderately large datasets (e.g., 5,000 to 100,000 observed locations). To circumvent this issue, past studies have embedded nested radial basis functions into the SGLMM. However, two crucial specifications (knot placement and bandwidth parameters), which directly affect model performance, are typically fixed prior to model-fitting. We propose a novel approach to model large nonstationary and non-Gaussian spatial datasets using adaptive radial basis functions. Our approach: (1) partitions the spatial domain into subregions; (2) employs reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) to infer the number and location of the knots within each partition; and (3) models the latent spatial surface using partition-varying and adaptive basis functions. Through an extensive simulation study, we show that our approach provides more accurate predictions than competing methods while preserving computational efficiency. We demonstrate our approach on two environmental datasets - incidences of plant species and counts of bird species in the United States.</p></details> |  |

They provide insights into mineral exploration, vulnerability to natural hazards, and many other applications. These maps are created using numerical or conceptual models that use geological observations to extrapolate data. Geostatistical techniques have traditionally been used to generate reliable predictions that take into account the spatial patterns inherent in the data. However, as the number of auxiliary variables increases, these methods become more labor-intensive. Additionally, traditional machine learning methods often struggle with spatially correlated data and extracting valuable non-linear information from geoscientific datasets. To address these limitations, a new architecture called the Spatially Constrained Bayesian Network (SCB-Net) has been developed. The SCB-Net aims to effectively exploit the information from auxiliary variables while producing spatially constrained predictions. It is made up of two parts, the first part focuses on learning underlying patterns in the auxiliary variables while the second part integrates ground-truth data and the learned embeddings from the first part. Moreover, to assess model uncertainty, a technique called Monte Carlo dropout is used as a Bayesian approximation. The SCB-Net has been applied to two selected areas in northern Quebec, Canada, and has demonstrated its potential in generating field-data-constrained lithological maps while allowing assessment of prediction uncertainty for decision-making. This study highlights the promising advancements of deep neural networks in geostatistics, particularly in handling complex spatial feature learning tasks, leading to improved spatial information techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3559 words, 14 figures</p></details> |

Efforts have been made to automate this task, but the variable lighting and hole surface conditions, as well as the requirements for short setup and task execution time make the automation challenging. In this study, we introduce a vision and proprioceptive data-driven robot control model for this task that is robust to challenging lighting and hole surface conditions. This model consists of a spatial attention point network (SAP) and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policy that are trained jointly end-to-end to control the robot. The model is trained in an offline manner, with a sample-efficient framework designed to reduce training time and minimize the reality gap when transferring the model to the physical world. Through evaluations with an industrial robot performing the task in 12 unknown holes, starting from 16 different initial positions, and under three different lighting conditions (two with misleading shadows), we demonstrate that SAP can generate relevant attention points of the image even in challenging lighting conditions. We also show that the proposed model enables task execution with higher success rate and shorter task completion time than various baselines. Due to the proposed model's high effectiveness even in severe lighting, initial positions, and hole conditions, and the offline training framework's high sample-efficiency and short training time, this approach can be easily applied to construction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters on 08 February 2023</p></details> |
| **[Nonstationary Spatial Process Models with Spatially Varying Covariance Kernels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11873v2)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial process models for capturing nonstationary behavior in scientific data present several challenges with regard to statistical inference and uncertainty quantification. While nonstationary spatially-varying kernels are attractive for their flexibility and richness, their practical implementation has been reported to be overwhelmingly cumbersome because of the high-dimensional parameter spaces resulting from the spatially varying process parameters. Matters are considerably exacerbated with the massive numbers of spatial locations over which measurements are available. With limited theoretical tractability offered by nonstationary spatial processes, overcoming such computational bottlenecks require a synergy between model construction and algorithm development. We build a class of scalable nonstationary spatial process models using spatially varying covariance kernels. We present some novel consequences of such representations that befit computationally efficient implementation. More specifically, we operate within a coherent Bayesian modeling framework to achieve full uncertainty quantification using a Hybrid Monte-Carlo with nested interweaving. We carry out experiments on synthetic data sets to explore model selection and parameter identifiability and assess inferential improvements accrued from the nonstationary modeling. We illustrate strengths and pitfalls with a data set on remote sensed normalized difference vegetation index with further analysis of a lead contamination data set in the Supplement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transmissive RIS Transmitter Enabled Spatial Modulation for MIMO Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19457v1)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel transmissive reconfigurable intelligent surface (TRIS) transmitter-enabled spatial modulation (SM) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. In the transmission phase, a column-wise activation strategy is implemented for the TRIS panel, where the specific column elements are activated per time slot. Concurrently, the receiver employs the maximum likelihood detection technique. Based on this, for the transmit signals, we derive the closed-form expressions for the upper bounds of the average bit error probability (ABEP) of the proposed scheme from different perspectives, employing both vector-based and element-based approaches. Furthermore, we provide the asymptotic closed-form expressions for the ABEP of the TRIS-SM scheme, as well as the diversity gain. To improve the performance of the proposed TRIS-SM system, we optimize ABEP with a fixed data rate. Additionally, we provide lower bounds to simplify the computational complexity of improved TRIS-SM scheme. The Monte Carlo simulation method is used to validate the theoretical derivations exhaustively. The results demonstrate that the proposed TRIS-SM scheme can achieve better ABEP performance compared to the conventional SM scheme. Furthermore, the improved TRIS-SM scheme outperforms the TRIS-SM scheme in terms of reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[RFAConv: Innovating Spatial Attention and Standard Convolutional Operation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03198v6)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial attention has been widely used to improve the performance of convolutional neural networks. However, it has certain limitations. In this paper, we propose a new perspective on the effectiveness of spatial attention, which is that the spatial attention mechanism essentially solves the problem of convolutional kernel parameter sharing. However, the information contained in the attention map generated by spatial attention is not sufficient for large-size convolutional kernels. Therefore, we propose a novel attention mechanism called Receptive-Field Attention (RFA). Existing spatial attention, such as Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and Coordinated Attention (CA) focus only on spatial features, which does not fully address the problem of convolutional kernel parameter sharing. In contrast, RFA not only focuses on the receptive-field spatial feature but also provides effective attention weights for large-size convolutional kernels. The Receptive-Field Attention convolutional operation (RFAConv), developed by RFA, represents a new approach to replace the standard convolution operation. It offers nearly negligible increment of computational cost and parameters, while significantly improving network performance. We conducted a series of experiments on ImageNet-1k, COCO, and VOC datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Of particular importance, we believe that it is time to shift focus from spatial features to receptive-field spatial features for current spatial attention mechanisms. In this way, we can further improve network performance and achieve even better results. The code and pre-trained models for the relevant tasks can be found at https://github.com/Liuchen1997/RFAConv.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11figures |
| **[Spatial confounding under infill asymptotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18961v1)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The estimation of regression parameters in spatially referenced data plays a crucial role across various scientific domains. A common approach involves employing an additive regression model to capture the relationship between observations and covariates, accounting for spatial variability not explained by the covariates through a Gaussian random field. While theoretical analyses of such models have predominantly focused on prediction and covariance parameter inference, recent attention has shifted towards understanding the theoretical properties of regression coefficient estimates, particularly in the context of spatial confounding. This article studies the effect of misspecified covariates, in particular when the misspecification changes the smoothness. We analyze the theoretical properties of the generalize least-square estimator under infill asymptotics, and show that the estimator can have counter-intuitive properties. In particular, the estimated regression coefficients can converge to zero as the number of observations increases, despite high correlations between observations and covariates. Perhaps even more surprising, the estimates can diverge to infinity under certain conditions. Through an application to temperature and precipitation data, we show that both behaviors can be observed for real data. Finally, we propose a simple fix to the problem by adding a smoothing step in the regression.</p></details> |  |

The historical spatial context of the agent provides a similarity signal for self-supervised contrastive learning. We present a unique approach, termed Environmental Spatial Similarity (ESS), that complements existing contrastive learning methods. Using images from simulated, photorealistic environments as an experimental setting, we demonstrate that ESS outperforms traditional instance discrimination approaches. Moreover, sampling additional data from the same environment substantially improves accuracy and provides new augmentations. ESS allows remarkable proficiency in room classification and spatial prediction tasks, especially in unfamiliar environments. This learning paradigm has the potential to enable rapid visual learning in agents operating in new environments with unique visual characteristics. Potentially transformative applications span from robotics to space exploration. Our proof of concept demonstrates improved efficiency over methods that rely on extensive, disconnected datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Semi-supervised Nighttime Dehazing Baseline with Spatial-Frequency Aware and Realistic Brightness Constraint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18548v1)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing research based on deep learning has extensively explored the problem of daytime image dehazing. However, few studies have considered the characteristics of nighttime hazy scenes. There are two distinctions between nighttime and daytime haze. First, there may be multiple active colored light sources with lower illumination intensity in nighttime scenes, which may cause haze, glow and noise with localized, coupled and frequency inconsistent characteristics. Second, due to the domain discrepancy between simulated and real-world data, unrealistic brightness may occur when applying a dehazing model trained on simulated data to real-world data. To address the above two issues, we propose a semi-supervised model for real-world nighttime dehazing. First, the spatial attention and frequency spectrum filtering are implemented as a spatial-frequency domain information interaction module to handle the first issue. Second, a pseudo-label-based retraining strategy and a local window-based brightness loss for semi-supervised training process is designed to suppress haze and glow while achieving realistic brightness. Experiments on public benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

In this work we present a unified framework to predict both point-wise correspondences and shape interpolation between 3D shapes. To this end, we combine the deep functional map framework with classical surface deformation models to map shapes in both spectral and spatial domains. On the one hand, by incorporating spatial maps, our method obtains more accurate and smooth point-wise correspondences compared to previous functional map methods for shape matching. On the other hand, by introducing spectral maps, our method gets rid of commonly used but computationally expensive geodesic distance constraints that are only valid for near-isometric shape deformations. Furthermore, we propose a novel test-time adaptation scheme to capture both pose-dominant and shape-dominant deformations. Using different challenging datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods for both shape matching and interpolation, even compared to supervised approaches.</p></details> | accepted by CVPR2024 |

Existing methods often decompose 3D shapes into a sequence of localized components, treating each element in isolation without considering spatial consistency. As a result, these approaches exhibit limited versatility in 3D data representation and shape generation, hindering their ability to generate highly diverse 3D shapes that comply with the specified constraints. In this paper, we introduce a novel spatial-aware 3D shape generation framework that leverages 2D plane representations for enhanced 3D shape modeling. To ensure spatial coherence and reduce memory usage, we incorporate a hybrid shape representation technique that directly learns a continuous signed distance field representation of the 3D shape using orthogonal 2D planes. Additionally, we meticulously enforce spatial correspondences across distinct planes using a transformer-based autoencoder structure, promoting the preservation of spatial relationships in the generated 3D shapes. This yields an algorithm that consistently outperforms state-of-the-art 3D shape generation methods on various tasks, including unconditional shape generation, multi-modal shape completion, single-view reconstruction, and text-to-shape synthesis.</p></details> |  |

Spatial change of support is a key inferential problem in these applications and have become standard in univariate settings; however, it is less standard in multivariate settings. There are several existing multivariate spatial models that can be easily combined with multiscale spatial approach to analyze multivariate multiscale spatial data. In this paper, we propose three new models from such combinations for bivariate multiscale spatial data in a Bayesian context. In particular, we extend spatial random effects models, multivariate conditional autoregressive models, and ordered hierarchical models through a multiscale spatial approach. We run simulation studies for the three models and compare them in terms of prediction performance and computational efficiency. We motivate our models through an analysis of 2015 Texas annual average percentage receiving two blood tests from the Dartmouth Atlas Project.</p></details> |  |

In practice, one must select a truncation level for use. We compare five criteria for the selection of an appropriate truncation level, including AIC and BIC based on a log composite likelihood, a fraction of variance explained criterion, a fitted mean squared error, and a prediction error with one standard error rule. Based on the use of extensive simulation studies, we propose that BIC constitutes a reasonable default criterion for the selection of the truncation level for use in a spatial functional generalized linear model. In addition, we demonstrate that the spatial model with a functional covariate outperforms other models when the data contain spatial structure and response variables are in fact influenced by a functional covariate process. We apply the spatial functional generalized linear model to a problem in which the objective is to relate COVID-19 vaccination rates in counties of states in the Midwestern United States to the number of new cases from previous weeks in those same geographic regions.</p></details> |  |

We refer to generating such simultaneous movements as performing 'spatial compositions'. In contrast to temporal compositions that seek to transition from one action to another, spatial compositing requires understanding which body parts are involved in which action, to be able to move them simultaneously. Motivated by the observation that the correspondence between actions and body parts is encoded in powerful language models, we extract this knowledge by prompting GPT-3 with text such as "what are the body parts involved in the action <action name>?", while also providing the parts list and few-shot examples. Given this action-part mapping, we combine body parts from two motions together and establish the first automated method to spatially compose two actions. However, training data with compositional actions is always limited by the combinatorics. Hence, we further create synthetic data with this approach, and use it to train a new state-of-the-art text-to-motion generation model, called SINC ("SImultaneous actioN Compositions for 3D human motions"). In our experiments, that training with such GPT-guided synthetic data improves spatial composition generation over baselines.

However, existing RefSR methods are limited by the faithfulness of content reconstruction and the effectiveness of texture transfer in large scaling factors. Conditional diffusion models have opened up new opportunities for generating realistic high-resolution images, but effectively utilizing reference images within these models remains an area for further exploration. Furthermore, content fidelity is difficult to guarantee in areas without relevant reference information. To solve these issues, we propose a change-aware diffusion model named Ref-Diff for RefSR, using the land cover change priors to guide the denoising process explicitly. Specifically, we inject the priors into the denoising model to improve the utilization of reference information in unchanged areas and regulate the reconstruction of semantically relevant content in changed areas. With this powerful guidance, we decouple the semantics-guided denoising and reference texture-guided denoising processes to improve the model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method compared with state-of-the-art RefSR methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Most common indoor localization methods for human tracking technologies require expensive infrastructures, deployment and maintenance. To overcome this problem, environmental sounds have been used for infrastructure-free localization. While they achieve room-level classification, they suffer from two problems: low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) condition and non-uniqueness of sound over the coverage area. A microphone localization method was proposed using supervised spectral decomposition and spatial likelihood to solve these problems. The proposed method was evaluated with actual recordings in an experimental room with a size of 12 x 30 m. The results showed that the proposed method with supervised NMF was robust under low-SNR condition compared to a simple feature (mel frequency cepstrum coefficient: MFCC). Additionally, the proposed method could be easily integrated with prior distribution, which is available from other Bayesian localizations. The proposed method can be used to evaluate the spatial likelihood from environmental sounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, accepted to IEEE/SICE SII 2023</p></details> |

Human operators are enabled to sketch out regions directly on camera images that correspond to the objectives and constraints. These sketches are projected to 3D spatial coordinates, and continuous Spatial Instruction Maps (SIMs) are learned upon them. These maps can then be integrated into optimization problems for tasks of robots. In particular, we demonstrate how Spatial Diagrammatic Instructions can be applied to solve the Base Placement Problem of mobile manipulators, which concerns the best place to put the manipulator to facilitate a certain task. Human operators can specify, via sketch, spatial regions of interest for a manipulation task and permissible regions for the mobile manipulator to be at. Then, an optimization problem that maximizes the manipulator's reachability, or coverage, over the designated regions of interest while remaining in the permissible regions is solved. We provide extensive empirical evaluations, and show that our formulation of Spatial Instruction Maps provides accurate representations of user-specified diagrammatic instructions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our diagrammatic approach to the Mobile Base Placement Problem enables higher quality solutions and faster run-time.</p></details> |  |

However, both architectures have inherent shortcomings. Recently, the Mamba architecture, based on state space models, has shown remarkable performance in a series of natural language processing tasks, which can effectively compensate for the shortcomings of the above two architectures. In this paper, we explore for the first time the potential of the Mamba architecture for remote sensing CD tasks. We tailor the corresponding frameworks, called MambaBCD, MambaSCD, and MambaBDA, for binary change detection (BCD), semantic change detection (SCD), and building damage assessment (BDA), respectively. All three frameworks adopt the cutting-edge Visual Mamba architecture as the encoder, which allows full learning of global spatial contextual information from the input images. For the change decoder, which is available in all three architectures, we propose three spatio-temporal relationship modeling mechanisms, which can be naturally combined with the Mamba architecture and fully utilize its attribute to achieve spatio-temporal interaction of multi-temporal features, thereby obtaining accurate change information. On five benchmark datasets, our proposed frameworks outperform current CNN- and Transformer-based approaches without using any complex training strategies or tricks, fully demonstrating the potential of the Mamba architecture in CD tasks. Specifically, we obtained 83.11%, 88.39% and 94.19% F1 scores on the three BCD datasets SYSU, LEVIR-CD+, and WHU-CD; on the SCD dataset SECOND, we obtained 24.11% SeK; and on the BDA dataset xBD, we obtained 81.41% overall F1 score. Further experiments show that our architecture is quite robust to degraded data. The source code will be available in https://github.com/ChenHongruixuan/MambaCD</p></details> |  |

Addressing this distinctive attribute, we propose a Multi-Scale Spatio-temporal CNN-Transformer network (MSSTNet). Our approach takes spatial features of different scales extracted by CNN and feeds them into a Multi-scale Embedding Layer (MELayer). The MELayer extracts multi-scale spatial information and encodes these features before sending them into a Temporal Transformer (T-Former). The T-Former simultaneously extracts temporal information while continually integrating multi-scale spatial information. This process culminates in the generation of multi-scale spatio-temporal features that are utilized for the final classification. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on two in-the-wild datasets. Furthermore, a series of ablation experiments and visualizations provide further validation of our approach's proficiency in leveraging spatio-temporal information within DFER.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2024 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Low-rank Adaptation for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07919v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is crucial in real-world dynamic systems, predicting future changes using historical data from diverse locations. Existing methods often prioritize the development of intricate neural networks to capture the complex dependencies of the data, yet their accuracy fails to show sustained improvement. Besides, these methods also overlook node heterogeneity, hindering customized prediction modules from handling diverse regional nodes effectively. In this paper, our goal is not to propose a new model but to present a novel low-rank adaptation framework as an off-the-shelf plugin for existing spatial-temporal prediction models, termed ST-LoRA, which alleviates the aforementioned problems through node-level adjustments. Specifically, we first tailor a node adaptive low-rank layer comprising multiple trainable low-rank matrices. Additionally, we devise a multi-layer residual fusion stacking module, injecting the low-rank adapters into predictor modules of various models. Across six real-world traffic datasets and six different types of spatio-temporal prediction models, our approach minimally increases the parameters and training time of the original models by less than 4%, still achieving consistent and sustained performance enhancement.</p></details> |  |

The associated challenges are exacerbated when solutions to these interconnected problems need to both maximize task performance and respect practical constraints on time and resources. In this work, we formulate a new class of spatio-temporal heterogeneous task allocation problems that consider these complexities. We contribute a novel framework, named Quality-Optimized Incremental Task Allocation Graph Search (Q-ITAGS), to solve such problems. Q-ITAGS builds upon our prior work in trait-based coordination and offers a flexible interleaved framework that i) explicitly models and optimizes the effect of collective capabilities on task performance via learnable trait-quality maps, and ii) respects both resource constraints and spatio-temporal constraints, including a user-specified time budget (i.e., maximum makespan). In addition to algorithmic contributions, we derive theoretical suboptimality bounds in terms of task performance that varies as a function of a single hyperparameter. Our detailed experiments involving a simulated emergency response task and a real-world video game dataset reveal that i) Q-ITAGS results in superior team performance compared to a state-of-the-art method, while also respecting complex spatio-temporal and resource constraints, ii) Q-ITAGS efficiently learns trait-quality maps to enable effective trade-off between task performance and resource constraints, and iii) Q-ITAGS' suboptimality bounds consistently hold in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.13092</p></details> |

Specifically, in the context of estimation, we seek the most likely evolution realizing prescribed spatio-temporal marginals of stopped particles. In the context of control, we seek the control action directing the stochastic flow toward spatio-temporal probabilistic constraints. To this end, we derive a new Schr\"odinger system of coupled, in space and time, partial differential equations to construct the solution of the proposed problem. Further, we show that a Fortet-Sinkhorn type of algorithm is, once again, available to attain the associated bridge. A key feature of the framework is that the obtained bridge retains the Markovian structure in the prior process, and thereby, the corresponding control action takes the form of state feedback.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |

The restoration and enhancement have proven to be highly beneficial. However, there are only a limited number of enhancement methods explicitly designed for videos acquired in low-light conditions. We propose a Spatio-Temporal Aligned SUNet (STA-SUNet) model using a Swin Transformer as a backbone to capture low light video features and exploit their spatio-temporal correlations. The STA-SUNet model is trained on a novel, fully registered dataset (BVI), which comprises dynamic scenes captured under varying light conditions. It is further analysed comparatively against various other models over three test datasets. The model demonstrates superior adaptivity across all datasets, obtaining the highest PSNR and SSIM values. It is particularly effective in extreme low-light conditions, yielding fairly good visualisation results.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we utilize SeasFire, a comprehensive global wildfire dataset with climate, vegetation, oceanic indices, and human-related variables, to enable seasonal wildfire forecasting with machine learning. For the predictive analysis, we train deep learning models with different architectures that capture the spatio-temporal context leading to wildfires. Our investigation focuses on assessing the effectiveness of these models in predicting the presence of burned areas at varying forecasting time horizons globally, extending up to six months into the future, and on how different spatial or/and temporal context affects the performance of the models. Our findings demonstrate the great potential of deep learning models in seasonal fire forecasting; longer input time-series leads to more robust predictions across varying forecasting horizons, while integrating spatial information to capture wildfire spatio-temporal dynamics boosts performance. Finally, our results hint that in order to enhance performance at longer forecasting horizons, a larger receptive field spatially needs to be considered.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we focus on NCA models used for texture synthesis, where the update rule is inspired by partial differential equations (PDEs) describing reaction-diffusion systems. To train the NCA model, the spatio-termporal domain is discretized, and Euler integration is used to numerically simulate the PDE. However, whether a trained NCA truly learns the continuous dynamic described by the corresponding PDE or merely overfits the discretization used in training remains an open question. We study NCA models at the limit where space-time discretization approaches continuity. We find that existing NCA models tend to overfit the training discretization, especially in the proximity of the initial condition, also called "seed". To address this, we propose a solution that utilizes uniform noise as the initial condition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in preserving the consistency of NCA dynamics across a wide range of spatio-temporal granularities. Our improved NCA model enables two new test-time interactions by allowing continuous control over the speed of pattern formation and the scale of the synthesized patterns. We demonstrate this new NCA feature in our interactive online demo. Our work reveals that NCA models can learn continuous dynamics and opens new venues for NCA research from a dynamical systems' perspective.</p></details> | 9 pages, 12 figures |

However, the intricate nature of self-attention introduces practical challenges, as existing state-of-the-art methods often demand high-end GPUs or exhibit slow inference speeds, especially for high-resolution images like 2K. Striking an optimal balance between performance and latency remains a critical concern. In response, this work presents PASTA, a novel Progressively Aggregated Spatio-Temporal Alignment framework for HDR deghosting. Our approach achieves effectiveness and efficiency by harnessing hierarchical representation during feature distanglement. Through the utilization of diverse granularities within the hierarchical structure, our method substantially boosts computational speed and optimizes the HDR imaging workflow. In addition, we explore within-scale feature modeling with local and global attention, gradually merging and refining them in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Experimental results showcase PASTA's superiority over current SOTA methods in both visual quality and performance metrics, accompanied by a substantial 3-fold (x3) increase in inference speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video Anomaly Detection via Spatio-Temporal Pseudo-Anomaly Generation : A Unified Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16514v2)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is an open-set recognition task, which is usually formulated as a one-class classification (OCC) problem, where training data is comprised of videos with normal instances while test data contains both normal and anomalous instances. Recent works have investigated the creation of pseudo-anomalies (PAs) using only the normal data and making strong assumptions about real-world anomalies with regards to abnormality of objects and speed of motion to inject prior information about anomalies in an autoencoder (AE) based reconstruction model during training. This work proposes a novel method for generating generic spatio-temporal PAs by inpainting a masked out region of an image using a pre-trained Latent Diffusion Model and further perturbing the optical flow using mixup to emulate spatio-temporal distortions in the data. In addition, we present a simple unified framework to detect real-world anomalies under the OCC setting by learning three types of anomaly indicators, namely reconstruction quality, temporal irregularity and semantic inconsistency. Extensive experiments on four VAD benchmark datasets namely Ped2, Avenue, ShanghaiTech and UBnormal demonstrate that our method performs on par with other existing state-of-the-art PAs generation and reconstruction based methods under the OCC setting. Our analysis also examines the transferability and generalisation of PAs across these datasets, offering valuable insights by identifying real-world anomalies through PAs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPRW 2024 - VAND Workshop</p></details> |

Existing approaches struggle to establish effective symbolic reasoning structures, which are crucial for answering compositional spatio-temporal questions. To address this challenge, we propose a neural-symbolic framework called Neural-Symbolic VideoQA (NS-VideoQA), specifically designed for real-world VideoQA tasks. The uniqueness and superiority of NS-VideoQA are two-fold: 1) It proposes a Scene Parser Network (SPN) to transform static-dynamic video scenes into Symbolic Representation (SR), structuralizing persons, objects, relations, and action chronologies. 2) A Symbolic Reasoning Machine (SRM) is designed for top-down question decompositions and bottom-up compositional reasonings. Specifically, a polymorphic program executor is constructed for internally consistent reasoning from SR to the final answer. As a result, Our NS-VideoQA not only improves the compositional spatio-temporal reasoning in real-world VideoQA task, but also enables step-by-step error analysis by tracing the intermediate results. Experimental evaluations on the AGQA Decomp benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NS-VideoQA framework. Empirical studies further confirm that NS-VideoQA exhibits internal consistency in answering compositional questions and significantly improves the capability of spatio-temporal and logical inference for VideoQA tasks.</p></details> |  |

While contrastive learning approach is promising in addressing spatio-temporal heterogeneity, the existing methods are noneffective in determining negative pairs and can hardly apply to PFL paradigm. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel PFL method, named Federated dUal sEmantic aLignment-based contraStive learning (FUELS), which can adaptively align positive and negative pairs based on semantic similarity, thereby injecting precise spatio-temporal heterogeneity into the latent representation space by auxiliary contrastive tasks. From temporal perspective, a hard negative filtering module is introduced to dynamically align heterogeneous temporal representations for the supplemented intra-client contrastive task. From spatial perspective, we design lightweight-but-efficient prototypes as client-level semantic representations, based on which the server evaluates spatial similarity and yields client-customized global prototypes for the supplemented inter-client contrastive task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FUELS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with communication cost decreasing by around 94%.</p></details> |  |

Our key contribution is the development of user-level differentially private algorithms that incorporate carefully chosen parameter values to ensure low estimation errors on real-world datasets, while ensuring privacy. We test our algorithms on ITMS (Intelligent Traffic Management System) data from an Indian city, where the speeds of different buses are drawn in a potentially non-i.i.d. manner from an unknown distribution, and where the number of speed samples contributed by different buses is potentially different. We then apply our algorithms to large synthetic datasets, generated based on the ITMS data. Here, we provide theoretical justification for the observed performance trends, and also provide recommendations for the choices of algorithm subroutines that result in low estimation errors. Finally, we characterize the best performance of pseudo-user creation-based algorithms on worst-case datasets via a minimax approach; this then gives rise to a novel procedure for the creation of pseudo-users, which optimizes the worst-case total estimation error. The algorithms discussed in the paper are readily applicable to general spatio-temporal IoT datasets for releasing a differentially private mean of a desired value.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, to be submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Regardless of the recipient, the message space and time scale could be too fast, too slow, too large, or too small and may never be decoded. Therefore, it pays to devise a way to encode messages agnostic of space and time scales. We propose the use of fractal functions as self-executable infinite-frequency carriers for sending messages, given their properties of structural self-similarity and scale invariance. We call it `fractal messaging'. Starting from a spatial embedding, we introduce a framework for a space-time scale-free messaging approach to this challenge. When considering a space and time-agnostic framework for message transmission, it would be interesting to encode a message such that it could be decoded at several spatio-temporal scales. Hence, the core idea of the framework proposed herein is to encode a binary message as waves along infinitely many frequencies (in power-like distributions) and amplitudes, transmit such a message, and then decode and reproduce it. To do so, the components of the Weierstrass function, a known fractal, are used as carriers of the message. Each component will have its amplitude modulated to embed the binary stream, allowing for a space-time-agnostic approach to messaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages + appendix (21 pages total)</p></details> |

Its purpose is to anticipate future patterns, trends, and events in diverse facets of urban life, including transportation, population movement, and crime rates. Although numerous efforts have been dedicated to developing neural network techniques for accurate predictions on spatio-temporal data, it is important to note that many of these methods heavily depend on having sufficient labeled data to generate precise spatio-temporal representations. Unfortunately, the issue of data scarcity is pervasive in practical urban sensing scenarios. Consequently, it becomes necessary to build a spatio-temporal model with strong generalization capabilities across diverse spatio-temporal learning scenarios. Taking inspiration from the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs), our objective is to create a spatio-temporal LLM that can exhibit exceptional generalization capabilities across a wide range of downstream urban tasks. To achieve this objective, we present the UrbanGPT, which seamlessly integrates a spatio-temporal dependency encoder with the instruction-tuning paradigm. This integration enables LLMs to comprehend the complex inter-dependencies across time and space, facilitating more comprehensive and accurate predictions under data scarcity. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on various public datasets, covering different spatio-temporal prediction tasks. The results consistently demonstrate that our UrbanGPT, with its carefully designed architecture, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These findings highlight the potential of building large language models for spatio-temporal learning, particularly in zero-shot scenarios where labeled data is scarce.</p></details> | 11 pages |

This paper addresses a critical limitation in current video grounding methodologies by introducing an Open-Vocabulary Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding task. Unlike prevalent closed-set approaches that struggle with open-vocabulary scenarios due to limited training data and predefined vocabularies, our model leverages pre-trained representations from foundational spatial grounding models. This empowers it to effectively bridge the semantic gap between natural language and diverse visual content, achieving strong performance in closed-set and open-vocabulary settings. Our contributions include a novel spatio-temporal video grounding model, surpassing state-of-the-art results in closed-set evaluations on multiple datasets and demonstrating superior performance in open-vocabulary scenarios. Notably, the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in closed-set settings on VidSTG (Declarative and Interrogative) and HC-STVG (V1 and V2) datasets. Furthermore, in open-vocabulary evaluations on HC-STVG V1 and YouCook-Interactions, our model surpasses the recent best-performing models by $4.88$ m_vIoU and $1.83\%$ accuracy, demonstrating its efficacy in handling diverse linguistic and visual concepts for improved video understanding.

Dominant pipelines propose to tackle the visual discrepancies with additional temporal learners while overlooking the substantial discrepancy for web-scaled descriptive narratives and concise action category names, leading to less distinct semantic space and potential performance limitations. In this work, we prioritize the refinement of text knowledge to facilitate generalizable video recognition. To address the limitations of the less distinct semantic space of category names, we prompt a large language model (LLM) to augment action class names into Spatio-Temporal Descriptors thus bridging the textual discrepancy and serving as a knowledge base for general recognition. Moreover, to assign the best descriptors with different video instances, we propose Optimal Descriptor Solver, forming the video recognition problem as solving the optimal matching flow across frame-level representations and descriptors. Comprehensive evaluations in zero-shot, few-shot, and fully supervised video recognition highlight the effectiveness of our approach.

To correctly exploit the provided information by each sensor in a single common frame, it is essential for these sensors to be accurately calibrated. In this paper, we leverage the ability of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to represent different sensors modalities in a common volumetric representation to achieve robust and accurate spatio-temporal sensor calibration. By designing a partitioning approach based on the visible part of the scene for each sensor, we formulate the calibration problem using only the overlapping areas. This strategy results in a more robust and accurate calibration that is less prone to failure.

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel generative pre-training framework, GPD, for spatio-temporal few-shot learning with urban knowledge transfer. Unlike conventional approaches that heavily rely on common feature extraction or intricate few-shot learning designs, our solution takes a novel approach by performing generative pre-training on a collection of neural network parameters optimized with data from source cities. We recast spatio-temporal few-shot learning as pre-training a generative diffusion model, which generates tailored neural networks guided by prompts, allowing for adaptability to diverse data distributions and city-specific characteristics. GPD employs a Transformer-based denoising diffusion model, which is model-agnostic to integrate with powerful spatio-temporal neural networks. By addressing challenges arising from data gaps and the complexity of generalizing knowledge across cities, our framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on multiple real-world datasets for tasks such as traffic speed prediction and crowd flow prediction.

The accuracy of expression spotting is affected not only by irrelevant facial movements but also by the difficulty of perceiving subtle motions in micro-expressions. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (SpoT-GCN) for facial expression spotting. To extract more robust motion features, we track both short- and long-term motion of facial muscles in compact sliding windows whose window length adapts to the temporal receptive field of the network. This strategy, termed the receptive field adaptive sliding window strategy, effectively magnifies the motion features while alleviating the problem of severe head movement. The subtle motion features are then converted to a facial graph representation, whose spatio-temporal graph patterns are learned by a graph convolutional network. This network learns both local and global features from multiple scales of facial graph structures using our proposed facial local graph pooling (FLGP). Furthermore, we introduce supervised contrastive learning to enhance the discriminative capability of our model for difficult-to-classify frames. The experimental results on the SAMM-LV and CAS(ME)^2 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in micro-expression spotting. Ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of our proposed modules.</p></details> | Accepted by FG2024 |

However, existing methods, which depend solely on appearance matching via Siamese networks or utilize motion information from successive frames, encounter significant challenges. Issues such as similar objects nearby or occlusions can result in tracker drift. To mitigate these challenges, we design an innovative spatio-temporal bi-directional cross-frame distractor filtering tracker, named STMD-Tracker. Our first step involves the creation of a 4D multi-frame spatio-temporal graph convolution backbone. This design separates KNN graph spatial embedding and incorporates 1D temporal convolution, effectively capturing temporal fluctuations and spatio-temporal information. Subsequently, we devise a novel bi-directional cross-frame memory procedure. This integrates future and synthetic past frame memory to enhance the current memory, thereby improving the accuracy of iteration-based tracking. This iterative memory update mechanism allows our tracker to dynamically compensate for information in the current frame, effectively reducing tracker drift. Lastly, we construct spatially reliable Gaussian masks on the fused features to eliminate distractor points. This is further supplemented by an object-aware sampling strategy, which bolsters the efficiency and precision of object localization, thereby reducing tracking errors caused by distractors. Our extensive experiments on KITTI, NuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly surpasses the current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 18 pages,6 figures |

| **[Spatio-Temporal Proximity-Aware Dual-Path Model for Panoramic Activity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14113v1)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Panoramic Activity Recognition (PAR) seeks to identify diverse human activities across different scales, from individual actions to social group and global activities in crowded panoramic scenes. PAR presents two major challenges: 1) recognizing the nuanced interactions among numerous individuals and 2) understanding multi-granular human activities. To address these, we propose Social Proximity-aware Dual-Path Network (SPDP-Net) based on two key design principles. First, while previous works often focus on spatial distance among individuals within an image, we argue to consider the spatio-temporal proximity. It is crucial for individual relation encoding to correctly understand social dynamics. Secondly, deviating from existing hierarchical approaches (individual-to-social-to-global activity), we introduce a dual-path architecture for multi-granular activity recognition. This architecture comprises individual-to-global and individual-to-social paths, mutually reinforcing each other's task with global-local context through multiple layers. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of the spatio-temporal proximity among individuals and the dual-path architecture in PAR. Furthermore, SPDP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance with 46.5\% of overall F1 score on JRDB-PAR dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[$GRU^{spa}$: Gated Recurrent Unit with Spatial Attention for Spatio-Temporal Disaggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07292v3)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open data is frequently released spatially aggregated, usually to comply with privacy policies. But coarse, heterogeneous aggregations complicate learning and integration for downstream AI/ML systems. In this work, we consider models to disaggregate spatio-temporal data from a low-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., census tract) to a high-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., city block). We propose a model, Gated Recurrent Unit with Spatial Attention ($GRU^{spa}$), where spatial attention layers are integrated into the original Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model. The spatial attention layers capture spatial interactions among regions, while the gated recurrent module captures the temporal dependencies. Additionally, we utilize containment relationships between different geographic levels (e.g., when a given city block is wholly contained in a given census tract) to constrain the spatial attention layers. For situations where limited historical training data is available, we study transfer learning scenarios and show that a model pre-trained on one city variable can be fine-tuned for another city variable using only a few hundred samples. Evaluating these techniques on two mobility datasets, we find that $GRU^{spa}$ provides a significant improvement over other neural models as well as typical heuristic methods, allowing us to synthesize realistic point data over small regions useful for training downstream models.</p></details> |  |

Recent machine learning research efforts have focused on the application of screening various diseases using ECG signals. However, adapting to the application of screening disease is challenging in that labeled ECG data are limited. Achieving general representation through self-supervised learning (SSL) is a well-known approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data; however, a naive application of SSL to ECG data, without considering the spatial-temporal relationships inherent in ECG signals, may yield suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce ST-MEM (Spatio-Temporal Masked Electrocardiogram Modeling), designed to learn spatio-temporal features by reconstructing masked 12-lead ECG data. ST-MEM outperforms other SSL baseline methods in various experimental settings for arrhythmia classification tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that ST-MEM is adaptable to various lead combinations. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we show a spatio-temporal relationship within ECG data.

In the upstream stage, we design a vector quantization reconstruction module with temporal evolution characteristics, ensuring balanced and resilient parameter distribution by introducing general physical constraints. In the downstream stage, a diffusion probability network involving parameters is utilized to generate high-quality future states of fluids, while enhancing the model's generalization ability by perceiving parameters in various physical setups. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets have verified the effectiveness and robustness of the ST-PAD framework, which showcase that ST-PAD outperforms current mainstream models in fluid dynamics modeling and prediction, especially in effectively capturing local representations and maintaining significant advantages in OOD generations.</p></details> |  |

Existing geo-textual indexes for TkQs use traditional retrieval models like BM25 to compute text relevance and usually exploit a simple linear function to compute spatial relevance, but its effectiveness is limited. To improve effectiveness, several deep learning models have recently been proposed, but they suffer severe efficiency issues. To the best of our knowledge, there are no efficient indexes specifically designed to accelerate the top-k search process for these deep learning models. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel technique, which Learns to Index the Spatio-Textual data for answering embedding based spatial keyword queries (called LIST). LIST is featured with two novel components. Firstly, we propose a lightweight and effective relevance model that is capable of learning both textual and spatial relevance. Secondly, we introduce a novel machine learning based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) index, which utilizes a new learning-to-cluster technique to group relevant queries and objects together while separating irrelevant queries and objects. Two key challenges in building an effective and efficient index are the absence of high-quality labels and unbalanced clustering results. We develop a novel pseudo-label generation technique to address the two challenges. Experimental results show that LIST significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on effectiveness, with improvements up to 19.21% and 12.79% in terms of NDCG@1 and Recall@10, and is three orders of magnitude faster than the most effective baseline.</p></details> |  |

Our focus lies in the parametric estimation of its intensity function, incorporating both spatial factors (such as altitude) and spatio-temporal covariates (such as field temperature, precipitation, etc.). The events are observed in France over a span of three years. Spatio-temporal covariates are observed with resolution $0.1^\circ \times 0.1^\circ$ ($\approx 100$km$^2$) and six-hour periods. This results in an extensive dataset, further characterized by a significant excess of zeroes (i.e., spatio-temporal cells with no observed events). We reexamine composite likelihood methods commonly employed for spatial point processes, especially in situations where covariates are piecewise constant. Additionally, we extend these methods to account for zero-deflated subsampling, a strategy involving dependent subsampling, with a focus on selecting more cells in regions where events are observed. A simulation study is conducted to illustrate these novel methodologies, followed by their application to the dataset of lightning strikes.</p></details> |  |

It automatically decomposes the given task into smaller, more manageable subtasks, and thus enables sparse decision-making and focused computation on the relevant parts of the environment. The decomposition relies on the extraction of an abstracted proxy problem represented as a directed graph, in which vertices and edges are learned end-to-end from hindsight. Our theoretical analyses provide performance guarantees under appropriate assumptions and establish where our approach is expected to be helpful. Generalization-focused experiments validate Skipper's significant advantage in zero-shot generalization, compared to some existing state-of-the-art hierarchical planning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2024 Camera-Ready</p></details> |

However, the presence of anomalies can compromise the accuracy and reliability of insights drawn from the collected data or information obtained via statistical analysis. This study aims to develop a robust Bayesian optimal experimental design (BOED) framework with anomaly detection methods for high-quality data collection. We introduce a general framework that involves anomaly generation, detection and error scoring when searching for an optimal design. This method is demonstrated using two comprehensive simulated case studies: the first study uses a spatial dataset, and the second uses a spatio-temporal river network dataset. As a baseline approach, we employed a commonly used prediction-based utility function based on minimising errors. Results illustrate the trade-off between predictive accuracy and anomaly detection performance for our method under various design scenarios. An optimal design robust to anomalies ensures the collection and analysis of more trustworthy data, playing a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of complex systems such as the environment, therefore enabling informed decisions in monitoring, management, and response.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal Occupancy Models with INLA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10680v1)** | 2024-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern methods for quantifying and predicting species distribution play a crucial part in biodiversity conservation. Occupancy models are a popular choice for analyzing species occurrence data as they allow to separate the observational error induced by imperfect detection, and the sources of bias affecting the occupancy process. However, the spatial and temporal variation in occupancy not accounted for by environmental covariates is often ignored or modelled through simple spatial structures as the computational costs of fitting explicit spatio-temporal models is too high. In this work, we demonstrate how INLA may be used to fit complex occupancy models and how the R-INLA package can provide a user-friendly interface to make such complex models available to users. We show how occupancy models, provided some simplification on the detection process, can be framed as latent Gaussian models and benefit from the powerful INLA machinery. A large selection of complex modelling features, and random effect modelshave already been implemented in R-INLA. These become available for occupancy models, providing the user with an efficient and flexible toolbox. We illustrate how INLA provides a computationally efficient framework for developing and fitting complex occupancy models using two case studies. Through these, we show how different spatio-temporal models that include spatial-varying trends, smooth terms, and spatio-temporal random effects can be fitted. At the cost of limiting the complexity of the detection model, INLA can incorporate a range of complex structures in the process. INLA-based occupancy models provide an alternative framework to fit complex spatiotemporal occupancy models. The need for new and more flexible computationally approaches to fit such models makes INLA an attractive option for addressing complex ecological problems, and a promising area of research.</p></details> |  |

However, estimating incidence or mortality rates associated with rare cancers presents important difficulties and poses new statistical methodological challenges. In this paper, we expand the collection of multivariate spatio-temporal models by introducing adaptable shared interactions to enable a comprehensive analysis of both incidence and cancer mortality in rare cancer cases. These models allow the modulation of spatio-temporal interactions between incidence and mortality, allowing for changes in their relationship over time. The new models have been implemented in INLA using r-generic constructions. We conduct a simulation study to evaluate the performance of the new spatio-temporal models in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Results show that multivariate spatio-temporal models with flexible shared interaction outperform conventional multivariate spatio-temporal models with independent interactions. We use these models to analyze incidence and mortality data for pancreatic cancer and leukaemia among males across 142 administrative healthcare districts of Great Britain over a span of nine biennial periods (2002-2019).</p></details> | 39 pages, 12 figures |

The Segment Anything Model (SAM), known for its accurate segmentation and zero-shot generalization, has not yet been tailored for CMR 2D+T segmentation. We therefore introduce CMR2D+T-SAM, a novel approach to adapt SAM for CMR 2D+T segmentation using spatio-temporal adaption. This approach also incorporates a U-Net framework for multi-scale feature extraction, as well as text prompts for accurate segmentation on both short-axis (SAX) and long-axis (LAX) views using a single model. CMR2D+T-SAM outperforms existing deep learning methods on the STACOM2011 dataset, achieving a myocardium Dice score of 0.885 and a Hausdorff distance (HD) of 2.900 pixels. It also demonstrates superior zero-shot generalization on the ACDC dataset with a Dice score of 0.840 and a HD of 4.076 pixels.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Autoregressive Queries for Adaptive Tracking with Spatio-TemporalTransformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10574v1)** | 2024-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rich spatio-temporal information is crucial to capture the complicated target appearance variations in visual tracking. However, most top-performing tracking algorithms rely on many hand-crafted components for spatio-temporal information aggregation. Consequently, the spatio-temporal information is far away from being fully explored. To alleviate this issue, we propose an adaptive tracker with spatio-temporal transformers (named AQATrack), which adopts simple autoregressive queries to effectively learn spatio-temporal information without many hand-designed components. Firstly, we introduce a set of learnable and autoregressive queries to capture the instantaneous target appearance changes in a sliding window fashion. Then, we design a novel attention mechanism for the interaction of existing queries to generate a new query in current frame. Finally, based on the initial target template and learnt autoregressive queries, a spatio-temporal information fusion module (STM) is designed for spatiotemporal formation aggregation to locate a target object. Benefiting from the STM, we can effectively combine the static appearance and instantaneous changes to guide robust tracking. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves the tracker's performance on six popular tracking benchmarks: LaSOT, LaSOText, TrackingNet, GOT-10k, TNL2K, and UAV123.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal methods for estimating subsurface ocean thermal response to tropical cyclones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15130v5)** | 2024-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tropical cyclones (TCs), driven by heat exchange between the air and sea, pose a substantial risk to many communities around the world. Accurate characterization of the subsurface ocean thermal response to TC passage is crucial for accurate TC intensity forecasts and for an understanding of the role that TCs play in the global climate system. However, that characterization is complicated by the high-noise ocean environment, correlations inherent in spatio-temporal data, relative scarcity of in situ observations, and the entanglement of the TC-induced signal with seasonal signals. We present a general methodological framework that addresses these difficulties, integrating existing techniques in seasonal mean field estimation, Gaussian process modeling, and nonparametric regression into an ANOVA decomposition model. Importantly, we improve upon past work by properly handling seasonality, providing rigorous uncertainty quantification, and treating time as a continuous variable, rather than producing estimates that are binned in time. This ANOVA model is estimated using in situ subsurface temperature profiles from the Argo fleet of autonomous floats through a multi-step procedure, which (1) characterizes the upper ocean seasonal shift during the TC season; (2) models the variability in the temperature observations; (3) fits a thin plate spline using the variability estimates to account for heteroskedasticity and correlation between the observations. This spline fit reveals the ocean thermal response to TC passage. Through this framework, we obtain new scientific insights into the interaction between TCs and the ocean on a global scale, including a three-dimensional characterization of the near-surface and subsurface cooling along the TC storm track and the mixing-induced subsurface warming on the track's right side.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 14 figures; supplement and code at https://github.com/huisaddison/tc-ocean-methods</p></details> |

During training, CINA learns a general representation of the fetal brain and encodes subject specific information into latent code. After training, CINA can construct a faithful atlas with tissue probability maps of the fetal brain for any gestational age (GA) and anatomical variation covered within the training domain. Thus, CINA is competent to represent both, neurotypical and pathological brains. Furthermore, a trained CINA model can be fit to brain MRI of unseen subjects via test-time optimization of the latent code. CINA can then produce probabilistic tissue maps tailored to a particular subject. We evaluate our method on a total of 198 T2 weighted MRI of normal and abnormal fetal brains from the dHCP and FeTA datasets. We demonstrate CINA's capability to represent a fetal brain atlas that can be flexibly conditioned on GA and on anatomical variations like ventricular volume or degree of cortical folding, making it a suitable tool for modeling both neurotypical and pathological brains. We quantify the fidelity of our atlas by means of tissue segmentation and age prediction and compare it to an established baseline. CINA demonstrates superior accuracy for neurotypical brains and pathological brains with ventriculomegaly. Moreover, CINA scores a mean absolute error of 0.23 weeks in fetal brain age prediction, further confirming an accurate representation of fetal brain development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to MICCAI 2024</p></details> |

It is based on discerning and synchronizing the process signatures of salient kinematic and dynamic events in these disparate signals. HiRA-Pro addresses the challenge of aligning data with sub-millisecond phenomena, where traditional timestamp, external trigger, or clock-based alignment methods fall short. The effectiveness of HiRA-Pro is demonstrated in a smart manufacturing context, where it aligns data from 13+ channels acquired during 3D-printing and milling operations on an Optomec-LENS MTS 500 hybrid machine. The aligned data is then voxelized to generate 0.25 second aligned data chunks that correspond to physical voxels on the produced part. The superiority of HiRA-Pro is further showcased through case studies in additive manufacturing, demonstrating improved machine learning-based predictive performance due to precise multimodal data alignment. Specifically, testing classification accuracies improved by almost 35% with the application of HiRA-Pro, even with limited data, allowing for precise localization of artifacts. The paper also provides a comprehensive discussion on the proposed method, its applications, and comparative qualitative analysis with a few other alignment methods. HiRA-Pro achieves temporal-spatial resolutions of 10-1000 us and 100 um in order to generate datasets that register with physical voxels on the 3D-printed and milled part. These resolutions are at least an order of magnitude finer than the existing alignment methods that employ individual timestamps, statistical correlations, or common clocks, which achieve precision of hundreds of milliseconds.</p></details> |  |
| **[JSTR: Joint Spatio-Temporal Reasoning for Event-based Moving Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07436v1)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based moving object detection is a challenging task, where static background and moving object are mixed together. Typically, existing methods mainly align the background events to the same spatial coordinate system via motion compensation to distinguish the moving object. However, they neglect the potential spatial tailing effect of moving object events caused by excessive motion, which may affect the structure integrity of the extracted moving object. We discover that the moving object has a complete columnar structure in the point cloud composed of motion-compensated events along the timestamp. Motivated by this, we propose a novel joint spatio-temporal reasoning method for event-based moving object detection. Specifically, we first compensate the motion of background events using inertial measurement unit. In spatial reasoning stage, we project the compensated events into the same image coordinate, discretize the timestamp of events to obtain a time image that can reflect the motion confidence, and further segment the moving object through adaptive threshold on the time image. In temporal reasoning stage, we construct the events into a point cloud along timestamp, and use RANSAC algorithm to extract the columnar shape in the cloud for peeling off the background. Finally, we fuse the results from the two reasoning stages to extract the final moving object region. This joint spatio-temporal reasoning framework can effectively detect the moving object from motion confidence and geometric structure. Moreover, we conduct extensive experiments on various datasets to verify that the proposed method can improve the moving object detection accuracy by 13\%.</p></details> |  |

This theoretical result can be employed as an estimation method to derive parameter estimates for a particular model assumed for the data. The underlying motivation is to avoid the difficulties associated with dealing with complex likelihoods in point process models and their maximization. The exploited result makes our method theoretically applicable to any model specification. In this paper, we restrict our study to Poisson models, whose likelihood represents the base for many more complex point process models. In this context, our proposed method can estimate the vector of local parameters that correspond to the points within the analyzed point pattern without introducing any additional complexity compared to the global estimation. We illustrate the method through simulation studies for both purely spatial and spatio-temporal point processes and show complex scenarios based on the Poisson model through the analysis of two real datasets concerning environmental problems.</p></details> |  |

Tangible cubes, with their rich interaction affordances, high maneuverability, and stable structure, are particularly well-suited for exploring multi-dimensional data types. However, the design potential of these cubes is underexplored. This study introduces a design space for tangible cubes in MR, focusing on interaction space, visualization space, sizes, and multiplicity. Using spatio-temporal data, we explored the interaction affordances of these cubes in a workshop (N=24). We identified unique interactions like rotating, tapping, and stacking, which are linked to augmented reality (AR) visualization commands. Integrating user-identified interactions, we created a design space for tangible-cube interactions and visualization. A prototype visualizing global health spending with small cubes was developed and evaluated, supporting both individual and combined cube manipulation. This research enhances our grasp of tangible interaction in MR, offering insights for future design and application in diverse data contexts.</p></details> |  |

Temporal localization is challenging because it requires robustness, reliability, and accuracy. In this study, we aim to improve the temporal localization and classification accuracy performance by adapting video action recognition and 2D human-pose estimation networks to one model. Therefore, we design a transformer-based fusion architecture to effectively combine 2D-pose features and spatio-temporal features. The model uses 2D-pose features as the positional embedding of the transformer architecture and spatio-temporal features as the main input to the encoder of the transformer. The proposed solution is generic and independent of the camera numbers and positions, giving frame-based class probabilities as output. Finally, the post-processing step combines information from different camera views to obtain final predictions and eliminate false positives. The model performs well on the A2 test set of the 2023 NVIDIA AI City Challenge for naturalistic driving action recognition, achieving the overlap score of the organizer-defined distracted driver behaviour metric of 0.5079.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Grained Pillar Feature Encoding Via Spatio-Temporal Virtual Grid for 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06433v1)** | 2024-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing high-performance, real-time architectures for LiDAR-based 3D object detectors is essential for the successful commercialization of autonomous vehicles. Pillar-based methods stand out as a practical choice for onboard deployment due to their computational efficiency. However, despite their efficiency, these methods can sometimes underperform compared to alternative point encoding techniques such as Voxel-encoding or PointNet++. We argue that current pillar-based methods have not sufficiently captured the fine-grained distributions of LiDAR points within each pillar structure. Consequently, there exists considerable room for improvement in pillar feature encoding. In this paper, we introduce a novel pillar encoding architecture referred to as Fine-Grained Pillar Feature Encoding (FG-PFE). FG-PFE utilizes Spatio-Temporal Virtual (STV) grids to capture the distribution of point clouds within each pillar across vertical, temporal, and horizontal dimensions. Through STV grids, points within each pillar are individually encoded using Vertical PFE (V-PFE), Temporal PFE (T-PFE), and Horizontal PFE (H-PFE). These encoded features are then aggregated through an Attentive Pillar Aggregation method. Our experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that FG-PFE achieves significant performance improvements over baseline models such as PointPillar, CenterPoint-Pillar, and PillarNet, with only a minor increase in computational overhead.</p></details> | ICRA 2024 |

However, existing ST models often require region partition as a prerequisite, resulting in two main pitfalls. Firstly, location-based services necessitate ad-hoc regions for various purposes, requiring multiple ST models with varying scales and zones, which can be costly to support. Secondly, different ST models may produce conflicting outputs, resulting in confusing predictions. In this paper, we propose One4All-ST, a framework that can conduct ST prediction for arbitrary modifiable areal units using only one model. To reduce the cost of getting multi-scale predictions, we design an ST network with hierarchical spatial modeling and scale normalization modules to efficiently and equally learn multi-scale representations. To address prediction inconsistencies across scales, we propose a dynamic programming scheme to solve the formulated optimal combination problem, minimizing predicted error through theoretical analysis. Besides, we suggest using an extended quad-tree to index the optimal combinations for quick response to arbitrary modifiable areal units in practical online scenarios.

| **[DiffSTG: Probabilistic Spatio-Temporal Graph Forecasting with Denoising Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13629v4)** | 2024-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNN) have emerged as the dominant model for spatio-temporal graph (STG) forecasting. Despite their success, they fail to model intrinsic uncertainties within STG data, which cripples their practicality in downstream tasks for decision-making. To this end, this paper focuses on probabilistic STG forecasting, which is challenging due to the difficulty in modeling uncertainties and complex ST dependencies. In this study, we present the first attempt to generalize the popular denoising diffusion probabilistic models to STGs, leading to a novel non-autoregressive framework called DiffSTG, along with the first denoising network UGnet for STG in the framework. Our approach combines the spatio-temporal learning capabilities of STGNNs with the uncertainty measurements of diffusion models. Extensive experiments validate that DiffSTG reduces the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) by 4%-14%, and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) by 2%-7% over existing methods on three real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 31st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems</p></details> |
| **[Extraction and Recovery of Spatio-Temporal Structure in Latent Dynamics Alignment with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06138v2)** | 2024-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of behavior-related brain computation, it is necessary to align raw neural signals against the drastic domain shift among them. A foundational framework within neuroscience research posits that trial-based neural population activities rely on low-dimensional latent dynamics, thus focusing on the latter greatly facilitates the alignment procedure. Despite this field's progress, existing methods ignore the intrinsic spatio-temporal structure during the alignment phase. Hence, their solutions usually lead to poor quality in latent dynamics structures and overall performance. To tackle this problem, we propose an alignment method ERDiff, which leverages the expressivity of the diffusion model to preserve the spatio-temporal structure of latent dynamics. Specifically, the latent dynamics structures of the source domain are first extracted by a diffusion model. Then, under the guidance of this diffusion model, such structures are well-recovered through a maximum likelihood alignment procedure in the target domain. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on a synthetic dataset. Then, when applied to neural recordings from the non-human primate motor cortex, under both cross-day and inter-subject settings, our method consistently manifests its capability of preserving the spatiotemporal structure of latent dynamics and outperforms existing approaches in alignment goodness-of-fit and neural decoding performance.</p></details> |  |

| **[Multi-Factor Spatio-Temporal Prediction based on Graph Decomposition Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10374v2)** | 2024-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal (ST) prediction is an important and widely used technique in data mining and analytics, especially for ST data in urban systems such as transportation data. In practice, the ST data generation is usually influenced by various latent factors tied to natural phenomena or human socioeconomic activities, impacting specific spatial areas selectively. However, existing ST prediction methods usually do not refine the impacts of different factors, but directly model the entangled impacts of multiple factors. This amplifies the modeling complexity of ST data and compromises model interpretability. To this end, we propose a multi-factor ST prediction task that predicts partial ST data evolution under different factors, and combines them for a final prediction. We make two contributions to this task: an effective theoretical solution and a portable instantiation framework. Specifically, we first propose a theoretical solution called decomposed prediction strategy and prove its effectiveness from the perspective of information entropy theory. On top of that, we instantiate a novel model-agnostic framework, named spatio-temporal graph decomposition learning (STGDL), for multi-factor ST prediction. The framework consists of two main components: an automatic graph decomposition module that decomposes the original graph structure inherent in ST data into subgraphs corresponding to different factors, and a decomposed learning network that learns the partial ST data on each subgraph separately and integrates them for the final prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world ST datasets of two types of graphs, i.e., grid graph and network graph. Results show that our framework significantly reduces prediction errors of various ST models by 9.41% on average (35.36% at most). Furthermore, a case study reveals the interpretability potential of our framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervised Deconfounding Against Spatio-Temporal Shifts: Theory and Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12472v2)** | 2024-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As an important application of spatio-temporal (ST) data, ST traffic forecasting plays a crucial role in improving urban travel efficiency and promoting sustainable development. In practice, the dynamics of traffic data frequently undergo distributional shifts attributed to external factors such as time evolution and spatial differences. This entails forecasting models to handle the out-of-distribution (OOD) issue where test data is distributed differently from training data. In this work, we first formalize the problem by constructing a causal graph of past traffic data, future traffic data, and external ST contexts. We reveal that the failure of prior arts in OOD traffic data is due to ST contexts acting as a confounder, i.e., the common cause for past data and future ones. Then, we propose a theoretical solution named Disentangled Contextual Adjustment (DCA) from a causal lens. It differentiates invariant causal correlations against variant spurious ones and deconfounds the effect of ST contexts. On top of that, we devise a Spatio-Temporal sElf-superVised dEconfounding (STEVE) framework. It first encodes traffic data into two disentangled representations for associating invariant and variant ST contexts. Then, we use representative ST contexts from three conceptually different perspectives (i.e., temporal, spatial, and semantic) as self-supervised signals to inject context information into both representations. In this way, we improve the generalization ability of the learned context-oriented representations to OOD ST traffic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on four large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate that our STEVE consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines across various ST OOD scenarios.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Self-Supervised Learning for Traffic Flow Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04475v2)** | 2024-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust prediction of citywide traffic flows at different time periods plays a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. While previous work has made great efforts to model spatio-temporal correlations, existing methods still suffer from two key limitations: i) Most models collectively predict all regions' flows without accounting for spatial heterogeneity, i.e., different regions may have skewed traffic flow distributions. ii) These models fail to capture the temporal heterogeneity induced by time-varying traffic patterns, as they typically model temporal correlations with a shared parameterized space for all time periods. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Self-Supervised Learning (ST-SSL) traffic prediction framework which enhances the traffic pattern representations to be reflective of both spatial and temporal heterogeneity, with auxiliary self-supervised learning paradigms. Specifically, our ST-SSL is built over an integrated module with temporal and spatial convolutions for encoding the information across space and time. To achieve the adaptive spatio-temporal self-supervised learning, our ST-SSL first performs the adaptive augmentation over the traffic flow graph data at both attribute- and structure-levels. On top of the augmented traffic graph, two SSL auxiliary tasks are constructed to supplement the main traffic prediction task with spatial and temporal heterogeneity-aware augmentation. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SSL consistently outperforms various state-of-the-art baselines. Since spatio-temporal heterogeneity widely exists in practical datasets, the proposed framework may also cast light on other spatial-temporal applications. Model implementation is available at https://github.com/Echo-Ji/ST-SSL.</p></details> | <details><summary>37th ...</summary><p>37th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2023)</p></details> |

Concretely, earth science systems rely heavily on the extensive deployment of sensors, however, the data collection from sensors is constrained by complex geographical and social factors, making it challenging to achieve comprehensive coverage and uniform deployment. To alleviate the obstacle, traditional approaches to sensor deployment utilize specific algorithms to design and deploy sensors. These methods dynamically adjust the activation times of sensors to optimize the detection process across each sub-region. Regrettably, formulating an activation strategy generally based on historical observations and geographic characteristics, which make the methods and resultant models were neither simple nor practical. Worse still, the complex technical design may ultimately lead to a model with weak generalizability. In this paper, we introduce for the first time the concept of spatio-temporal data dynamic sparse training and are committed to adaptively, dynamically filtering important sensor distributions. To our knowledge, this is the first proposal (termed DynST) of an industry-level deployment optimization concept at the data level. However, due to the existence of the temporal dimension, pruning of spatio-temporal data may lead to conflicts at different timestamps. To achieve this goal, we employ dynamic merge technology, along with ingenious dimensional mapping to mitigate potential impacts caused by the temporal aspect. During the training process, DynST utilize iterative pruning and sparse training, repeatedly identifying and dynamically removing sensor perception areas that contribute the least to future predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Spatio-Temporal State Estimation for Fine-grained Adaptive Anomaly Diagnosis of Industrial Cyber-physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02616v1)** | 2024-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate detection and diagnosis of abnormal behaviors such as network attacks from multivariate time series (MTS) are crucial for ensuring the stable and effective operation of industrial cyber-physical systems (CPS). However, existing researches pay little attention to the logical dependencies among system working states, and have difficulties in explaining the evolution mechanisms of abnormal signals. To reveal the spatio-temporal association relationships and evolution mechanisms of the working states of industrial CPS, this paper proposes a fine-grained adaptive anomaly diagnosis method (i.e. MAD-Transformer) to identify and diagnose anomalies in MTS. MAD-Transformer first constructs a temporal state matrix to characterize and estimate the change patterns of the system states in the temporal dimension. Then, to better locate the anomalies, a spatial state matrix is also constructed to capture the inter-sensor state correlation relationships within the system. Subsequently, based on these two types of state matrices, a three-branch structure of series-temporal-spatial attention module is designed to simultaneously capture the series, temporal, and space dependencies among MTS. Afterwards, three associated alignment loss functions and a reconstruction loss are constructed to jointly optimize the model. Finally, anomalies are determined and diagnosed by comparing the residual matrices with the original matrices. We conducted comparative experiments on five publicly datasets spanning three application domains (service monitoring, spatial and earth exploration, and water treatment), along with a petroleum refining simulation dataset collected by ourselves. The results demonstrate that MAD-Transformer can adaptively detect fine-grained anomalies with short duration, and outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of noise robustness and localization performance.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |

Recent works mainly focus on dynamic spatial modeling with adaptive graph embedding or graph attention having less consideration for temporal characteristics and in-situ modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning model named TESTAM, which individually models recurring and non-recurring traffic patterns by a mixture-of-experts model with three experts on temporal modeling, spatio-temporal modeling with static graph, and dynamic spatio-temporal dependency modeling with dynamic graph. By introducing different experts and properly routing them, TESTAM could better model various circumstances, including spatially isolated nodes, highly related nodes, and recurring and non-recurring events. For the proper routing, we reformulate a gating problem into a classification problem with pseudo labels. Experimental results on three public traffic network datasets, METR-LA, PEMS-BAY, and EXPY-TKY, demonstrate that TESTAM achieves a better indication and modeling of recurring and non-recurring traffic.

Considering the sparsity of data due to the high maintenance cost of the stations, good inference algorithms can effectively save the cost and refine the data granularity. While spatio-temporal graph neural networks have made excellent progress on this problem, their non-Euclidean and discrete data structure modeling of reality limits its potential. In this work, we make the first attempt to combine two different spatio-temporal perspectives, fields and graphs, by proposing a new model, Spatio-Temporal Field Neural Network, and its corresponding new framework, Pyramidal Inference. Extensive experiments validate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in nationwide air quality inference in the Chinese Mainland, demonstrating the superiority of our proposed model and framework.</p></details> |  |

This problem has received ever-increasing attention in various scenarios and facilitated the development of numerous downstream applications such as urban planning and transportation management. However, the efficacy of existing methods remains sub-optimal due to their tendency to model temporal and spatial relationships independently, thereby inadequately accounting for complex high-order interactions of both worlds. Moreover, the diversity of transitional patterns in traffic forecasting makes them challenging to capture for existing approaches, warranting a deeper exploration of their diversity. Toward this end, this paper proposes Conjoint Spatio-Temporal graph neural network (abbreviated as COOL), which models heterogeneous graphs from prior and posterior information to conjointly capture high-order spatio-temporal relationships. On the one hand, heterogeneous graphs connecting sequential observation are constructed to extract composite spatio-temporal relationships via prior message passing. On the other hand, we model dynamic relationships using constructed affinity and penalty graphs, which guide posterior message passing to incorporate complementary semantic information into node representations. Moreover, to capture diverse transitional properties to enhance traffic forecasting, we propose a conjoint self-attention decoder that models diverse temporal patterns from both multi-rank and multi-scale views. Experimental results on four popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed COOL provides state-of-the-art performance compared with the competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Information Fusion 2024</p></details> |

Developers of tools for performing high-throughput phenotyping are, however, constrained by the availability of relevant datasets on which to perform validation. To this end, we present a spatio-temporal dataset of 3D point clouds of strawberry plants for two varieties, totalling 84 individual point clouds. We focus on the end use of such tools - the extraction of biologically relevant phenotypes - and demonstrate a phenotyping pipeline on the dataset. This comprises of the steps, including; segmentation, skeletonisation and tracking, and we detail how each stage facilitates the extraction of different phenotypes or provision of data insights. We particularly note that assessment is focused on the validation of phenotypes, extracted from the representations acquired at each step of the pipeline, rather than singularly focusing on assessing the representation itself. Therefore, where possible, we provide \textit{in silico} ground truth baselines for the phenotypes extracted at each step and introduce methodology for the quantitative assessment of skeletonisation and the length trait extracted thereof. This dataset contributes to the corpus of freely available agricultural/horticultural spatio-temporal data for the development of next-generation phenotyping tools, increasing the number of plant varieties available for research in this field and providing a basis for genuine comparison of new phenotyping methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal reconstruction of substance dynamics using compressed sensing in multi-spectral magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00402v1)** | 2024-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The objective of our study is to observe dynamics of multiple substances in vivo with high temporal resolution from multi-spectral magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) data. The multi-spectral MRSI can effectively separate spectral peaks of multiple substances and is useful to measure spatial distributions of substances. However it is difficult to measure time-varying substance distributions directly by ordinary full sampling because the measurement requires a significantly long time. In this study, we propose a novel method to reconstruct the spatio-temporal distributions of substances from randomly undersampled multi-spectral MRSI data on the basis of compressed sensing (CS) and the partially separable function model with base spectra of substances. In our method, we have employed spatio-temporal sparsity and temporal smoothness of the substance distributions as prior knowledge to perform CS. The effectiveness of our method has been evaluated using phantom data sets of glass tubes filled with glucose or lactate solution in increasing amounts over time and animal data sets of a tumor-bearing mouse to observe the metabolic dynamics involved in the Warburg effect in vivo. The reconstructed results are consistent with the expected behaviors, showing that our method can reconstruct the spatio-temporal distribution of substances with a temporal resolution of four seconds which is extremely short time scale compared with that of full sampling. Since this method utilizes only prior knowledge naturally assumed for the spatio-temporal distributions of substances and is independent of the number of the spectral and spatial dimensions or the acquisition sequence of MRSI, it is expected to contribute to revealing the underlying substance dynamics in MRSI data already acquired or to be acquired in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Bayesian approach to uncover spatio-temporal determinants of heterogeneity in repeated cross-sectional health surveys](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19162v1)** | 2024-02-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In several countries, including Italy, a prominent approach to population health surveillance involves conducting repeated cross-sectional surveys at short intervals of time. These surveys gather information on the health status of individual respondents, including details on their behaviors, risk factors, and relevant socio-demographic information. While the collected data undoubtedly provides valuable information, modeling such data presents several challenges. For instance, in health risk models, it is essential to consider behavioral information, spatio-temporal dynamics, and disease co-occurrence. In response to these challenges, our work proposes a multivariate spatio-temporal logistic model for chronic disease diagnoses. Predictors are modeled using individual risk factor covariates and a latent individual propensity to the disease. Leveraging a state space formulation of the model, we construct a framework in which spatio-temporal heterogeneity in regression parameters is informed by exogenous spatial information, corresponding to different spatial contextual risk factors that may affect health and the occurrence of chronic diseases in different ways. To explore the utility and the effectiveness of our method, we analyze behavioral and risk factor surveillance data collected in Italy (PASSI), which is well-known as a country characterized by high peculiar administrative, social and territorial diversities reflected on high variability in morbidity among population subgroups.</p></details> |  |

It has been demonstrated that a transformer-based entropy model is of critical importance for achieving a high compression ratio, however, at the expense of a significant computational effort. In this work, we introduce the Efficient Contextformer (eContextformer) - a computationally efficient transformer-based autoregressive context model for learned image compression. The eContextformer efficiently fuses the patch-wise, checkered, and channel-wise grouping techniques for parallel context modeling, and introduces a shifted window spatio-channel attention mechanism. We explore better training strategies and architectural designs and introduce additional complexity optimizations. During decoding, the proposed optimization techniques dynamically scale the attention span and cache the previous attention computations, drastically reducing the model and runtime complexity. Compared to the non-parallel approach, our proposal has ~145x lower model complexity and ~210x faster decoding speed, and achieves higher average bit savings on Kodak, CLIC2020, and Tecnick datasets. Additionally, the low complexity of our context model enables online rate-distortion algorithms, which further improve the compression performance. We achieve up to 17% bitrate savings over the intra coding of Versatile Video Coding (VVC) Test Model (VTM) 16.2 and surpass various learning-based compression models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for IEEE TCSVT (14 pages, 10 figures, 9 tables)</p></details> |

Existing methods track by appearance-based similarity or long-term relation modeling, resulting in rich temporal contexts between consecutive frames being easily overlooked. Moreover, training trackers from scratch or fine-tuning large pre-trained models needs more time and memory consumption. In this paper, we present ACTrack, a new tracking framework with additive spatio-temporal conditions. It preserves the quality and capabilities of the pre-trained Transformer backbone by freezing its parameters, and makes a trainable lightweight additive net to model spatio-temporal relations in tracking. We design an additive siamese convolutional network to ensure the integrity of spatial features and perform temporal sequence modeling to simplify the tracking pipeline. Experimental results on several benchmarks prove that ACTrack could balance training efficiency and tracking performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transforming Norm-based To Graph-based Spatial Representation for Spatio-Temporal Epidemiological Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14539v2)** | 2024-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pandemics, with their profound societal and economic impacts, pose significant threats to global health, mortality rates, economic stability, and political landscapes. In response to these challenges, numerous studies have employed spatio-temporal models to enhance our understanding and management of these complex phenomena. These spatio-temporal models can be roughly divided into two main spatial categories: norm-based and graph-based. Norm-based models are usually more accurate and easier to model but are more computationally intensive and require more data to fit. On the other hand, graph-based models are less accurate and harder to model but are less computationally intensive and require fewer data to fit. As such, ideally, one would like to use a graph-based model while preserving the representation accuracy obtained by the norm-based model. In this study, we explore the ability to transform from norm-based to graph-based spatial representation for these models. We first show no analytical mapping between the two exists, requiring one to use approximation numerical methods instead. We introduce a novel framework for this task together with twelve possible implementations using a wide range of heuristic optimization approaches. Our findings show that by leveraging agent-based simulations and heuristic algorithms for the graph node's location and population's spatial walk dynamics approximation one can use graph-based spatial representation without losing much of the model's accuracy and expressiveness. We investigate our framework for three real-world cases, achieving 94\% accuracy preservation, on average. Moreover, an analysis of synthetic cases shows the proposed framework is relatively robust for changes in both spatial and temporal properties.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a Context-based Interpretable Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (CIST-GCN), as an efficient 3D human pose forecasting model based on GCNs that encompasses specific layers, aiding model interpretability and providing information that might be useful when analyzing motion distribution and body behavior. Our architecture extracts meaningful information from pose sequences, aggregates displacements and accelerations into the input model, and finally predicts the output displacements. Extensive experiments on Human 3.6M, AMASS, 3DPW, and ExPI datasets demonstrate that CIST-GCN outperforms previous methods in human motion prediction and robustness. Since the idea of enhancing interpretability for motion prediction has its merits, we showcase experiments towards it and provide preliminary evaluations of such insights here. available code: https://github.com/QualityMinds/cistgcn</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

While large strides have been made towards developing dynamic SLAM approaches that estimate the robot pose accurately, a lesser emphasis has been put on the construction of dense spatio-temporal representations of the robot environment. A detailed understanding of the scene and its evolution through time is crucial for long-term robot autonomy and essential to tasks that require long-term reasoning, such as operating effectively in environments shared with humans and other agents and thus are subject to short and long-term dynamics. To address this challenge, this work defines the Spatio-temporal Metric-semantic SLAM (SMS) problem, and presents a framework to factorize and solve it efficiently. We show that the proposed factorization suggests a natural organization of a spatio-temporal perception system, where a fast process tracks short-term dynamics in an active temporal window, while a slower process reasons over long-term changes in the environment using a factor graph formulation. We provide an efficient implementation of the proposed spatio-temporal perception approach, that we call Khronos, and show that it unifies exiting interpretations of short-term and long-term dynamics and is able to construct a dense spatio-temporal map in real-time. We provide simulated and real results, showing that the spatio-temporal maps built by Khronos are an accurate reflection of a 3D scene over time and that Khronos outperforms baselines across multiple metrics. We further validate our approach on two heterogeneous robots in challenging, large-scale real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code to be released at: https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Khronos</p></details> |

Glaucoma forecast is a good solution to early screening and intervention of potential patients, which is helpful to prevent further deterioration of the disease. It leverages a series of historical fundus images of an eye and forecasts the likelihood of glaucoma occurrence in the future. However, the irregular sampling nature and the imbalanced class distribution are two challenges in the development of disease forecasting approaches. To this end, we introduce the Multi-scale Spatio-temporal Transformer Network (MST-former) based on the transformer architecture tailored for sequential image inputs, which can effectively learn representative semantic information from sequential images on both temporal and spatial dimensions. Specifically, we employ a multi-scale structure to extract features at various resolutions, which can largely exploit rich spatial information encoded in each image. Besides, we design a time distance matrix to scale time attention in a non-linear manner, which could effectively deal with the irregularly sampled data. Furthermore, we introduce a temperature-controlled Balanced Softmax Cross-entropy loss to address the class imbalance issue. Extensive experiments on the Sequential fundus Images for Glaucoma Forecast (SIGF) dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MST-former method, achieving an AUC of 98.6% for glaucoma forecasting. Besides, our method shows excellent generalization capability on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) MRI dataset, with an accuracy of 90.3% for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease prediction, outperforming the compared method by a large margin.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

Indeed, different correlations and influences arise in a dynamic traffic network, making modeling a complicated task. Existing literature has proposed many different methods to capture traffic networks' complex underlying spatial-temporal relations. However, given the heterogeneity of traffic data, consistently capturing both spatial and temporal dependencies presents a significant challenge. Also, as more and more sophisticated methods are being proposed, models are increasingly becoming memory-heavy and, thus, unsuitable for low-powered devices. To this end, we propose Spatio-Temporal Lightweight Graph GRU, namely STLGRU, a novel traffic forecasting model for predicting traffic flow accurately. Specifically, our proposed STLGRU can effectively capture dynamic local and global spatial-temporal relations of traffic networks using memory-augmented attention and gating mechanisms in a continuously synchronized manner. Moreover, instead of employing separate temporal and spatial components, we show that our memory module and gated unit can successfully learn the spatial-temporal dependencies with reduced memory usage and fewer parameters. Extensive experimental results on three real-world public traffic datasets demonstrate that our method can not only achieve state-of-the-art performance but also exhibit competitive computational efficiency.

However, the majority of current methods rely on static data, neglecting the dynamic nature and the hidden spatio-temporal attributes of real-world scenarios. This often results in suboptimal predictions and recommendations. Although there are effective spatio-temporal inference methods, they face challenges such as scalability with large datasets and inadequate semantic understanding, which impede their performance. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel framework - Simple Spatio-Temporal Knowledge Graph (SSTKG), for constructing and exploring spatio-temporal KGs. To integrate spatial and temporal data into KGs, our framework exploited through a new 3-step embedding method.

Although pretrained foundation models for natural languages have experienced remarkable breakthroughs, wherein one general-purpose model can tackle multiple tasks across various domains, urban spatio-temporal modeling lags behind. Existing approaches for urban prediction are usually tailored for specific spatio-temporal scenarios, requiring task-specific model designs and extensive in-domain training data. In this work, we propose a universal model, UniST, for urban spatio-temporal prediction. Drawing inspiration from large language models, UniST achieves success through: (i) flexibility towards diverse spatio-temporal data characteristics, (ii) effective generative pre-training with elaborated masking strategies to capture complex spatio-temporal relationships, (iii) spatio-temporal knowledge-guided prompts that align and leverage intrinsic and shared knowledge across scenarios. These designs together unlock the potential of a one-for-all model for spatio-temporal prediction with powerful generalization capability. Extensive experiments on 15 cities and 6 domains demonstrate the universality of UniST in advancing state-of-the-art prediction performance, especially in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |

While the research community's focus on Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA), the field of answering questions incorporating both spatio-temporal information based on STKGs remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, a lack of comprehensive datasets also has hindered progress in this area. To address this issue, we present STQAD, a dataset comprising 10,000 natural language questions for spatio-temporal knowledge graph question answering (STKGQA). Unfortunately, various state-of-the-art KGQA approaches fall far short of achieving satisfactory performance on our dataset. In response, we propose STCQA, a new spatio-temporal KGQA approach that utilizes a novel STKG embedding method named STComplEx. By extracting temporal and spatial information from a question, our QA model can better comprehend the question and retrieve accurate answers from the STKG. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the quality of our dataset and the effectiveness of our STKGQA method.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

However, these statistics are often based on sensitive location data of people, and hence privacy has to be preserved while releasing them. The standard way to do this is via differential privacy, which guarantees a form of rigorous, worst-case, person-level privacy. In this work, motivated by several counter-intuitive features of differential privacy in distributed location applications, we propose an alternative privacy loss against location reconstruction attacks by an informed adversary. Our experiments on real and synthetic data demonstrate that our privacy loss better reflects our intuitions on individual privacy violation in the distributed spatio-temporal setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Chrom...</summary><p>Chrome PDF viewer might not display Figures 3 and 4 properly</p></details> |

Most recent works try to model the user preference by treating the sessions as between-item transition graphs and utilize various graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode the representations of pair-wise relations among items and their neighbors. Some of the existing GNN-based models mainly focus on aggregating information from the view of spatial graph structure, which ignores the temporal relations within neighbors of an item during message passing and the information loss results in a sub-optimal problem. Other works embrace this challenge by incorporating additional temporal information but lack sufficient interaction between the spatial and temporal patterns. To address this issue, inspired by the uniformity and alignment properties of contrastive learning techniques, we propose a novel framework called Session-based Recommendation with Spatio-Temporal Contrastive Learning Enhanced GNNs (RESTC). The idea is to supplement the GNN-based main supervised recommendation task with the temporal representation via an auxiliary cross-view contrastive learning mechanism. Furthermore, a novel global collaborative filtering graph (CFG) embedding is leveraged to enhance the spatial view in the main task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant performance of RESTC compared with the state-of-the-art baselines e.g., with an improvement as much as 27.08% gain on HR@20 and 20.10% gain on MRR@20.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transaction on Information Systems (ACM TOIS)</p></details> |

Our study addresses this concern through point process theory. Each wildfire is treated as a unique point in both space and time, allowing us to assess the influence of environmental and anthropogenic factors by fitting a spatio-temporal separable Poisson point process model, with a particular focus on the role of land usage. First, a spatial log-linear Poisson model is applied to investigate the influence of land use types on wildfire distribution, controlling for other environmental covariates. The results highlight the significant effect of human activities, altitude, and slope on spatial fire occurrence. Then, a Generalized Additive Model with Poisson-distributed response further explores the temporal dynamics of wildfire occurrences, confirming their dependence on various environmental variables, including the maximum daily temperature, wind speed, surface pressure, and total precipitation.</p></details> |  |

The objective of our work is to leverage this complementary information to improve detection. Therefore, we propose a spatio-temporal fusion framework (STF). We first introduce multi-frame and single-frame attention modules that allow a neural network to share feature maps between nearby frames to obtain more robust object representations. Second, we introduce a dual-frame fusion module that merges feature maps in a learnable manner to improve them. Our evaluation is conducted on three different benchmarks including video sequences of moving road users. The performed experiments demonstrate that the proposed spatio-temporal fusion module leads to improved detection performance compared to baseline object detectors.

| **[IR-STP: Enhancing Autonomous Driving with Interaction Reasoning in Spatio-Temporal Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02850v3)** | 2024-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Considerable research efforts have been devoted to the development of motion planning algorithms, which form a cornerstone of the autonomous driving system (ADS). Nonetheless, acquiring an interactive and secure trajectory for the ADS remains challenging due to the complex nature of interaction modeling in planning. Modern planning methods still employ a uniform treatment of prediction outcomes and solely rely on collision-avoidance strategies, leading to suboptimal planning performance. To address this limitation, this paper presents a novel prediction-based interactive planning framework for autonomous driving. Our method incorporates interaction reasoning into spatio-temporal (s-t) planning by defining interaction conditions and constraints. Specifically, it records and continually updates interaction relations for each planned state throughout the forward search. We assess the performance of our approach alongside state-of-the-art methods in the CommonRoad environment. Our experiments include a total of 232 scenarios, with variations in the accuracy of prediction outcomes, modality, and degrees of planner aggressiveness. The experimental findings demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method. It leads to a reduction of collision times by approximately 17.6% in 3-modal scenarios, along with improvements of nearly 7.6% in distance completeness and 31.7% in the fail rate in single-modal scenarios. For the community's reference, our code is accessible at https://github.com/ChenYingbing/IR-STP-Planner.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, accepted by IEEE-TITS at this January</p></details> |
| **[Large-scale unsupervised spatio-temporal semantic analysis of vast regions from satellite images sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13504v3)** | 2024-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal sequences of satellite images constitute a highly valuable and abundant resource for analyzing regions of interest. However, the automatic acquisition of knowledge on a large scale is a challenging task due to different factors such as the lack of precise labeled data, the definition and variability of the terrain entities, or the inherent complexity of the images and their fusion. In this context, we present a fully unsupervised and general methodology to conduct spatio-temporal taxonomies of large regions from sequences of satellite images. Our approach relies on a combination of deep embeddings and time series clustering to capture the semantic properties of the ground and its evolution over time, providing a comprehensive understanding of the region of interest. The proposed method is enhanced by a novel procedure specifically devised to refine the embedding and exploit the underlying spatio-temporal patterns. We use this methodology to conduct an in-depth analysis of a 220 km$^2$ region in northern Spain in different settings. The results provide a broad and intuitive perspective of the land where large areas are connected in a compact and well-structured manner, mainly based on climatic, phytological, and hydrological factors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parallel-friendly Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning for Photovoltaic Degradation Analysis at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08470v1)** | 2024-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network empowered trend analysis approach (ST-GTrend) to perform fleet-level performance degradation analysis for Photovoltaic (PV) power networks. PV power stations have become an integral component to the global sustainable energy production landscape. Accurately estimating the performance of PV systems is critical to their feasibility as a power generation technology and as a financial asset. One of the most challenging problems in assessing the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) of a PV system is to understand and estimate the long-term Performance Loss Rate (PLR) for large fleets of PV inverters. ST-GTrend integrates spatio-temporal coherence and graph attention to separate PLR as a long-term "aging" trend from multiple fluctuation terms in the PV input data. To cope with diverse degradation patterns in timeseries, ST-GTrend adopts a paralleled graph autoencoder array to extract aging and fluctuation terms simultaneously. ST-GTrend imposes flatness and smoothness regularization to ensure the disentanglement between aging and fluctuation. To scale the analysis to large PV systems, we also introduce Para-GTrend, a parallel algorithm to accelerate the training and inference of ST-GTrend. We have evaluated ST-GTrend on three large-scale PV datasets, spanning a time period of 10 years. Our results show that ST-GTrend reduces Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) and Euclidean Distances by 34.74% and 33.66% compared to the SOTA methods. Our results demonstrate that Para-GTrend can speed up ST-GTrend by up to 7.92 times. We further verify the generality and effectiveness of ST-GTrend for trend analysis using financial and economic datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Matrix Autoregressive Model with Vector Time Series Covariates for Spatio-Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15671v2)** | 2024-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a new methodology for forecasting matrix-valued time series with historical matrix data and auxiliary vector time series data. We focus on time series of matrices with observations distributed on a fixed 2-D spatial grid, i.e., the spatio-temporal data, and an auxiliary time series of non-spatial vectors. The proposed model, Matrix AutoRegression with Auxiliary Covariates (MARAC), contains an autoregressive component for the historical matrix predictors and an additive component that maps the auxiliary vector predictors to a matrix response via tensor-vector product. The autoregressive component adopts a bi-linear transformation framework following Chen et al. (2021), significantly reducing the number of parameters. The auxiliary component posits that the tensor coefficient, which maps non-spatial predictors to a spatial response, contains slices of spatially-smooth matrix coefficients that are discrete evaluations of smooth functions from a Reproducible Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We propose to estimate the model parameters under a penalized maximum likelihood estimation framework coupled with an alternating minimization algorithm. We establish the joint asymptotics of the autoregressive and tensor parameters under fixed and high-dimensional regimes. Extensive simulations and a geophysical application for forecasting the global Total Electron Content (TEC) are conducted to validate the performance of MARAC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Digital Twin Mobility Profiling: A Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03750v1)** | 2024-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the arrival of the big data era, mobility profiling has become a viable method of utilizing enormous amounts of mobility data to create an intelligent transportation system. Mobility profiling can extract potential patterns in urban traffic from mobility data and is critical for a variety of traffic-related applications. However, due to the high level of complexity and the huge amount of data, mobility profiling faces huge challenges. Digital Twin (DT) technology paves the way for cost-effective and performance-optimised management by digitally creating a virtual representation of the network to simulate its behaviour. In order to capture the complex spatio-temporal features in traffic scenario, we construct alignment diagrams to assist in completing the spatio-temporal correlation representation and design dilated alignment convolution network (DACN) to learn the fine-grained correlations, i.e., spatio-temporal interactions. We propose a digital twin mobility profiling (DTMP) framework to learn node profiles on a mobility network DT model. Extensive experiments have been conducted upon three real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DTMP.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Modeling Spatio-temporal Dynamical Systems with Neural Discrete Learning and Levels-of-Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05970v1)** | 2024-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we address the issue of modeling and estimating changes in the state of the spatio-temporal dynamical systems based on a sequence of observations like video frames. Traditional numerical simulation systems depend largely on the initial settings and correctness of the constructed partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite recent efforts yielding significant success in discovering data-driven PDEs with neural networks, the limitations posed by singular scenarios and the absence of local insights prevent them from performing effectively in a broader real-world context. To this end, this paper propose the universal expert module -- that is, optical flow estimation component, to capture the evolution laws of general physical processes in a data-driven fashion. To enhance local insight, we painstakingly design a finer-grained physical pipeline, since local characteristics may be influenced by various internal contextual information, which may contradict the macroscopic properties of the whole system. Further, we harness currently popular neural discrete learning to unveil the underlying important features in its latent space, this process better injects interpretability, which can help us obtain a powerful prior over these discrete random variables. We conduct extensive experiments and ablations to demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves large performance margins, compared with the existing SOTA baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Adversarial Networks for Spatio-Spectral Compression of Hyperspectral Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08514v2)** | 2024-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of deep learning-based models for the compression of hyperspectral images (HSIs) has recently attracted great attention in remote sensing due to the sharp growing of hyperspectral data archives. Most of the existing models achieve either spectral or spatial compression, and do not jointly consider the spatio-spectral redundancies present in HSIs. To address this problem, in this paper we focus our attention on the High Fidelity Compression (HiFiC) model (which is proven to be highly effective for spatial compression problems) and adapt it to perform spatio-spectral compression of HSIs. In detail, we introduce two new models: i) HiFiC using Squeeze and Excitation (SE) blocks (denoted as HiFiC$_{SE}$); and ii) HiFiC with 3D convolutions (denoted as HiFiC$_{3D}$) in the framework of compression of HSIs. We analyze the effectiveness of HiFiC$_{SE}$ and HiFiC$_{3D}$ in compressing the spatio-spectral redundancies with channel attention and inter-dependency analysis. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed models in performing spatio-spectral compression, while reconstructing images at reduced bitrates with higher reconstruction quality. The code of the proposed models is publicly available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/HSI-SSC .</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal Prompting Network for Robust Video Feature Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02574v1)** | 2024-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Frame quality deterioration is one of the main challenges in the field of video understanding. To compensate for the information loss caused by deteriorated frames, recent approaches exploit transformer-based integration modules to obtain spatio-temporal information. However, these integration modules are heavy and complex. Furthermore, each integration module is specifically tailored for its target task, making it difficult to generalise to multiple tasks. In this paper, we present a neat and unified framework, called Spatio-Temporal Prompting Network (STPN). It can efficiently extract robust and accurate video features by dynamically adjusting the input features in the backbone network. Specifically, STPN predicts several video prompts containing spatio-temporal information of neighbour frames. Then, these video prompts are prepended to the patch embeddings of the current frame as the updated input for video feature extraction. Moreover, STPN is easy to generalise to various video tasks because it does not contain task-specific modules. Without bells and whistles, STPN achieves state-of-the-art performance on three widely-used datasets for different video understanding tasks, i.e., ImageNetVID for video object detection, YouTubeVIS for video instance segmentation, and GOT-10k for visual object tracking. Code is available at https://github.com/guanxiongsun/vfe.pytorch.</p></details> |  |

However, the utilization of 2D LiDAR in Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) frequently encounters challenges related to motion degeneracy, particularly in geometrically similar environments. To address this problem, this paper proposes a robust, accurate, and multi-sensor-fused 2D LiDAR SLAM system specifically designed for indoor mobile robots. To commence, the original LiDAR data undergoes meticulous processing through point and line extraction. Leveraging the distinctive characteristics of indoor environments, line-line constraints are established to complement other sensor data effectively, thereby augmenting the overall robustness and precision of the system. Concurrently, a tightly-coupled front-end is created, integrating data from the 2D LiDAR, IMU, and wheel odometry, thus enabling real-time state estimation. Building upon this solid foundation, a novel global feature point matching-based loop closure detection algorithm is proposed. This algorithm proves highly effective in mitigating front-end accumulated errors and ultimately constructs a globally consistent map. The experimental results indicate that our system fully meets real-time requirements. When compared to Cartographer, our system not only exhibits lower trajectory errors but also demonstrates stronger robustness, particularly in degeneracy problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ne...</summary><p>We need a major revision before more readers see it.

In this paper, a method is presented that makes it possible to predict the properties of fresh concrete during the mixing process based on stereoscopic image sequences of the concretes flow behaviour. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used for the prediction, which receives the images supported by information on the mix design as input. In addition, the network receives temporal information in the form of the time difference between the time at which the images are taken and the time at which the reference values of the concretes are carried out. With this temporal information, the network implicitly learns the time-dependent behaviour of the concretes properties. The network predicts the slump flow diameter, the yield stress and the plastic viscosity. The time-dependent prediction potentially opens up the pathway to determine the temporal development of the fresh concrete properties already during mixing. This provides a huge advantage for the concrete industry. As a result, countermeasures can be taken in a timely manner. It is shown that an approach based on depth and optical flow images, supported by information of the mix design, achieves the best results.</p></details> |  |

Exact solutions to this problem are based on error-correcting coding techniques and suffer from a large decoding time. Existing probabilistic solutions based on Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables (IBLTs) are time-efficient but offer insufficient success guarantees for many applications. Here we propose a tunable trade-off between the two approaches combining the efficiency of IBLTs with exponentially decreasing failure probability. The proof relies on a refined analysis of IBLTs proposed in (Baek Tejs Houen et al. SOSA 2023) which has an independent interest. We also propose a modification of our algorithm that enables telling apart the elements of each set in the symmetric difference.</p></details> | 19 pages |

The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Large Language Models in Issuing Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions: Fostering Physical Activity in a Prospective Cardiac Rehabilitation Setting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08658v2)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigated the viability of using Large Language Models (LLMs) for triggering and personalizing content for Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) in digital health. JITAIs are being explored as a key mechanism for sustainable behavior change, adapting interventions to an individual's current context and needs. However, traditional rule-based and machine learning models for JITAI implementation face scalability and flexibility limitations, such as lack of personalization, difficulty in managing multi-parametric systems, and issues with data sparsity. To investigate JITAI implementation via LLMs, we tested the contemporary overall performance-leading model 'GPT-4' with examples grounded in the use case of fostering heart-healthy physical activity in outpatient cardiac rehabilitation. Three personas and five sets of context information per persona were used as a basis of triggering and personalizing JITAIs. Subsequently, we generated a total of 450 proposed JITAI decisions and message content, divided equally into JITAIs generated by 10 iterations with GPT-4, a baseline provided by 10 laypersons (LayPs), and a gold standard set by 10 healthcare professionals (HCPs). Ratings from 27 LayPs and 11 HCPs indicated that JITAIs generated by GPT-4 were superior to those by HCPs and LayPs over all assessed scales: i.e., appropriateness, engagement, effectiveness, and professionality. This study indicates that LLMs have significant potential for implementing JITAIs as a building block of personalized or "precision" health, offering scalability, effective personalization based on opportunistically sampled information, and good acceptability.</p></details> |  |

We consider the case where observability of the parameters depends on the excitation of the system and may be absent during operation, with the parameter dynamics fulfilling a weak incremental bounded-energy bounded-state property to ensure boundedness of the estimation error (with respect to the disturbance energy). The proposed estimation scheme involves a standard quadratic cost function with an adaptive regularization term depending on the current parameter observability. We develop robustness guarantees for the overall estimation error that are valid for all times, and that improve the more often the parameters are detected to be observable during operation.

We first establish semi-discrete scheme of time-space fractional diffusion equation, which uses linear finite element or fourth-order compact difference method combining with matrix transfer technique to approximate spectral fractional Laplacian. Then we introduce a fast time-stepping L1 scheme for time discretization. The proposed scheme can exactly evaluate fractional power of matrix and perform matrix-vector multiplication at per time level by using discrete sine transform, which doesn't need to resort to any iteration method and can significantly reduce computation cost and memory requirement. Further, we address stability and convergence analyses of full discrete scheme based on fast time-stepping L1 scheme on graded time mesh. Our analysis shows that the choice of graded mesh factor $\omega=(2-\alpha)/\alpha$ shall give an optimal temporal convergence $\mathcal{O}(N^{-(2-\alpha)})$ with $N$ denoting the number of time mesh. Finally, ample numerical examples are delivered to illustrate our theoretical analysis and the efficiency of the suggested scheme.</p></details> |  |

To capture quantum polynomial-time computability, a new recursion-theoretic approach was taken lately by Yamakami [J. Symb. Logic 80, pp. 1546--1587, 2020] by way of recursion schematic definitions, which constitute six initial quantum functions and three construction schemes of composition, branching, and multi-qubit quantum recursion. By taking a similar approach, we look into quantum polylogarithmic-time computability and further explore the expressing power of elementary schemes designed for such quantum computation. In particular, we introduce an elementary form of the quantum recursion, called the fast quantum recursion and formulate EQS (elementary quantum schemes) of "elementary" quantum functions. This class EQS captures exactly quantum polylogarithmic-time computability, represented by BQPOLYLOGTIME. We also demonstrate the separation of BQPOLYLOGTIME from NLOGTIME and PPOLYLOGTIME. As a natural extension of EQS, we further consider an algorithmic procedural scheme that implements the well-known divide-and-conquer strategy. This divide-and-conquer scheme helps compute the parity function but the scheme cannot be realized within our system EQS.</p></details> | <details><summary>(A4, ...</summary><p>(A4, 10pt, 29 pages) This is a corrected and expanded version of the preliminary report that has appeared, under a different title, in the Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Logic, Language, Information, and Computation (WoLLIC 2022), Ia\c{s}i, Romania, September 20--23, 2022, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 13468, pp. 88-104, Springer, 2022</p></details> |

An ensemble POD-GP methodology (EnPOD-GP) is introduced to significantly improve the training effectiveness and prediction accuracy by dividing a large number of heat sources into heat source blocks (HSBs) each of which may contains one or a very small number of heat sources. Although very accurate, efficient and robust to any power map, EnPOD-GP suffers from intensive training for microprocessors with an enormous number of cores. A local-domain EnPOD-GP model (LEnPOD-GP) is thus proposed to further minimize the training burden. LEnPOD-GP utilizes the concepts of local domain truncation and generic building blocks to reduce the massive training data. LEnPOD-GP has been demonstrated on thermal simulation of NVIDIA Tesla Volta GV100, a GPU with more than 13,000 cores including FP32, FP64, INT32, and Tensor Cores. Due to the domain truncation for LEnPOD-GP, the least square error (LSE) is degraded but is still as small as 1.6% over the entire space and below 1.4% in the device layer when using 4 modes per HSB. When only the maximum temperature of the entire GPU is of interest, LEnPOD-GP offers a computing speed 1.1 million times faster than the FEM with a maximum error near 1.2 degrees over the entire simulation time.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |

Unlike previous methods that can only control the pelvis trajectory, OmniControl can incorporate flexible spatial control signals over different joints at different times with only one model. Specifically, we propose analytic spatial guidance that ensures the generated motion can tightly conform to the input control signals. At the same time, realism guidance is introduced to refine all the joints to generate more coherent motion. Both the spatial and realism guidance are essential and they are highly complementary for balancing control accuracy and motion realism. By combining them, OmniControl generates motions that are realistic, coherent, and consistent with the spatial constraints. Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets show that OmniControl not only achieves significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods on pelvis control but also shows promising results when incorporating the constraints over other joints.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2024.

In many applications, the data grows dynamically, requiring their filters to expand along with the data that they represent. However, existing methods for expanding filters cannot maintain stable performance, memory footprint, and false positive rate at the same time. We address this problem with Aleph Filter, which makes the following contributions. (1) It supports all operations (insertions, queries, deletes, etc.) in constant time, no matter how much the data grows. (2) Given any rough estimate of how much the data will ultimately grow, Aleph Filter provides far superior memory vs. false positive rate trade-offs, even if the estimate is off by orders of magnitude.</p></details> |  |

| **[Evaluating Large Language Models as Virtual Annotators for Time-series Physical Sensing Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01133v2)** | 2024-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional human-in-the-loop-based annotation for time-series data like inertial data often requires access to alternate modalities like video or audio from the environment. These alternate sources provide the necessary information to the human annotator, as the raw numeric data is often too obfuscated even for an expert. However, this traditional approach has many concerns surrounding overall cost, efficiency, storage of additional modalities, time, scalability, and privacy. Interestingly, recent large language models (LLMs) are also trained with vast amounts of publicly available alphanumeric data, which allows them to comprehend and perform well on tasks beyond natural language processing. Naturally, this opens up a potential avenue to explore LLMs as virtual annotators where the LLMs will be directly provided the raw sensor data for annotation instead of relying on any alternate modality. Naturally, this could mitigate the problems of the traditional human-in-the-loop approach. Motivated by this observation, we perform a detailed study in this paper to assess whether the state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs can be used as virtual annotators for labeling time-series physical sensing data. To perform this in a principled manner, we segregate the study into two major phases. In the first phase, we investigate the challenges an LLM like GPT-4 faces in comprehending raw sensor data. Considering the observations from phase 1, in the next phase, we investigate the possibility of encoding the raw sensor data using SOTA SSL approaches and utilizing the projected time-series data to get annotations from the LLM. Detailed evaluation with four benchmark HAR datasets shows that SSL-based encoding and metric-based guidance allow the LLM to make more reasonable decisions and provide accurate annotations without requiring computationally expensive fine-tuning or sophisticated prompt engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finite-Time Analysis of On-Policy Heterogeneous Federated Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15273v2)** | 2024-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated reinforcement learning (FRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for reducing the sample complexity of reinforcement learning tasks by exploiting information from different agents. However, when each agent interacts with a potentially different environment, little to nothing is known theoretically about the non-asymptotic performance of FRL algorithms. The lack of such results can be attributed to various technical challenges and their intricate interplay: Markovian sampling, linear function approximation, multiple local updates to save communication, heterogeneity in the reward functions and transition kernels of the agents' MDPs, and continuous state-action spaces. Moreover, in the on-policy setting, the behavior policies vary with time, further complicating the analysis. In response, we introduce FedSARSA, a novel federated on-policy reinforcement learning scheme, equipped with linear function approximation, to address these challenges and provide a comprehensive finite-time error analysis. Notably, we establish that FedSARSA converges to a policy that is near-optimal for all agents, with the extent of near-optimality proportional to the level of heterogeneity. Furthermore, we prove that FedSARSA leverages agent collaboration to enable linear speedups as the number of agents increases, which holds for both fixed and adaptive step-size configurations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024</p></details> |

Yet, existing RF-oriented generative solutions are ill-suited for generating high-quality, time-series RF data due to limited representation capabilities. In this work, inspired by the stellar achievements of the diffusion model in CV and NLP, we adapt it to the RF domain and propose RF-Diffusion. To accommodate the unique characteristics of RF signals, we first introduce a novel Time-Frequency Diffusion theory to enhance the original diffusion model, enabling it to tap into the information within the time, frequency, and complex-valued domains of RF signals. On this basis, we propose a Hierarchical Diffusion Transformer to translate the theory into a practical generative DNN through elaborated design spanning network architecture, functional block, and complex-valued operator, making RF-Diffusion a versatile solution to generate diverse, high-quality, and time-series RF data. Performance comparison with three prevalent generative models demonstrates the RF-Diffusion's superior performance in synthesizing Wi-Fi and FMCW signals. We also showcase the versatility of RF-Diffusion in boosting Wi-Fi sensing systems and performing channel estimation in 5G networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MobiCom 2024</p></details> |

One of the most popular methods assumes that the temporal distribution shift occurs uniformly to disentangle the stationary and nonstationary dependencies. But this assumption is difficult to meet, as we do not know when the distribution shifts occur. To solve this problem, we propose to learn IDentifiable latEnt stAtes (IDEA) to detect when the distribution shifts occur. Beyond that, we further disentangle the stationary and nonstationary latent states via sufficient observation assumption to learn how the latent states change. Specifically, we formalize the causal process with environment-irrelated stationary and environment-related nonstationary variables. Under mild conditions, we show that latent environments and stationary/nonstationary variables are identifiable. Based on these theories, we devise the IDEA model, which incorporates an autoregressive hidden Markov model to estimate latent environments and modular prior networks to identify latent states. The IDEA model outperforms several latest nonstationary forecasting methods on various benchmark datasets, highlighting its advantages in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Despite its widespread use in various optimization contexts, the statistical properties of block coordinate descent in continuous-time system identification have not been covered in the literature. The aim of this paper is to formally analyze the bias properties of the block coordinate descent approach for the identification of MISO and additive SISO systems. We characterize the asymptotic bias at each iteration, and provide sufficient conditions for the consistency of the estimator for each identification setting. The theoretical results are supported by simulation examples.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |

These responses and event prevalences combine non-trivially to govern antibody levels sampled from a population. Time-dependence and disease prevalence pose considerable modeling challenges that need to be addressed to provide a rigorous mathematical underpinning of the underlying biology. We propose a time-inhomogeneous Markov chain model for event-to-event transitions coupled with a probabilistic framework for anti-body kinetics and demonstrate its use in a setting in which individuals can be infected or vaccinated but not both. We prove the equivalency of this approach to the framework developed in our previous work. Synthetic data are used to demonstrate the modeling process and conduct prevalence estimation via transition probability matrices. This approach is ideal to model sequences of infections and vaccinations, or personal trajectories in a population, making it an important first step towards a mathematical characterization of reinfection, vaccination boosting, and cross-events of infection after vaccination or vice versa.</p></details> | 27 pages, 7 figures |
| **[A Fair and Memory/Time-efficient Hashmap](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11355v2)** | 2024-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hashmap is a fundamental data structure in computer science. There has been extensive research on constructing hashmaps that minimize the number of collisions leading to efficient lookup query time. Recently, the data-dependant approaches, construct hashmaps tailored for a target data distribution that guarantee to uniformly distribute data across different buckets and hence minimize the collisions. Still, to the best of our knowledge, none of the existing technique guarantees group fairness among different groups of items stored in the hashmap. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce FairHash, a data-dependant hashmap that guarantees uniform distribution at the group-level across hash buckets, and hence, satisfies the statistical parity notion of group fairness. We formally define, three notions of fairness and, unlike existing work, FairHash satisfies all three of them simultaneously. We propose three families of algorithms to design fair hashmaps, suitable for different settings. Our ranking-based algorithms reduce the unfairness of data-dependant hashmaps without any memory-overhead. The cut-based algorithms guarantee zero-unfairness in all cases, irrespective of how the data is distributed, but those introduce an extra memory-overhead. Last but not least, the discrepancy-based algorithms enable trading off between various fairness notions. In addition to the theoretical analysis, we perform extensive experiments to evaluate the efficiency and efficacy of our algorithms on real datasets. Our results verify the superiority of FairHash compared to the other baselines on fairness at almost no performance cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Timing Advance Estimation in Low Earth Orbit Satellite Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08960v1)** | 2024-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication based on 3GPP standard is seen as a promising solution to rolling out communication services in areas without terrestrial base stations. However, due to the fast movement of satellites and large beam footprint size, the existing 5G timing advance (TA) estimation mechanism cannot be directly applied when global navigation satellite system is unavailable. In this article, an enhanced TA estimation approach is proposed for LEO satellite communication networks. Specifically, a user-side time-frequency pre-compensation method is introduced at first, which leverages frequency offset measurement on synchronization signal blocks broadcasted by satellites in initial cell search phase. For the random access phase, the upper bound of inter-preamble interference incurred by partial-period cross-correlation operations is derived for a preamble format advised by 3GPP, and it is shown that the interference level is closely related to the square of the number of such operations. Inspired by this result, a cyclic prefix free preamble format is further designed, which features extended guard time, differential power allocation and flexible preamble structure. Numerical results show that our proposal can reduce the missed detection rate of preamble within a beam. Particularly, the missed detection rates of preamble under 32, 48, and 64 users are lower than 1% when SNR = -6 dB, which is a significant improvement compared to baselines. In addition, our proposal can limit the TA estimation error of the detected users to the time length of 25 time-domain sampling points when the subcarrier spacing is 30 kHz and operation frequency is 27 GHz.</p></details> | 17 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Beam Management in Low Earth Orbit Satellite Networks with Random Traffic Arrival and Time-varying Topology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08959v1)** | 2024-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication networks have been considered as promising solutions to providing high data rate and seamless coverage, where satellite beam management plays a key role. However, due to the limitation of beam resource, dynamic network topology, beam spectrum reuse, time-varying traffic arrival and service continuity requirement, it is challenging to effectively allocate time-frequency resource of satellite beams to multiple cells. In this paper, aiming at reducing time-averaged beam revisit time and mitigate inter-satellite handover, a beam management problem is formulated for dynamic LEO satellite communication networks, under inter-cell interference and network stability constraints. Particularly, inter-cell interference constraints are further simplified into off-axis angle based constraints, which provide tractable rules for spectrum sharing between two beam cells. To deal with the long-term performance optimization, the primal problem is transformed into a series of single epoch problems by adopting Lyapunov optimization framework. Since the transformed problem is NP-hard, it is further divided into three subproblems, including serving beam allocation, beam service time allocation and serving satellite allocation. With the help of conflict graphs built with off-axis angle based constraints, serving beam allocation and beam service time allocation algorithms are developed to reduce beam revisit time and cell packet queue length. Then, we further develop a satellite-cell service relationship optimization algorithm to better adapt to dynamic network topology. Compared with baselines, numerical results show that our proposal can reduce average beam revisit time by 20.8% and keep strong network stability with similar inter-satellite handover frequency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Consistency analysis of refined instrumental variable methods for continuous-time system identification in closed-loop](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08955v1)** | 2024-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Refined instrumental variable methods have been broadly used for identification of continuous-time systems in both open and closed-loop settings. However, the theoretical properties of these methods are still yet to be fully understood when operating in closed-loop. In this paper, we address the consistency of the simplified refined instrumental variable method for continuous-time systems (SRIVC) and its closed-loop variant CLSRIVC when they are applied on data that is generated from a feedback loop. In particular, we consider feedback loops consisting of continuous-time controllers, as well as the discrete-time control case. This paper proves that the SRIVC and CLSRIVC estimators are not generically consistent when there is a continuous-time controller in the loop, and that generic consistency can be achieved when the controller is implemented in discrete-time. Numerical simulations are presented to support the theoretical results.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |
| **[A Novel State-Centric Necessary Condition for Time-Optimal Control of Controllable Linear Systems Based on Augmented Switching Laws](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08943v1)** | 2024-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing necessary conditions for optimal control based on adjoining methods require both state information and costate information, yet the lack of costates for a given feasible trajectory in practice impedes the determination of optimality. This paper establishes a novel theoretical framework for time-optimal control of controllable linear systems, proposing the augmented switching law that represents the input control and the feasibility in a compact form. Given a feasible trajectory, the disturbed trajectory under the constraints of augmented switching law is guaranteed to be feasible, resulting in a novel state-centric necessary condition without dependence on costate information. A first order necessary condition is proposed that the Jacobian matrix of the augmented switching law is not full row rank, which also results in an approach to optimizing a given feasible trajectory further. The proposed necessary condition is applied to the chain-of-integrators systems with full box constraints, contributing to some conclusions challenging to reason by traditional costate-based necessary conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unraveling Batch Normalization for Realistic Test-Time Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09486v3)** | 2024-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent test-time adaptations exhibit efficacy by adjusting batch normalization to narrow domain disparities, their effectiveness diminishes with realistic mini-batches due to inaccurate target estimation. As previous attempts merely introduce source statistics to mitigate this issue, the fundamental problem of inaccurate target estimation still persists, leaving the intrinsic test-time domain shifts unresolved. This paper delves into the problem of mini-batch degradation. By unraveling batch normalization, we discover that the inexact target statistics largely stem from the substantially reduced class diversity in batch. Drawing upon this insight, we introduce a straightforward tool, Test-time Exponential Moving Average (TEMA), to bridge the class diversity gap between training and testing batches. Importantly, our TEMA adaptively extends the scope of typical methods beyond the current batch to incorporate a diverse set of class information, which in turn boosts an accurate target estimation. Built upon this foundation, we further design a novel layer-wise rectification strategy to consistently promote test-time performance. Our proposed method enjoys a unique advantage as it requires neither training nor tuning parameters, offering a truly hassle-free solution. It significantly enhances model robustness against shifted domains and maintains resilience in diverse real-world scenarios with various batch sizes, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several major benchmarks.

| **[Rethinking Channel Dependence for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting: Learning from Leading Indicators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17548v5)** | 2024-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, channel-independent methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Despite reducing overfitting risks, these methods miss potential opportunities in utilizing channel dependence for accurate predictions. We argue that there exist locally stationary lead-lag relationships between variates, i.e., some lagged variates may follow the leading indicators within a short time period. Exploiting such channel dependence is beneficial since leading indicators offer advance information that can be used to reduce the forecasting difficulty of the lagged variates. In this paper, we propose a new method named LIFT that first efficiently estimates leading indicators and their leading steps at each time step and then judiciously allows the lagged variates to utilize the advance information from leading indicators. LIFT plays as a plugin that can be seamlessly collaborated with arbitrary time series forecasting methods. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that LIFT improves the state-of-the-art methods by 5.5% in average forecasting performance.

In particular, we consider the effect of noise in communicated vehicle acceleration from the predecessor vehicle to the follower vehicle on the selection of the time headway in predecessor-follower type vehicle platooning with a Constant Time Headway Policy (CTHP). Employing a CTHP based control law for each vehicle that utilizes on-board sensors for measurement of position and velocity of the predecessor vehicle and wireless communication network for obtaining the acceleration of the predecessor vehicle, we investigate how time headway is affected by communicated signal noise. We derive constraints on the CTHP controller gains for predecessor acceleration, velocity error and spacing error and a lower bound on the time headway which will ensure robust string stability of the platoon against signal noise. We provide comparative numerical simulations on an example to illustrate the main result.</p></details> |  |
| **[Almost Optimal Time Lower Bound for Approximating Parameterized Clique, CSP, and More, under ETH](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08870v1)** | 2024-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Parameterized Inapproximability Hypothesis (PIH), which is an analog of the PCP theorem in parameterized complexity, asserts that, there is a constant $\varepsilon> 0$ such that for any computable function $f:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$, no $f(k)\cdot n^{O(1)}$-time algorithm can, on input a $k$-variable CSP instance with domain size $n$, find an assignment satisfying $1-\varepsilon$ fraction of the constraints. A recent work by Guruswami, Lin, Ren, Sun, and Wu (STOC'24) established PIH under the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH). In this work, we improve the quantitative aspects of PIH and prove (under ETH) that approximating sparse parameterized CSPs within a constant factor requires $n^{k^{1-o(1)}}$ time. This immediately implies that, assuming ETH, finding a $(k/2)$-clique in an $n$-vertex graph with a $k$-clique requires $n^{k^{1-o(1)}}$ time. We also prove almost optimal time lower bounds for approximating $k$-ExactCover and Max $k$-Coverage. Our proof follows the blueprint of the previous work to identify a "vector-structured" ETH-hard CSP whose satisfiability can be checked via an appropriate form of "parallel" PCP. Using further ideas in the reduction, we guarantee additional structures for constraints in the CSP. We then leverage this to design a parallel PCP of almost linear size based on Reed-Muller codes and derandomized low degree testing.</p></details> |  |

For this purpose, real-time and accurate guidewire segmentation and tracking can enhance the visualization of guidewires and provide visual feedback for physicians during the intervention as well as for robot-assisted interventions. Nevertheless, this task often comes with the challenge of elongated deformable structures that present themselves with low contrast in the noisy fluoroscopic image sequences. To address these issues, a two-stage deep learning framework for real-time guidewire segmentation and tracking is proposed. In the first stage, a Yolov5s detector is trained, using the original X-ray images as well as synthetic ones, which is employed to output the bounding boxes of possible target guidewires. More importantly, a refinement module based on spatiotemporal constraints is incorporated to robustly localize the guidewire and remove false detections. In the second stage, a novel and efficient network is proposed to segment the guidewire in each detected bounding box. The network contains two major modules, namely a hessian-based enhancement embedding module and a dual self-attention module. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on clinical intra-operative images demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms our baselines as well as the current state of the art and, in comparison, shows higher robustness to low quality images.</p></details> |  |

These activities, however, may not always yield productive outcomes due to the diversity of student mental models and their ineffective collaboration. In this work, we introduce VizGroup, an AI-assisted system that enables programming instructors to easily oversee students' real-time collaborative learning behaviors during large programming courses. VizGroup leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to recommend event specifications for instructors so that they can simultaneously track and receive alerts about key correlation patterns between various collaboration metrics and ongoing coding tasks. We evaluated VizGroup with 12 instructors using a dataset collected from a Peer Instruction activity that was conducted in a large programming lecture. The results showed that compared to a version of VizGroup without the suggested units, VizGroup with suggested units helped instructors create additional monitoring units on previously undetected patterns on their own, covered a more diverse range of metrics, and influenced the participants' following notification creation strategies.</p></details> |  |

Test-Time Training (TTT) methods have recently gained popularity by their ability to enhance the robustness of models through the addition of an auxiliary objective that is jointly optimized with the main task. Being strictly unsupervised, this auxiliary objective is used at test time to adapt the model without any access to labels. In this work, we propose Noise-Contrastive Test-Time Training (NC-TTT), a novel unsupervised TTT technique based on the discrimination of noisy feature maps. By learning to classify noisy views of projected feature maps, and then adapting the model accordingly on new domains, classification performance can be recovered by an important margin. Experiments on several popular test-time adaptation baselines demonstrate the advantages of our method compared to recent approaches for this task.

However, their recursive structure impedes end-to-end training of these systems using automatic differentiation. Although non-recursive filter approximations like frequency sampling and frame-based processing have been proposed and widely used in previous works, they cannot accurately reflect the gradient of the original system. We alleviate this difficulty by re-expressing a time-varying all-pole filter to backpropagate the gradients through itself, so the filter implementation is not bound to the technical limitations of automatic differentiation frameworks. This implementation can be employed within any audio system containing filters with poles for efficient gradient evaluation. We demonstrate its training efficiency and expressive capabilities for modelling real-world dynamic audio systems on a phaser, time-varying subtractive synthesiser, and feed-forward compressor.

These tools typically rely on evaluating a single time point, overlook the time ordering of inputs, and neglect the time-sensitive nature of time series applications. These factors make it difficult for users, particularly those without domain knowledge, to comprehend AI model decisions and obtain meaningful explanations. We propose CGS-Mask, a post-hoc and model-agnostic cellular genetic strip mask-based saliency approach to address these challenges. CGS-Mask uses consecutive time steps as a cohesive entity to evaluate the impact of features on the final prediction, providing binary and sustained feature importance scores over time. Our algorithm optimizes the mask population iteratively to obtain the optimal mask in a reasonable time. We evaluated CGS-Mask on synthetic and real-world datasets, and it outperformed state-of-the-art methods in elucidating the importance of features over time. According to our pilot user study via a questionnaire survey, CGS-Mask is the most effective approach in presenting easily understandable time series prediction results, enabling users to comprehend the decision-making process of AI models with ease.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI24 |
| **[Neural Likelihood Approximation for Integer Valued Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12544v2)** | 2024-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic processes defined on integer valued state spaces are popular within the physical and biological sciences. These models are necessary for capturing the dynamics of small systems where the individual nature of the populations cannot be ignored and stochastic effects are important. The inference of the parameters of such models, from time series data, is challenging due to intractability of the likelihood. To work at all, current simulation based inference methods require the generation of realisations of the model conditional on the data, which can be both tricky to implement and computationally expensive. In this paper we instead construct a neural likelihood approximation that can be trained using unconditional simulation of the underlying model, which is much simpler. We demonstrate our method by performing inference on a number of ecological and epidemiological models, showing that we can accurately approximate the true posterior while achieving significant computational speed ups compared to current best methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Systematic Construction Approach for All $4\times 4$ Involutory MDS Matrices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08250v1)** | 2024-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maximum distance separable (MDS) matrices play a crucial role not only in coding theory but also in the design of block ciphers and hash functions. Of particular interest are involutory MDS matrices, which facilitate the use of a single circuit for both encryption and decryption in hardware implementations. In this article, we present several characterizations of involutory MDS matrices of even order. Additionally, we introduce a new matrix form for obtaining all involutory MDS matrices of even order and compare it with other matrix forms available in the literature. We then propose a technique to systematically construct all $4 \times 4$ involutory MDS matrices over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$. This method significantly reduces the search space by focusing on involutory MDS class representative matrices, leading to the generation of all such matrices within a substantially smaller set compared to considering all $4 \times 4$ involutory matrices. Specifically, our approach involves searching for these representative matrices within a set of cardinality $(2^m-1)^5$. Through this method, we provide an explicit enumeration of the total number of $4 \times 4$ involutory MDS matrices over $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ for $m=3,4,\ldots,8$.</p></details> |  |

The primary challenge in this domain is to develop representations capable of discerning anomalies effectively. The prevalent methods for anomaly detection in the literature are predominantly reconstruction-based and predictive in nature. However, they typically concentrate on a single-dimensional instance level, thereby not fully harnessing the complex associations inherent in industrial MTS. To address this issue, we propose a novel self-supervised hierarchical contrastive consistency learning method for detecting anomalies in MTS, named HCL-MTSAD. It innovatively leverages data consistency at multiple levels inherent in industrial MTS, systematically capturing consistent associations across four latent levels-measurement, sample, channel, and process. By developing a multi-layer contrastive loss, HCL-MTSAD can extensively mine data consistency and spatio-temporal association, resulting in more informative representations. Subsequently, an anomaly discrimination module, grounded in self-supervised hierarchical contrastive learning, is designed to detect timestamp-level anomalies by calculating multi-scale data consistency. Extensive experiments conducted on six diverse MTS datasets retrieved from real cyber-physical systems and server machines, in comparison with 20 baselines, indicate that HCL-MTSAD's anomaly detection capability outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmark models by an average of 1.8\% in terms of F1 score.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, under review by IEEE Internet of Things Journal</p></details> |

This assumption immensely limits their applications to Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) that typically navigate in dynamic environments. To address this limitation, we present OkayPlan, a GPP algorithm capable of generating safe and short paths in dynamic scenarios at a real-time executing speed (125 Hz on a desktop-class computer). Specifically, we approach the challenge of dynamic obstacle avoidance by formulating the path planning problem as an Obstacle Kinematics Augmented Optimization Problem (OKAOP), which can be efficiently resolved through a PSO-based optimizer at a real-time speed. Meanwhile, a Dynamic Prioritized Initialization (DPI) mechanism that adaptively initializes potential solutions for the optimization problem is established to further ameliorate the solution quality. Additionally, a relaxation strategy that facilitates the autonomous tuning of OkayPlan's hyperparameters in dynamic environments is devised. Comprehensive experiments, including comparative evaluations, ablation studies, and \textcolor{black}{applications to 3D physical simulation platforms}, have been conducted to substantiate the efficacy of our approach. Results indicate that OkayPlan outstrips existing methods in terms of path safety, length optimality, and computational efficiency, establishing it as a potent GPP technique for dynamic environments.

We study the problem of placing decoys in AD network to detect potential attacks. We model the problem as a Stackelberg game between an attacker and a defender on AD attack graphs where the defender employs a set of decoys to detect the attacker on their way to Domain Admin (DA). Contrary to previous works, we consider time-varying (temporal) attack graphs. We proposed a novel metric called response time, to measure the effectiveness of our decoy placement in temporal attack graphs. Response time is defined as the duration from the moment attackers trigger the first decoy to when they compromise the DA. Our goal is to maximize the defender's response time to the worst-case attack paths. We establish the NP-hard nature of the defender's optimization problem, leading us to develop Evolutionary Diversity Optimization (EDO) algorithms. EDO algorithms identify diverse sets of high-quality solutions for the optimization problem. Despite the polynomial nature of the fitness function, it proves experimentally slow for larger graphs. To enhance scalability, we proposed an algorithm that exploits the static nature of AD infrastructure in the temporal setting. Then, we introduce tailored repair operations, ensuring the convergence to better results while maintaining scalability for larger graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be appear in ACM GECCO 2024</p></details> |

However, differences in recruitment practices and regional demographics often lead to variations in study participant characteristics, potentially biasing treatment effect estimates and undermining treatment effect consistency assessment across regions. To address this challenge, we propose novel estimators and inference methods utilizing inverse probability of sampling and calibration weighting. Our approaches aim to eliminate exogenous regional imbalance while preserving intrinsic differences across regions, such as race and genetic variants. Moreover, time-to-event outcomes in MRCT studies receive limited attention, with existing methodologies primarily focusing on hazard ratios. In this paper, we adopt restricted mean survival time to characterize the treatment effect, offering more straightforward interpretations of treatment effects with fewer assumptions than hazard ratios. Theoretical results are established for the proposed estimators, supported by extensive simulation studies. We illustrate the effectiveness of our methods through a real MRCT case study on acute coronary syndromes.</p></details> |  |

Current traffic monitoring systems confront major difficulty in recognizing small objects and pedestrians effectively in real-time, posing a serious risk to public safety and contributing to traffic inefficiency. Recognizing these difficulties, our project focuses on the creation and validation of an advanced deep-learning framework capable of processing complex visual input for precise, real-time recognition of cars and people in a variety of environmental situations. On a dataset representing complicated urban settings, we trained and evaluated different versions of the YOLOv8 and RT-DETR models. The YOLOv8 Large version proved to be the most effective, especially in pedestrian recognition, with great precision and robustness. The results, which include Mean Average Precision and recall rates, demonstrate the model's ability to dramatically improve traffic monitoring and safety. This study makes an important addition to real-time, reliable detection in computer vision, establishing new benchmarks for traffic management systems.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |

State-of-the-art algorithms are predominantly based on the approach to share encoded fragments of the broadcast message, yielding an asymptotically optimal communication complexity when the message size exceeds the network size, a condition frequently encountered in practice. However, algorithms following the standard coding approach incur an overhead factor of at least 3, which can already be a burden for bandwidth-constrained applications. Minimizing this overhead is an important objective with immediate benefits to protocols that use a reliable broadcast routine as a building block. This paper introduces a novel mechanism to lower the communication and computational complexity. Two algorithms are presented that employ this mechanism to reliably broadcast messages in an asynchronous network where less than a third of all nodes are Byzantine. The first algorithm reduces the overhead factor to 2 and has a time complexity of 3 if the sender is honest, whereas the second algorithm attains an optimal time complexity of 2 with the same overhead factor in the absence of equivocation. Moreover, an optimization for real-world implementations is proposed, reducing the overhead factor to 3/2 under normal operation. Lastly, a lower bound is proved that an overhead factor lower than 3/2 cannot be achieved for a relevant class of reliable broadcast algorithms.</p></details> | 17 pages, 1 figure |

In this paper we propose a way to color cliques with tree and forest backbones in linear time that the largest color does not exceed $\max\{n, 2 \lambda\} + \Delta(H)^2 \lceil\log{n} \rceil$. This result improves on the previously existing approximation algorithms as it is $(\Delta(H)^2 \lceil\log{n} \rceil)$-absolutely approximate, i.e. with an additive error over the optimum. We also present an infinite family of trees $T$ with $\Delta(T) = 3$ for which the coloring of cliques with backbones $T$ require to use at least $\max\{n, 2 \lambda\} + \Omega(\log{n})$ colors for $\lambda$ close to $\frac{n}{2}$.</p></details> | 21 pages, 3 figures |

The associated challenges are exacerbated when solutions to these interconnected problems need to both maximize task performance and respect practical constraints on time and resources. In this work, we formulate a new class of spatio-temporal heterogeneous task allocation problems that consider these complexities. We contribute a novel framework, named Quality-Optimized Incremental Task Allocation Graph Search (Q-ITAGS), to solve such problems. Q-ITAGS builds upon our prior work in trait-based coordination and offers a flexible interleaved framework that i) explicitly models and optimizes the effect of collective capabilities on task performance via learnable trait-quality maps, and ii) respects both resource constraints and spatio-temporal constraints, including a user-specified time budget (i.e., maximum makespan). In addition to algorithmic contributions, we derive theoretical suboptimality bounds in terms of task performance that varies as a function of a single hyperparameter. Our detailed experiments involving a simulated emergency response task and a real-world video game dataset reveal that i) Q-ITAGS results in superior team performance compared to a state-of-the-art method, while also respecting complex spatio-temporal and resource constraints, ii) Q-ITAGS efficiently learns trait-quality maps to enable effective trade-off between task performance and resource constraints, and iii) Q-ITAGS' suboptimality bounds consistently hold in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.13092</p></details> |

In this paper, we present a novel approach to jerk-constrained time-optimal trajectory planning (TOTP), which follows a specified path while satisfying up to third-order constraints to ensure safety and smooth motion. One significant challenge in jerk-constrained TOTP is a non-convex formulation arising from the inclusion of third-order constraints. Approximating inequality constraints can be particularly challenging because the resulting solutions may violate the actual constraints. We address this problem by leveraging convexity within the proposed formulation to form conservative inequality constraints. We then obtain the desired trajectories by solving an $\boldsymbol n$-dimensional Sequential Linear Program (SLP) iteratively until convergence. Lastly, we evaluate in a real robot the performance of trajectories generated with and without jerk limits in terms of peak power, torque efficiency, and tracking capability.</p></details> |  |

The algorithm is within the querying framework of Angluin's $L^*$ algorithm and follows the idea proposed in existing work on the active learning of deterministic one-clock timed automata. We introduce an equivalence relation over the reset-clocked language of a timed automaton and then transform the learning problem into learning the corresponding reset-clocked language of the target automaton. Since a reset-clocked language includes the clock reset information which is not observable, we first present the approach of learning from a powerful teacher who can provide reset information by answering reset information queries from the learner. Then we extend the algorithm in a normal teacher situation in which the learner can only ask standard membership query and equivalence query while the learner guesses the reset information. We prove that the learning algorithm terminates and returns a correct deterministic timed automaton. Due to the need of guessing whether the clocks reset at the transitions, the algorithm is of exponential complexity in the size of the target automaton.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages.

Thus, comprehension of traffic signs is essential for road safety and ignorance may result in road accidents. Traffic sign detection has been a research spotlight over the past few decades. Real-time and accurate detections are the preliminaries of robust traffic sign detection system which is yet to be achieved. This study presents a voice-assisted real-time traffic sign recognition system which is capable of assisting drivers. This system functions under two subsystems. Initially, the detection and recognition of the traffic signs are carried out using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). After recognizing the specific traffic sign, it is narrated to the driver as a voice message using a text-to-speech engine. An efficient CNN model for a benchmark dataset is developed for real-time detection and recognition using Deep Learning techniques. The advantage of this system is that even if the driver misses a traffic sign, or does not look at the traffic sign, or is unable to comprehend the sign, the system detects it and narrates it to the driver. A system of this type is also important in the development of autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |

It leverages pre-trained 2D diffusion models as teacher to guide the reconstruction of student 3D models. Despite their remarkable success, SDS-based methods often encounter geometric artifacts and texture saturation. We find out the crux is the overlooked indiscriminate treatment of diffusion time-steps during optimization: it unreasonably treats the student-teacher knowledge distillation to be equal at all time-steps and thus entangles coarse-grained and fine-grained modeling. Therefore, we propose the Diffusion Time-step Curriculum one-image-to-3D pipeline (DTC123), which involves both the teacher and student models collaborating with the time-step curriculum in a coarse-to-fine manner. Extensive experiments on NeRF4, RealFusion15, GSO and Level50 benchmark demonstrate that DTC123 can produce multi-view consistent, high-quality, and diverse 3D assets.

Long term missions, such as NASA's Landsat, Terra, and Aqua satellites, and more recently, the ESA's Sentinel missions, record images of the entire world every few days. Although single images provide point-in-time data, repeated images of the same area, or satellite image time series (SITS) provide information about the changing state of vegetation and land use. These SITS are useful for modeling dynamic processes and seasonal changes such as plant phenology. They have potential benefits for many aspects of land and natural resource management, including applications in agricultural, forest, water, and disaster management, urban planning, and mining. However, the resulting satellite image time series (SITS) are complex, incorporating information from the temporal, spatial, and spectral dimensions. Therefore, deep learning methods are often deployed as they can analyze these complex relationships. This review presents a summary of the state-of-the-art methods of modelling environmental, agricultural, and other Earth observation variables from SITS data using deep learning methods. We aim to provide a resource for remote sensing experts interested in using deep learning techniques to enhance Earth observation models with temporal information.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

Despite recent advancements in deep neural network (DNN)-based object detectors, their susceptibility to detection errors, particularly in the less-explored realm of 3D object detection, remains a significant concern. State-of-the-art integrity monitoring (also known as introspection) mechanisms in 2D object detection mainly utilise the activation patterns in the final layer of the DNN-based detector's backbone. However, that may not sufficiently address the complexities and sparsity of data in 3D object detection. To this end, we conduct, in this article, an extensive investigation into the effects of activation patterns extracted from various layers of the backbone network for introspecting the operation of 3D object detectors. Through a comparative analysis using Kitti and NuScenes datasets with PointPillars and CenterPoint detectors, we demonstrate that using earlier layers' activation patterns enhances the error detection performance of the integrity monitoring system, yet increases computational complexity. To address the real-time operation requirements in ADS, we also introduce a novel introspection method that combines activation patterns from multiple layers of the detector's backbone and report its performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024 Workshop on Safe Autonomy for All Domains (SAIAD)</p></details> |

The function of interest is modeled by a convex combination of selected basis functions to satisfy the shape constraints, where the time-varying convex weights on simplex follow the dynamic multi-logit models. For the complicated likelihood of this model, a novel data augmentation technique is devised to enable posterior computation by an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The proposed method is applied to the estimation of time-varying Lorenz curves, and its utility is illustrated through numerical experiments and analysis of panel data of household incomes in Japan.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

The optimization problem is defined over a network that collectively minimizes a separable cost function with coupled linear constraints. An equivalent optimization problem with auxiliary decision variables and a decoupling structure is proposed. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the subgradient information can be computed using local information. This then leads to a subgradient algorithm for updating the auxiliary variables. A case with sparse coupling constraints is further considered, and it is shown to have better memory and communication efficiency. For the specific case of a CBF-induced time-varying quadratic program (QP), an update law is proposed that achieves finite-time convergence. Numerical results involving a static resource allocation problem and a safe coordination problem for a multi-agent system demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.</p></details> |  |

The main originality of DynForest is that it handles time-dependent predictors that can be endogeneous (i.e., impacted by the outcome process), measured with error and measured at subject-specific times. At each recursive step of the tree building process, the time-dependent predictors are internally summarized into individual features on which the split can be done. This is achieved using flexible linear mixed models (thanks to the R package lcmm) which specification is pre-specified by the user. DynForest returns the mean for continuous outcome, the category with a majority vote for categorical outcome or the cumulative incidence function over time for survival outcome. DynForest also computes variable importance and minimal depth to inform on the most predictive variables or groups of variables. This paper aims to guide the user with step-by-step examples for fitting random forests using DynForest.</p></details> |  |

Examples of such risks include the maximum average or 90% quantile of the current along a transmission line in any 5-minute window. This work casts the time-windowed risk analysis problem as an infinite-dimensional linear program in occupation measures. In particular, we employ the coherent risk measures of the mean and the expected shortfall (conditional value at risk) to define the maximal time-windowed risk along trajectories. The infinite-dimensional linear program must then be truncated into finite-dimensional optimization problems, such as by using the moment-sum of squares hierarchy of semidefinite programs. The infinite-dimensional linear program will have the same optimal value as the original nonconvex risk estimation task under compactness and regularity assumptions, and the sequence of semidefinite programs will converge to the true value under additional properties of algebraic characterization. The scheme is demonstrated for risk analysis of example stochastic processes.</p></details> | 26 pages, 11 figures |

Previous single-stage TAD methods primarily rely on frame prediction, making them vulnerable to interference from dynamic backgrounds induced by the rapid movement of the dashboard camera. While two-stage TAD methods appear to be a natural solution to mitigate such interference by pre-extracting background-independent features (such as bounding boxes and optical flow) using perceptual algorithms, they are susceptible to the performance of first-stage perceptual algorithms and may result in error propagation. In this paper, we introduce TTHF, a novel single-stage method aligning video clips with text prompts, offering a new perspective on traffic anomaly detection. Unlike previous approaches, the supervised signal of our method is derived from languages rather than orthogonal one-hot vectors, providing a more comprehensive representation. Further, concerning visual representation, we propose to model the high frequency of driving videos in the temporal domain. This modeling captures the dynamic changes of driving scenes, enhances the perception of driving behavior, and significantly improves the detection of traffic anomalies. In addition, to better perceive various types of traffic anomalies, we carefully design an attentive anomaly focusing mechanism that visually and linguistically guides the model to adaptively focus on the visual context of interest, thereby facilitating the detection of traffic anomalies. It is shown that our proposed TTHF achieves promising performance, outperforming state-of-the-art competitors by +5.4% AUC on the DoTA dataset and achieving high generalization on the DADA dataset.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

However, recent studies have not sufficiently leveraged essential temporal information from videos, simply averaging frame-wise representations or referencing consecutive frames. We introduce Temporally Contextualized CLIP (TC-CLIP), a pioneering framework for video understanding that effectively and efficiently leverages comprehensive video information. We propose Temporal Contextualization (TC), a novel layer-wise temporal information infusion mechanism for video that extracts core information from each frame, interconnects relevant information across the video to summarize into context tokens, and ultimately leverages the context tokens during the feature encoding process. Furthermore, our Video-conditional Prompting (VP) module manufactures context tokens to generate informative prompts in text modality. We conduct extensive experiments in zero-shot, few-shot, base-to-novel, and fully-supervised action recognition to validate the superiority of our TC-CLIP. Ablation studies for TC and VP guarantee our design choices.

A multitude of methods exist within this domain, including point-based, range-image-based, polar-coordinate-based, and hybrid strategies. Among these, range-image-based techniques have gained widespread adoption in practical applications due to their efficiency. However, they face a significant challenge known as the ``many-to-one'' problem caused by the range image's limited horizontal and vertical angular resolution. As a result, around 20% of the 3D points can be occluded. In this paper, we present TFNet, a range-image-based LiDAR semantic segmentation method that utilizes temporal information to address this issue. Specifically, we incorporate a temporal fusion layer to extract useful information from previous scans and integrate it with the current scan. We then design a max-voting-based post-processing technique to correct false predictions, particularly those caused by the ``many-to-one'' issue. We evaluated the approach on two benchmarks and demonstrated that the plug-in post-processing technique is generic and can be applied to various networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by CVPR2024 Workshop on Autonomous Driving</p></details> |
| **[Tri-modal Confluence with Temporal Dynamics for Scene Graph Generation in Operating Rooms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09231v1)** | 2024-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A comprehensive understanding of surgical scenes allows for monitoring of the surgical process, reducing the occurrence of accidents and enhancing efficiency for medical professionals. Semantic modeling within operating rooms, as a scene graph generation (SGG) task, is challenging since it involves consecutive recognition of subtle surgical actions over prolonged periods. To address this challenge, we propose a Tri-modal (i.e., images, point clouds, and language) confluence with Temporal dynamics framework, termed TriTemp-OR. Diverging from previous approaches that integrated temporal information via memory graphs, our method embraces two advantages: 1) we directly exploit bi-modal temporal information from the video streaming for hierarchical feature interaction, and 2) the prior knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) is embedded to alleviate the class-imbalance problem in the operating theatre. Specifically, our model performs temporal interactions across 2D frames and 3D point clouds, including a scale-adaptive multi-view temporal interaction (ViewTemp) and a geometric-temporal point aggregation (PointTemp). Furthermore, we transfer knowledge from the biomedical LLM, LLaVA-Med, to deepen the comprehension of intraoperative relations. The proposed TriTemp-OR enables the aggregation of tri-modal features through relation-aware unification to predict relations so as to generate scene graphs. Experimental results on the 4D-OR benchmark demonstrate the superior performance of our model for long-term OR streaming.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, both architectures have inherent shortcomings. Recently, the Mamba architecture, based on state space models, has shown remarkable performance in a series of natural language processing tasks, which can effectively compensate for the shortcomings of the above two architectures. In this paper, we explore for the first time the potential of the Mamba architecture for remote sensing CD tasks. We tailor the corresponding frameworks, called MambaBCD, MambaSCD, and MambaBDA, for binary change detection (BCD), semantic change detection (SCD), and building damage assessment (BDA), respectively. All three frameworks adopt the cutting-edge Visual Mamba architecture as the encoder, which allows full learning of global spatial contextual information from the input images. For the change decoder, which is available in all three architectures, we propose three spatio-temporal relationship modeling mechanisms, which can be naturally combined with the Mamba architecture and fully utilize its attribute to achieve spatio-temporal interaction of multi-temporal features, thereby obtaining accurate change information. On five benchmark datasets, our proposed frameworks outperform current CNN- and Transformer-based approaches without using any complex training strategies or tricks, fully demonstrating the potential of the Mamba architecture in CD tasks. Specifically, we obtained 83.11%, 88.39% and 94.19% F1 scores on the three BCD datasets SYSU, LEVIR-CD+, and WHU-CD; on the SCD dataset SECOND, we obtained 24.11% SeK; and on the BDA dataset xBD, we obtained 81.41% overall F1 score. Further experiments show that our architecture is quite robust to degraded data. The source code will be available in https://github.com/ChenHongruixuan/MambaCD</p></details> |  |

However, we found that inherent heterogeneity among factor tensors in tensor decomposition significantly hinders the tensor fusion process and further limits the performance of link prediction. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel method that maps factor tensors onto a unified smooth Lie group manifold to make the distribution of factor tensors approximating homogeneous in tensor decomposition. We provide the theoretical proof of our motivation that homogeneous tensors are more effective than heterogeneous tensors in tensor fusion and approximating the target for tensor decomposition based TKGE methods. The proposed method can be directly integrated into existing tensor decomposition based TKGE methods without introducing extra parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in mitigating the heterogeneity and in enhancing the tensor decomposition based TKGE models.</p></details> |  |

Existing research often overlooks the peer effect, the mutual influence of M&A behaviors among firms, and fails to capture complex interdependencies within industry networks. Common approaches suffer from reliance on ad-hoc feature engineering, data truncation leading to significant information loss, reduced predictive accuracy, and challenges in real-world application. Additionally, the rarity of M&A events necessitates data rebalancing in conventional models, introducing bias and undermining prediction reliability. We propose an innovative M&A predictive model utilizing the Temporal Dynamic Industry Network (TDIN), leveraging temporal point processes and deep learning to adeptly capture industry-wide M&A dynamics. This model facilitates accurate, detailed deal-level predictions without arbitrary data manipulation or rebalancing, demonstrated through superior evaluation results from M&A cases between January 1997 and December 2020. Our approach marks a significant improvement over traditional models by providing detailed insights into M&A activities and strategic recommendations for specific firms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Data ...</summary><p>Data Processing Code: https://github.com/dayuyang1999/Merger_Acquisition_Data Modeling Code: https://github.com/dayuyang1999/Merger_Acquisition_Prediction</p></details> |

Moreover, the long-tailed distribution of visual relationships is a crucial bottleneck for most dynamic SGG methods. This is because many of them focus on capturing spatio-temporal context using complex architectures, leading to the generation of biased scene graphs. To address these challenges, we propose FloCoDe: Flow-aware Temporal Consistency and Correlation Debiasing with uncertainty attenuation for unbiased dynamic scene graphs. FloCoDe employs feature warping using flow to detect temporally consistent objects across frames. To address the long-tail issue of visual relationships, we propose correlation debiasing and a label correlation-based loss to learn unbiased relation representations for long-tailed classes. Specifically, we propose to incorporate label correlations using contrastive loss to capture commonly co-occurring relations, which aids in learning robust representations for long-tailed classes. Further, we adopt the uncertainty attenuation-based classifier framework to handle noisy annotations in the SGG data. Extensive experimental evaluation shows a performance gain as high as 4.1%, demonstrating the superiority of generating more unbiased scene graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2024 SG2RL, 11 pages, 5 tables, 4 figures</p></details> |

Addressing this distinctive attribute, we propose a Multi-Scale Spatio-temporal CNN-Transformer network (MSSTNet). Our approach takes spatial features of different scales extracted by CNN and feeds them into a Multi-scale Embedding Layer (MELayer). The MELayer extracts multi-scale spatial information and encodes these features before sending them into a Temporal Transformer (T-Former). The T-Former simultaneously extracts temporal information while continually integrating multi-scale spatial information. This process culminates in the generation of multi-scale spatio-temporal features that are utilized for the final classification. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on two in-the-wild datasets. Furthermore, a series of ablation experiments and visualizations provide further validation of our approach's proficiency in leveraging spatio-temporal information within DFER.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2024 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2024)</p></details> |

Specifically, we leverage temporal logic trees constructed using Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis to (1) check for the existence of control policies that complete a specified task and (2) develop a computationally-efficient approach to synthesize the full set of control inputs the CPS can implement in real-time to ensure the task is completed. We show that, by checking the approximation directions of each state set in the temporal logic tree, we can check if the temporal logic tree suffers from the "leaking corner issue," where the intersection of reachable sets yields an incorrect approximation. By ensuring a temporal logic tree has no leaking corners, we know the temporal logic tree correctly verifies the existence of control policies that satisfy the specified task. After confirming the existence of control policies, we show that we can leverage the value functions obtained through Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis to efficiently compute the set of control inputs the CPS can implement throughout the deployment time horizon to guarantee the completion of the specified task. Finally, we use a newly released Python toolbox to evaluate the presented approach on a simulated driving task.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the huge cost of multi-temporal images acquisition and labeling, existing change detection datasets are small in quantity, short in temporal, and low in practicability. Therefore, a large-scale practical-oriented dataset covering wide temporal phases is urgently needed to facilitate the community. To this end, the ChangeNet dataset is presented especially for multi-temporal change detection, along with the new task of "Asymmetric Change Detection". Specifically, ChangeNet consists of 31,000 multi-temporal images pairs, a wide range of complex scenes from 100 cities, and 6 pixel-level annotated categories, which is far superior to all the existing change detection datasets including LEVIR-CD, WHU Building CD, etc.. In addition, ChangeNet contains amounts of real-world perspective distortions in different temporal phases on the same areas, which is able to promote the practical application of change detection algorithms. The ChangeNet dataset is suitable for both binary change detection (BCD) and semantic change detection (SCD) tasks. Accordingly, we benchmark the ChangeNet dataset on six BCD methods and two SCD methods, and extensive experiments demonstrate its challenges and great significance.

We study the problem of placing decoys in AD network to detect potential attacks. We model the problem as a Stackelberg game between an attacker and a defender on AD attack graphs where the defender employs a set of decoys to detect the attacker on their way to Domain Admin (DA). Contrary to previous works, we consider time-varying (temporal) attack graphs. We proposed a novel metric called response time, to measure the effectiveness of our decoy placement in temporal attack graphs. Response time is defined as the duration from the moment attackers trigger the first decoy to when they compromise the DA. Our goal is to maximize the defender's response time to the worst-case attack paths. We establish the NP-hard nature of the defender's optimization problem, leading us to develop Evolutionary Diversity Optimization (EDO) algorithms. EDO algorithms identify diverse sets of high-quality solutions for the optimization problem. Despite the polynomial nature of the fitness function, it proves experimentally slow for larger graphs. To enhance scalability, we proposed an algorithm that exploits the static nature of AD infrastructure in the temporal setting. Then, we introduce tailored repair operations, ensuring the convergence to better results while maintaining scalability for larger graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be appear in ACM GECCO 2024</p></details> |
| **[Low-rank Adaptation for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07919v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is crucial in real-world dynamic systems, predicting future changes using historical data from diverse locations. Existing methods often prioritize the development of intricate neural networks to capture the complex dependencies of the data, yet their accuracy fails to show sustained improvement. Besides, these methods also overlook node heterogeneity, hindering customized prediction modules from handling diverse regional nodes effectively. In this paper, our goal is not to propose a new model but to present a novel low-rank adaptation framework as an off-the-shelf plugin for existing spatial-temporal prediction models, termed ST-LoRA, which alleviates the aforementioned problems through node-level adjustments. Specifically, we first tailor a node adaptive low-rank layer comprising multiple trainable low-rank matrices. Additionally, we devise a multi-layer residual fusion stacking module, injecting the low-rank adapters into predictor modules of various models. Across six real-world traffic datasets and six different types of spatio-temporal prediction models, our approach minimally increases the parameters and training time of the original models by less than 4%, still achieving consistent and sustained performance enhancement.</p></details> |  |

The associated challenges are exacerbated when solutions to these interconnected problems need to both maximize task performance and respect practical constraints on time and resources. In this work, we formulate a new class of spatio-temporal heterogeneous task allocation problems that consider these complexities. We contribute a novel framework, named Quality-Optimized Incremental Task Allocation Graph Search (Q-ITAGS), to solve such problems. Q-ITAGS builds upon our prior work in trait-based coordination and offers a flexible interleaved framework that i) explicitly models and optimizes the effect of collective capabilities on task performance via learnable trait-quality maps, and ii) respects both resource constraints and spatio-temporal constraints, including a user-specified time budget (i.e., maximum makespan). In addition to algorithmic contributions, we derive theoretical suboptimality bounds in terms of task performance that varies as a function of a single hyperparameter. Our detailed experiments involving a simulated emergency response task and a real-world video game dataset reveal that i) Q-ITAGS results in superior team performance compared to a state-of-the-art method, while also respecting complex spatio-temporal and resource constraints, ii) Q-ITAGS efficiently learns trait-quality maps to enable effective trade-off between task performance and resource constraints, and iii) Q-ITAGS' suboptimality bounds consistently hold in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.13092</p></details> |

However, MAPF does not account for several practical task-related constraints. For example, agents may need to perform actions at goal locations with specific execution times, adhering to predetermined orders and timeframes. Moreover, goal assignments may not be predefined for agents, and the optimization objective may lack an explicit definition. To incorporate task assignment, path planning, and a user-defined objective into a coherent framework, this paper examines the Task Assignment and Path Finding with Precedence and Temporal Constraints (TAPF-PTC) problem. We augment Conflict-Based Search (CBS) to simultaneously generate task assignments and collision-free paths that adhere to precedence and temporal constraints, maximizing an objective quantified by the return from a user-defined reward function in reinforcement learning (RL). Experimentally, we demonstrate that our algorithm, CBS-TA-PTC, can solve highly challenging bomb-defusing tasks with precedence and temporal constraints efficiently relative to MARL and adapted Target Assignment and Path Finding (TAPF) methods.</p></details> |  |

While numerous studies have aimed at predicting battery lifespan, few have examined the interpretability of their models or how such insights could improve predictions. Addressing this gap, we introduce three innovative models that integrate shallow attention layers into a foundational model from our previous work, which combined elements of recurrent and convolutional neural networks. Utilizing a well-known public dataset, we showcase our methodology's effectiveness. Temporal attention is applied to identify critical timesteps and highlight differences among test cell batches, particularly underscoring the significance of the "rest" phase. Furthermore, by applying cyclic attention via self-attention to context vectors, our approach effectively identifies key cycles, enabling us to strategically decrease the input size for quicker predictions. Employing both single- and multi-head attention mechanisms, we have systematically minimized the required input from 100 to 50 and then to 30 cycles, refining this process based on cyclic attention scores. Our refined model exhibits strong regression capabilities, accurately forecasting the initiation of rapid capacity fade with an average deviation of only 58 cycles by analyzing just the initial 30 cycles of easily accessible input data.</p></details> |  |

We explore various sample selection strategies to retrieve the most relevant set of examples. By using a window-based prompt design approach, we can perform TE normalization across sentences, while leveraging the LLM knowledge without training the model. Our experiments show competitive results to models designed for this task.

Our work is motivated by the observations that road lines and markings are (1) frequently occluded in the presence of moving vehicles, shadow, and glare and (2) highly structured with low intra-class shape variance and overall high appearance consistency. To solve these issues, we propose a Homography Guided Fusion (HomoFusion) module to exploit temporally-adjacent video frames for complementary cues facilitating the correct classification of the partially occluded road lines or markings. To reduce computational complexity, a novel surface normal estimator is proposed to establish spatial correspondences between the sampled frames, allowing the HomoFusion module to perform a pixel-to-pixel attention mechanism in updating the representation of the occluded road lines or markings. Experiments on ApolloScape, a large-scale lane mark segmentation dataset, and ApolloScape Night with artificial simulated night-time road conditions, demonstrate that our method outperforms other existing SOTA lane mark segmentation models with less than 9\% of their parameters and computational complexity. We show that exploiting available camera intrinsic data and ground plane assumption for cross-frame correspondence can lead to a light-weight network with significantly improved performances in speed and accuracy. We also prove the versatility of our HomoFusion approach by applying it to the problem of water puddle segmentation and achieving SOTA performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2023</p></details> |
| **[Test-Time Zero-Shot Temporal Action Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05426v2)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-Shot Temporal Action Localization (ZS-TAL) seeks to identify and locate actions in untrimmed videos unseen during training. Existing ZS-TAL methods involve fine-tuning a model on a large amount of annotated training data. While effective, training-based ZS-TAL approaches assume the availability of labeled data for supervised learning, which can be impractical in some applications. Furthermore, the training process naturally induces a domain bias into the learned model, which may adversely affect the model's generalization ability to arbitrary videos. These considerations prompt us to approach the ZS-TAL problem from a radically novel perspective, relaxing the requirement for training data. To this aim, we introduce a novel method that performs Test-Time adaptation for Temporal Action Localization (T3AL). In a nutshell, T3AL adapts a pre-trained Vision and Language Model (VLM). T3AL operates in three steps. First, a video-level pseudo-label of the action category is computed by aggregating information from the entire video. Then, action localization is performed adopting a novel procedure inspired by self-supervised learning. Finally, frame-level textual descriptions extracted with a state-of-the-art captioning model are employed for refining the action region proposals. We validate the effectiveness of T3AL by conducting experiments on the THUMOS14 and the ActivityNet-v1.3 datasets. Our results demonstrate that T3AL significantly outperforms zero-shot baselines based on state-of-the-art VLMs, confirming the benefit of a test-time adaptation approach.</p></details> | CVPR 2024 |
| **[Deep Temporal Graph Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10738v3)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep graph clustering has recently received significant attention due to its ability to enhance the representation learning capabilities of models in unsupervised scenarios. Nevertheless, deep clustering for temporal graphs, which could capture crucial dynamic interaction information, has not been fully explored. It means that in many clustering-oriented real-world scenarios, temporal graphs can only be processed as static graphs. This not only causes the loss of dynamic information but also triggers huge computational consumption. To solve the problem, we propose a general framework for deep Temporal Graph Clustering called TGC, which introduces deep clustering techniques to suit the interaction sequence-based batch-processing pattern of temporal graphs. In addition, we discuss differences between temporal graph clustering and static graph clustering from several levels. To verify the superiority of the proposed framework TGC, we conduct extensive experiments. The experimental results show that temporal graph clustering enables more flexibility in finding a balance between time and space requirements, and our framework can effectively improve the performance of existing temporal graph learning methods.

In the context of control, we seek the control action directing the stochastic flow toward spatio-temporal probabilistic constraints. To this end, we derive a new Schr\"odinger system of coupled, in space and time, partial differential equations to construct the solution of the proposed problem. Further, we show that a Fortet-Sinkhorn type of algorithm is, once again, available to attain the associated bridge. A key feature of the framework is that the obtained bridge retains the Markovian structure in the prior process, and thereby, the corresponding control action takes the form of state feedback.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |

The Richards equation is used to describe unsaturated flow, while the advection-dispersion equation (ADE) is used for modeling solute transport. The standard finite element discretization in space is utilized and four time-stepping methods are studied. Three of these methods require an iterative resolution to solve the Richards equation in its mixed form. In the remaining method, a novel technique is proposed to linearize the system of equations in time, and the iterative processes are avoided. In this method, a free stabilized parameter is introduced. Numerical tests are conducted to analyze the accuracy and efficiency of methods. The developed linear scheme based on the optimal free parameter is accurate and performs better in terms of efficiency since it offers a considerable gain in computational time compared to the other methods. The reliability and effectiveness of the developed semi-implicit scheme are investigated using numerical experiments for modeling water flow and solute transport in unsaturated soils.</p></details> |  |

Our main result is a sharp threshold on the size of any maximum $\delta$-clique (namely a clique with edges appearing at most $\delta$ apart within [0,1]) in random instances of this model, for any constant~$\delta$. In particular, using the probabilistic method, we prove that the size of a maximum $\delta$-clique is approximately $\frac{2\log{n}}{\log{\frac{1}{\delta}}}$ with high probability (whp). What seems surprising is that, even though the random simple temporal graph contains $\Theta(n^2)$ overlapping $\delta$-windows, which (when viewed separately) correspond to different random instances of the Erdos-Renyi random graphs model, the size of the maximum $\delta$-clique in the former model and the maximum clique size of the latter are approximately the same. Furthermore, we show that the minimum interval containing a $\delta$-clique is $\delta-o(\delta)$ whp. We use this result to show that any polynomial time algorithm for $\delta$-TEMPORAL CLIQUE is unlikely to have very large probability of success.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hysteresis Compensation of Flexible Continuum Manipulator using RGBD Sensing and Temporal Convolutional Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11319v2)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flexible continuum manipulators are valued for minimally invasive surgery, offering access to confined spaces through nonlinear paths. However, cable-driven manipulators face control difficulties due to hysteresis from cabling effects such as friction, elongation, and coupling. These effects are difficult to model due to nonlinearity and the difficulties become even more evident when dealing with long and coupled, multi-segmented manipulator. This paper proposes a data-driven approach based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to capture these nonlinear and previous states-dependent characteristics of cable actuation. We collect physical joint configurations according to command joint configurations using RGBD sensing and 7 fiducial markers to model the hysteresis of the proposed manipulator. Result on a study comparing the estimation performance of four DNN models show that the Temporal Convolution Network (TCN) demonstrates the highest predictive capability. Leveraging trained TCNs, we build a control algorithm to compensate for hysteresis. Tracking tests in task space using unseen trajectories show that the proposed control algorithm reduces the average position and orientation error by 61.39% (from 13.7mm to 5.29 mm) and 64.04% (from 31.17{\deg} to 11.21{\deg}), respectively. This result implies that the proposed calibrated controller effectively reaches the desired configurations by estimating the hysteresis of the manipulator. Applying this method in real surgical scenarios has the potential to enhance control precision and improve surgical performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Recently, there has been an increasing interest in determining gaze direction from facial videos. However, video gaze estimation faces significant challenges, such as understanding the dynamic evolution of gaze in video sequences, dealing with static backgrounds, and adapting to variations in illumination. To address these challenges, we propose a simple and novel deep learning model designed to estimate gaze from videos, incorporating a specialized attention module. Our method employs a spatial attention mechanism that tracks spatial dynamics within videos. This technique enables accurate gaze direction prediction through a temporal sequence model, adeptly transforming spatial observations into temporal insights, thereby significantly improving gaze estimation accuracy. Additionally, our approach integrates Gaussian processes to include individual-specific traits, facilitating the personalization of our model with just a few labeled samples. Experimental results confirm the efficacy of the proposed approach, demonstrating its success in both within-dataset and cross-dataset settings. Specifically, our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Gaze360 dataset, improving by $2.5^\circ$ without personalization.

Despite this, literature about analysing the fitness landscapes induced by surrogate models is limited, and even non-existent for multi-objective problems. This study addresses this critical gap by comparing landscapes of the true fitness function with those of surrogate models for multi-objective functions. Moreover, it does so temporally by examining landscape features at different points in time during optimisation, in the vicinity of the population at that point in time. We consider the BBOB bi-objective benchmark functions in our experiments. The results of the fitness landscape analysis reveals significant differences between true and surrogate features at different time points during optimisation. Despite these differences, the true and surrogate landscape features still show high correlations between each other. Furthermore, this study identifies which landscape features are related to search and demonstrates that both surrogate and true landscape features are capable of predicting algorithm performance. These findings indicate that temporal analysis of the landscape features may help to facilitate the design of surrogate switching approaches to improve performance in multi-objective optimisation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-temporal Aligned SUNet Model for Low-light Video Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02408v2)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distortions caused by low-light conditions are not only visually unpleasant but also degrade the performance of computer vision tasks. The restoration and enhancement have proven to be highly beneficial. However, there are only a limited number of enhancement methods explicitly designed for videos acquired in low-light conditions. We propose a Spatio-Temporal Aligned SUNet (STA-SUNet) model using a Swin Transformer as a backbone to capture low light video features and exploit their spatio-temporal correlations. The STA-SUNet model is trained on a novel, fully registered dataset (BVI), which comprises dynamic scenes captured under varying light conditions. It is further analysed comparatively against various other models over three test datasets. The model demonstrates superior adaptivity across all datasets, obtaining the highest PSNR and SSIM values. It is particularly effective in extreme low-light conditions, yielding fairly good visualisation results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Seasonal Fire Prediction using Spatio-Temporal Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06437v1)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With climate change expected to exacerbate fire weather conditions, the accurate anticipation of wildfires on a global scale becomes increasingly crucial for disaster mitigation. In this study, we utilize SeasFire, a comprehensive global wildfire dataset with climate, vegetation, oceanic indices, and human-related variables, to enable seasonal wildfire forecasting with machine learning. For the predictive analysis, we train deep learning models with different architectures that capture the spatio-temporal context leading to wildfires. Our investigation focuses on assessing the effectiveness of these models in predicting the presence of burned areas at varying forecasting time horizons globally, extending up to six months into the future, and on how different spatial or/and temporal context affects the performance of the models. Our findings demonstrate the great potential of deep learning models in seasonal fire forecasting; longer input time-series leads to more robust predictions across varying forecasting horizons, while integrating spatial information to capture wildfire spatio-temporal dynamics boosts performance. Finally, our results hint that in order to enhance performance at longer forecasting horizons, a larger receptive field spatially needs to be considered.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Local and Global Temporal Contexts for Video Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03330v2)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contextual information plays a core role for video semantic segmentation (VSS). This paper summarizes contexts for VSS in two-fold: local temporal contexts (LTC) which define the contexts from neighboring frames, and global temporal contexts (GTC) which represent the contexts from the whole video. As for LTC, it includes static and motional contexts, corresponding to static and moving content in neighboring frames, respectively. Previously, both static and motional contexts have been studied. However, there is no research about simultaneously learning static and motional contexts (highly complementary). Hence, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine Feature Mining (CFFM) technique to learn a unified presentation of LTC. CFFM contains two parts: Coarse-to-Fine Feature Assembling (CFFA) and Cross-frame Feature Mining (CFM). CFFA abstracts static and motional contexts, and CFM mines useful information from nearby frames to enhance target features. To further exploit more temporal contexts, we propose CFFM++ by additionally learning GTC from the whole video. Specifically, we uniformly sample certain frames from the video and extract global contextual prototypes by k-means. The information within those prototypes is mined by CFM to refine target features. Experimental results on popular benchmarks demonstrate that CFFM and CFFM++ perform favorably against state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Fast and Adaptive Multi-agent Planning under Collaborative Temporal Logic Tasks via Poset Products](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11373v2)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient coordination and planning is essential for large-scale multi-agent systems that collaborate in a shared dynamic environment. Heuristic search methods or learning-based approaches often lack the guarantee on correctness and performance. Moreover, when the collaborative tasks contain both spatial and temporal requirements, e.g., as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas, formal methods provide a verifiable framework for task planning. However, since the planning complexity grows exponentially with the number of agents and the length of the task formula, existing studies are mostly limited to small artificial cases. To address this issue, a new planning paradigm is proposed in this work for system-wide temporal task formulas that are released online and continually. It avoids two common bottlenecks in the traditional methods, i.e., (i) the direct translation of the complete task formula to the associated B\"uchi automaton; and (ii) the synchronized product between the B\"uchi automaton and the transition models of all agents. Instead, an adaptive planning algorithm is proposed that computes the product of relaxed partially-ordered sets (R-posets) on-the-fly, and assigns these subtasks to the agents subject to the ordering constraints. It is shown that the first valid plan can be derived with a polynomial time and memory complexity w.r.t. the system size and the formula length. Our method can take into account task formulas with a length of more than 400 and a fleet with more than $400$ agents, while most existing methods fail at the formula length of 25 within a reasonable duration. The proposed method is validated on large fleets of service robots in both simulation and hardware experiments.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |
| **[NoiseNCA: Noisy Seed Improves Spatio-Temporal Continuity of Neural Cellular Automata](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06279v1)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) is a class of Cellular Automata where the update rule is parameterized by a neural network that can be trained using gradient descent. In this paper, we focus on NCA models used for texture synthesis, where the update rule is inspired by partial differential equations (PDEs) describing reaction-diffusion systems. To train the NCA model, the spatio-termporal domain is discretized, and Euler integration is used to numerically simulate the PDE. However, whether a trained NCA truly learns the continuous dynamic described by the corresponding PDE or merely overfits the discretization used in training remains an open question. We study NCA models at the limit where space-time discretization approaches continuity. We find that existing NCA models tend to overfit the training discretization, especially in the proximity of the initial condition, also called "seed". To address this, we propose a solution that utilizes uniform noise as the initial condition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in preserving the consistency of NCA dynamics across a wide range of spatio-temporal granularities. Our improved NCA model enables two new test-time interactions by allowing continuous control over the speed of pattern formation and the scale of the synthesized patterns. We demonstrate this new NCA feature in our interactive online demo. Our work reveals that NCA models can learn continuous dynamics and opens new venues for NCA research from a dynamical systems' perspective.</p></details> | 9 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Multi-level Association for Video Object Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06265v1)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing semi-supervised video object segmentation methods either focus on temporal feature matching or spatial-temporal feature modeling. However, they do not address the issues of sufficient target interaction and efficient parallel processing simultaneously, thereby constraining the learning of dynamic, target-aware features. To tackle these limitations, this paper proposes a spatial-temporal multi-level association framework, which jointly associates reference frame, test frame, and object features to achieve sufficient interaction and parallel target ID association with a spatial-temporal memory bank for efficient video object segmentation. Specifically, we construct a spatial-temporal multi-level feature association module to learn better target-aware features, which formulates feature extraction and interaction as the efficient operations of object self-attention, reference object enhancement, and test reference correlation. In addition, we propose a spatial-temporal memory to assist feature association and temporal ID assignment and correlation. We evaluate the proposed method by conducting extensive experiments on numerous video object segmentation datasets, including DAVIS 2016/2017 val, DAVIS 2017 test-dev, and YouTube-VOS 2018/2019 val. The favorable performance against the state-of-the-art methods demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. All source code and trained models will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Neural temporal point process (NTPP) has achieved great success in modeling event sequences that occur in continuous time space. However, due to the black-box nature of neural networks, existing NTPP models fall short in explaining the dependencies between different event types. In this paper, inspired by word2vec and Hawkes process, we propose an interpretable framework inf2vec for event sequence modelling, where the event influences are directly parameterized and can be learned end-to-end. In the experiment, we demonstrate the superiority of our model on event prediction as well as type-type influences learning.</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[Multiple Models for Recommending Temporal Aspects of Entities](http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07890v4)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Entity aspect recommendation is an emerging task in semantic search that helps users discover serendipitous and prominent information with respect to an entity, of which salience (e.g., popularity) is the most important factor in previous work. However, entity aspects are temporally dynamic and often driven by events happening over time. For such cases, aspect suggestion based solely on salience features can give unsatisfactory results, for two reasons. First, salience is often accumulated over a long time period and does not account for recency. Second, many aspects related to an event entity are strongly time-dependent. In this paper, we study the task of temporal aspect recommendation for a given entity, which aims at recommending the most relevant aspects and takes into account time in order to improve search experience. We propose a novel event-centric ensemble ranking method that learns from multiple time and type-dependent models and dynamically trades off salience and recency characteristics. Through extensive experiments on real-world query logs, we demonstrate that our method is robust and achieves better effectiveness than competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of the 15th Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC 2018)</p></details> |

Instead of stacking multiple frames along the temporal dimension or recurrently propagating estimated features that will accumulate errors or cannot explore information from far-apart frames, we develop a memory-based feature propagation module that can establish reliable connections with features from far-apart frames and alleviate the influence of inaccurately estimated features. To extract better features from each frame for the above-mentioned feature propagation, we explore the features from large-pretrained visual models to guide the feature estimation of each frame so that the estimated features can model complex scenarios. In addition, we note that adjacent frames usually contain similar contents. To explore this property for better spatial and temporal feature utilization, we develop a local attention module to aggregate the features from adjacent frames in a spatial-temporal neighborhood. We formulate our memory-based feature propagation module, large-pretrained visual model guided feature estimation module, and local attention module into an end-to-end trainable network (named ColorMNet) and show that it performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods on both the benchmark datasets and real-world scenarios.

However, the intricate nature of self-attention introduces practical challenges, as existing state-of-the-art methods often demand high-end GPUs or exhibit slow inference speeds, especially for high-resolution images like 2K. Striking an optimal balance between performance and latency remains a critical concern. In response, this work presents PASTA, a novel Progressively Aggregated Spatio-Temporal Alignment framework for HDR deghosting. Our approach achieves effectiveness and efficiency by harnessing hierarchical representation during feature distanglement. Through the utilization of diverse granularities within the hierarchical structure, our method substantially boosts computational speed and optimizes the HDR imaging workflow. In addition, we explore within-scale feature modeling with local and global attention, gradually merging and refining them in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Experimental results showcase PASTA's superiority over current SOTA methods in both visual quality and performance metrics, accompanied by a substantial 3-fold (x3) increase in inference speed.</p></details> |  |

While traditional knowledge-driven models have their merits, data-driven crowd simulation models promise to bring a new dimension of realism to these simulations. However, most of the existing data-driven models are designed for specific geometries, leading to poor adaptability and applicability. A promising strategy for enhancing the adaptability and realism of data-driven crowd simulation models is to incorporate visual information, including the scenario geometry and pedestrian locomotion. Consequently, this paper proposes a novel visual-information-driven (VID) crowd simulation model. The VID model predicts the pedestrian velocity at the next time step based on the prior social-visual information and motion data of an individual. A radar-geometry-locomotion method is established to extract the visual information of pedestrians. Moreover, a temporal convolutional network (TCN)-based deep learning model, named social-visual TCN, is developed for velocity prediction. The VID model is tested on three public pedestrian motion datasets with distinct geometries, i.e., corridor, corner, and T-junction. Both qualitative and quantitative metrics are employed to evaluate the VID model, and the results highlight the improved adaptability of the model across all three geometric scenarios. Overall, the proposed method demonstrates effectiveness in enhancing the adaptability of data-driven crowd models.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods are mostly in a parallel manner. While parallel fusion can benefit from long-term information, it suffers from increasing computational and memory overheads as the fusion window size grows. Alternatively, BEVFormer adopts a recurrent fusion pipeline so that history information can be efficiently integrated, yet it fails to benefit from longer temporal frames. In this paper, we explore an embarrassingly simple long-term recurrent fusion strategy built upon the LSS-based methods and find it already able to enjoy the merits from both sides, i.e., rich long-term information and efficient fusion pipeline. A temporal embedding module is further proposed to improve the model's robustness against occasionally missed frames in practical scenarios. We name this simple but effective fusing pipeline VideoBEV. Experimental results on the nuScenes benchmark show that VideoBEV obtains strong performance on various camera-based 3D perception tasks, including object detection (55.4\% mAP and 62.9\% NDS), segmentation (48.6\% vehicle mIoU), tracking (54.8\% AMOTA), and motion prediction (0.80m minADE and 0.463 EPA).</p></details> |  |

However, practical sources of uncertainty are usually coupled across time. We formally introduce temporally-coupled perturbations, presenting a novel challenge for existing robust RL methods. To tackle this challenge, we propose GRAD, a novel game-theoretic approach that treats the temporally-coupled robust RL problem as a partially observable two-player zero-sum game. By finding an approximate equilibrium within this game, GRAD optimizes for general robustness against temporally-coupled perturbations. Experiments on continuous control tasks demonstrate that, compared with prior methods, our approach achieves a higher degree of robustness to various types of attacks on different attack domains, both in settings with temporally-coupled perturbations and decoupled perturbations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2024)</p></details> |

Continuous-time MTL can define temporal constrains for physical system in natural way. Then there are several researches that deal with probability of continuous MTL semantics for stochastic processes. However, proving measurability for such events is by no means an obvious task, even though it is essential. The difficulty comes from the semantics of "until operator", which is defined by logical sum of uncountably many propositions. Given the difficulty involved in proving the measurability of such an event using classical measure-theoretic methods, we employ a theorem from stochastic analysis. This theorem is utilized to prove the measurability of hitting times for stochastic processes, and it stands as a profound result within the theory of capacity. Next, we provide an example that illustrates the failure of probability approximation when discretizing the continuous semantics of MTL formulas with respect to time. Additionally, we prove that the probability of the discretized semantics converges to that of the continuous semantics when we impose restrictions on diamond operators to prevent nesting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Final...</summary><p>Final version of publication</p></details> |

Diagnosing and Mitigating Knowledge Conflicts in Event Temporal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14970v2)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event temporal reasoning aims at identifying the temporal relations between two or more events from narratives. However, knowledge conflicts arise when there is a mismatch between the actual temporal relations of events in the context and the prior knowledge or biases learned by the model. In this paper, we propose to detect knowledge-conflict examples in event temporal reasoning using bias indicators, which include event relation prior bias, tense bias, narrative bias, and dependency bias. We define conflict examples as those where event relations are opposite to biased or prior relations. To mitigate event-related knowledge conflicts, we introduce a Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA) based method that can be applied to both Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) either as additional training data or demonstrations for In-Context Learning. Experiments suggest both PLMs and LLMs suffer from knowledge conflicts in event temporal reasoning, and CDA has the potential for reducing hallucination and improving model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of NAACL 2024</p></details> |

Specifically, we consider a generic objective function that is defined for the path of each individual agent. The primary objective is to find a global plan for the team of agents, ensuring they collectively meet the specified LTL requirements. Simultaneously, we aim to maintain a pre-determined order in the values of the objective function for each agent, which we refer to as the ordering constraints. This new requirement stems from scenarios like security-aware planning, where relative orders outweigh absolute values in importance. We present an efficient algorithm to solve this problem, supported by proofs of correctness that demonstrate the optimality of our solution. Additionally, we provide a case study in security-aware path planning to illustrate the practicality and effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article is withdrawn due to errors in the methodology section, specifically concerning the insufficient explanation of the data collection process.

Manual tuning is especially problematic if one aims to verify that the system satisfies complicated specifications described by signal temporal logic formulas since the effect the tightness of the reachable set has on the satisfaction of the specification is often non-trivial to see for humans. We address this problem with a fully-automated verifier for linear systems, which automatically refines all parameters for reachability analysis until it can either prove or disprove that the system satisfies a signal temporal logic formula for all initial states and all uncertain inputs. Our verifier combines reachset temporal logic with dependency preservation to obtain a model checking approach whose over-approximation error converges to zero for adequately tuned parameters. While we in this work focus on linear systems for simplicity, the general concept we present can equivalently be applied for nonlinear and hybrid systems.</p></details> |  |

This situation becomes more challenging when detailed operational characteristics, complicated constraints, and multiple objectives are considered. We propose a novel simplification method to determine the flexible temporal resolution for acceleration and near-optimal solutions. The flexible temporal resolution is determined by analyzing the impact on generators in each adaptive time period with awareness of congestion effects. Additionally, multiple improvements are employed on the existing NCUC model compatible with flexible temporal resolution to reduce the number of integer variables while preserving the original features. A case study using the IEEE 118-bus and the Polish 2736-bus systems verifies that the proposed method achieves substantial acceleration with low cost variation and high accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 10 figures.

By encoding a temporal consistency prior into a Gromov-Wasserstein problem, we are able to decode a temporally consistent segmentation from a noisy affinity/matching cost matrix between video frames and action classes. Unlike previous approaches, our method does not require knowing the action order for a video to attain temporal consistency. Furthermore, our resulting (fused) Gromov-Wasserstein problem can be efficiently solved on GPUs using a few iterations of projected mirror descent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in an unsupervised learning setting, where our method is used to generate pseudo-labels for self-training.

In this paper, we introduce a novel framework known as Spatial-Temporal Multi-Granularity Framework (STMGF) to enhance the capture of long-distance and long-term information of the road networks. STMGF makes full use of different granularity information of road networks and models the long-distance and long-term information by gathering information in a hierarchical interactive way. Further, it leverages the inherent periodicity in traffic sequences to refine prediction results by matching with recent traffic data. We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that STMGF outperforms all baseline models and achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

Although numerous turbulence mitigation (TM) algorithms have been proposed, their efficiency and generalization to real-world dynamic scenarios remain severely limited. Building upon the intuitions of classical TM algorithms, we present the Deep Atmospheric TUrbulence Mitigation network (DATUM). DATUM aims to overcome major challenges when transitioning from classical to deep learning approaches. By carefully integrating the merits of classical multi-frame TM methods into a deep network structure, we demonstrate that DATUM can efficiently perform long-range temporal aggregation using a recurrent fashion, while deformable attention and temporal-channel attention seamlessly facilitate pixel registration and lucky imaging. With additional supervision, tilt and blur degradation can be jointly mitigated. These inductive biases empower DATUM to significantly outperform existing methods while delivering a tenfold increase in processing speed.

Our method can compute probabilistically guaranteed high-quality temporal betweenness estimates (of nodes and temporal edges) under all the feasible temporal path optimalities, presented in the work of Bu{\ss} et al. (KDD, 2020). We provide a sample-complexity analysis of our method and speed up the temporal betweenness computation using a state-of-the-art progressive sampling approach based on Monte Carlo Empirical Rademacher Averages. Additionally, we provide an efficient sampling algorithm to approximate the temporal diameter, average path length, and other fundamental temporal graph characteristic quantities within a small error $\varepsilon$ with high probability. The running time of such approximation algorithm is $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{\log n}{\varepsilon^2}\cdot |\mathcal{E}|)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $|\mathcal{E}|$ is the number of temporal edges in the temporal graph. We support our theoretical results with an extensive experimental analysis on several real-world networks and provide empirical evidence that the MANTRA framework improves the current state of the art in speed, sample size, and required space while maintaining high accuracy of the temporal betweenness estimates.</p></details> |  |

We theoretically establish a lower bound, proving that under mild conditions, representation distortion inevitably occurs over time. To estimate the temporal distortion without human annotation after deployment, one naive approach is to pre-train a recurrent model (e.g., RNN) before deployment and use this model afterwards, but the estimation is far from satisfactory. In this paper, we analyze the representation distortion from an information theory perspective, and attribute it primarily to inaccurate feature extraction during evolution. Consequently, we introduce Smart, a straightforward and effective baseline enhanced by an adaptive feature extractor through self-supervised graph reconstruction. In synthetic random graphs, we further refine the former lower bound to show the inevitable distortion over time and empirically observe that Smart achieves good estimation performance. Moreover, we observe that Smart consistently shows outstanding generalization estimation on four real-world evolving graphs. The ablation studies underscore the necessity of graph reconstruction. For example, on OGB-arXiv dataset, the estimation metric MAPE deteriorates from 2.19% to 8.00% without reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024</p></details> |

Recent works have investigated the creation of pseudo-anomalies (PAs) using only the normal data and making strong assumptions about real-world anomalies with regards to abnormality of objects and speed of motion to inject prior information about anomalies in an autoencoder (AE) based reconstruction model during training. This work proposes a novel method for generating generic spatio-temporal PAs by inpainting a masked out region of an image using a pre-trained Latent Diffusion Model and further perturbing the optical flow using mixup to emulate spatio-temporal distortions in the data. In addition, we present a simple unified framework to detect real-world anomalies under the OCC setting by learning three types of anomaly indicators, namely reconstruction quality, temporal irregularity and semantic inconsistency.

| **[UniMD: Towards Unifying Moment Retrieval and Temporal Action Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04933v1)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Action Detection (TAD) focuses on detecting pre-defined actions, while Moment Retrieval (MR) aims to identify the events described by open-ended natural language within untrimmed videos. Despite that they focus on different events, we observe they have a significant connection. For instance, most descriptions in MR involve multiple actions from TAD. In this paper, we aim to investigate the potential synergy between TAD and MR. Firstly, we propose a unified architecture, termed Unified Moment Detection (UniMD), for both TAD and MR. It transforms the inputs of the two tasks, namely actions for TAD or events for MR, into a common embedding space, and utilizes two novel query-dependent decoders to generate a uniform output of classification score and temporal segments. Secondly, we explore the efficacy of two task fusion learning approaches, pre-training and co-training, in order to enhance the mutual benefits between TAD and MR. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed task fusion learning scheme enables the two tasks to help each other and outperform the separately trained counterparts. Impressively, UniMD achieves state-of-the-art results on three paired datasets Ego4D, Charades-STA, and ActivityNet. Our code will be released at https://github.com/yingsen1/UniMD.</p></details> | Tech report |
| **[StepNet: Spatial-temporal Part-aware Network for Isolated Sign Language Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12857v2)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of sign language recognition (SLR) is to help those who are hard of hearing or deaf overcome the communication barrier. Most existing approaches can be typically divided into two lines, i.e., Skeleton-based and RGB-based methods, but both the two lines of methods have their limitations. Skeleton-based methods do not consider facial expressions, while RGB-based approaches usually ignore the fine-grained hand structure. To overcome both limitations, we propose a new framework called Spatial-temporal Part-aware network~(StepNet), based on RGB parts. As its name suggests, it is made up of two modules: Part-level Spatial Modeling and Part-level Temporal Modeling. Part-level Spatial Modeling, in particular, automatically captures the appearance-based properties, such as hands and faces, in the feature space without the use of any keypoint-level annotations. On the other hand, Part-level Temporal Modeling implicitly mines the long-short term context to capture the relevant attributes over time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our StepNet, thanks to spatial-temporal modules, achieves competitive Top-1 Per-instance accuracy on three commonly-used SLR benchmarks, i.e., 56.89% on WLASL, 77.2% on NMFs-CSL, and 77.1% on BOBSL. Additionally, the proposed method is compatible with the optical flow input and can produce superior performance if fused. For those who are hard of hearing, we hope that our work can act as a preliminary step.</p></details> |  |

Our method partitions the input video into temporally consecutive segments with clustering information, enabling the injection of temporal awareness into the clustering process, setting it apart from prior cluster-based summarization methods. The resulting temporal-aware clusters are then utilized to compute the final summary, using simple rules for keyframe selection and frame importance scoring. Experimental results on the SumMe dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, outperforming existing unsupervised methods and achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art supervised summarization techniques.

| **[Longitudinal Targeted Minimum Loss-based Estimation with Temporal-Difference Heterogeneous Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04399v1)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Deep Longitudinal Targeted Minimum Loss-based Estimation (Deep LTMLE), a novel approach to estimate the counterfactual mean of outcome under dynamic treatment policies in longitudinal problem settings. Our approach utilizes a transformer architecture with heterogeneous type embedding trained using temporal-difference learning. After obtaining an initial estimate using the transformer, following the targeted minimum loss-based likelihood estimation (TMLE) framework, we statistically corrected for the bias commonly associated with machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, our method also facilitates statistical inference by enabling the provision of 95% confidence intervals grounded in asymptotic statistical theory. Simulation results demonstrate our method's superior performance over existing approaches, particularly in complex, long time-horizon scenarios. It remains effective in small-sample, short-duration contexts, matching the performance of asymptotically efficient estimators. To demonstrate our method in practice, we applied our method to estimate counterfactual mean outcomes for standard versus intensive blood pressure management strategies in a real-world cardiovascular epidemiology cohort study.</p></details> |  |

Towards both ends, we introduce the temporal counting logic $\textbf{K}_\text{t}$[#] alongside the RASP variant $\textbf{C-RASP}$. We show they are equivalent to each other, and that together they are the best-known lower bound on the formal expressivity of future-masked soft attention transformers with unbounded input size. We prove this by showing all $\textbf{K}_\text{t}$[#] formulas can be compiled into these transformers. As a case study, we demonstrate on paper how to use $\textbf{C-RASP}$ to construct simple transformer language models that, using greedy decoding, can only generate sentences that have given properties formally specified in $\textbf{K}_\text{t}$[#].</p></details> |  |

Conventional risk-aware control typically assumes that all specifications are predefined and remain unchanged during runtime. In this paper, we propose a novel, provably correct model predictive control scheme for linear systems with additive unbounded stochastic disturbances that dynamically evaluates the feasibility of runtime signal temporal logic specifications and automatically reschedules the control inputs accordingly. The control method guarantees the probabilistic satisfaction of newly accepted specifications without sacrificing the satisfaction of the previously accepted ones. The proposed control method is validated by a robotic motion planning case study.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, Accepted for ADHS 2024</p></details> |

These scenarios, despite realistic, are often neglected in the literature, exposing these solutions to important performance degradation. In this work, we tackle this issue by introducing, for the first time, an approach for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) in sparse TAL, which we refer to as Semantic Adversarial unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SADA). Our contributions are threefold: (1) we pioneer the development of a domain adaptation model that operates on realistic sparse action detection benchmarks; (2) we tackle the limitations of global-distribution alignment techniques by introducing a novel adversarial loss that is sensitive to local class distributions, ensuring finer-grained adaptation; and (3) we present a novel set of benchmarks based on EpicKitchens100 and CharadesEgo, that evaluate multiple domain shifts in a comprehensive manner. Our experiments indicate that SADA improves the adaptation across domains when compared to fully supervised state-of-the-art and alternative UDA methods, attaining a performance boost of up to 6.14% mAP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural-Symbolic VideoQA: Learning Compositional Spatio-Temporal Reasoning for Real-world Video Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04007v1)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compositional spatio-temporal reasoning poses a significant challenge in the field of video question answering (VideoQA). Existing approaches struggle to establish effective symbolic reasoning structures, which are crucial for answering compositional spatio-temporal questions. To address this challenge, we propose a neural-symbolic framework called Neural-Symbolic VideoQA (NS-VideoQA), specifically designed for real-world VideoQA tasks. The uniqueness and superiority of NS-VideoQA are two-fold: 1) It proposes a Scene Parser Network (SPN) to transform static-dynamic video scenes into Symbolic Representation (SR), structuralizing persons, objects, relations, and action chronologies. 2) A Symbolic Reasoning Machine (SRM) is designed for top-down question decompositions and bottom-up compositional reasonings. Specifically, a polymorphic program executor is constructed for internally consistent reasoning from SR to the final answer. As a result, Our NS-VideoQA not only improves the compositional spatio-temporal reasoning in real-world VideoQA task, but also enables step-by-step error analysis by tracing the intermediate results. Experimental evaluations on the AGQA Decomp benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NS-VideoQA framework. Empirical studies further confirm that NS-VideoQA exhibits internal consistency in answering compositional questions and significantly improves the capability of spatio-temporal and logical inference for VideoQA tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling social interaction dynamics using temporal graph networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06611v1)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating intelligent systems, such as robots, into dynamic group settings poses challenges due to the mutual influence of human behaviors and internal states. A robust representation of social interaction dynamics is essential for effective human-robot collaboration. Existing approaches often narrow their focus to facial expressions or speech, overlooking the broader context. We propose employing an adapted Temporal Graph Networks to comprehensively represent social interaction dynamics while enabling its practical implementation. Our method incorporates temporal multi-modal behavioral data including gaze interaction, voice activity and environmental context. This representation of social interaction dynamics is trained as a link prediction problem using annotated gaze interaction data. The F1-score outperformed the baseline model by 37.0%. This improvement is consistent for a secondary task of next speaker prediction which achieves an improvement of 29.0%. Our contributions are two-fold, including a model to representing social interaction dynamics which can be used for many downstream human-robot interaction tasks like human state inference and next speaker prediction. More importantly, this is achieved using a more concise yet efficient message passing method, significantly reducing it from 768 to 14 elements, while outperforming the baseline model.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

However, unravelling the underlying reasoning of LLMs and explaining their internal mechanisms of exploiting this factual knowledge remain active areas of investigation. Our work analyzes the factual knowledge encoded in the latent representation of LLMs when prompted to assess the truthfulness of factual claims. We propose an end-to-end framework that jointly decodes the factual knowledge embedded in the latent space of LLMs from a vector space to a set of ground predicates and represents its evolution across the layers using a temporal knowledge graph. Our framework relies on the technique of activation patching which intervenes in the inference computation of a model by dynamically altering its latent representations. Consequently, we neither rely on external models nor training processes. We showcase our framework with local and global interpretability analyses using two claim verification datasets: FEVER and CLIMATE-FEVER. The local interpretability analysis exposes different latent errors from representation to multi-hop reasoning errors. On the other hand, the global analysis uncovered patterns in the underlying evolution of the model's factual knowledge (e.g., store-and-seek factual information). By enabling graph-based analyses of the latent representations, this work represents a step towards the mechanistic interpretability of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

The evolution of 3D semantic occupancy prediction as a pretraining task for autonomous driving and robotic downstream tasks capture finer 3D details compared to methods like 3D detection. Existing approaches predominantly focus on spatial cues such as tri-perspective view embeddings (TPV), often overlooking temporal cues. This study introduces a spatiotemporal transformer architecture S2TPVFormer for temporally coherent 3D semantic occupancy prediction. We enrich the prior process by including temporal cues using a novel temporal cross-view hybrid attention mechanism (TCVHA) and generate spatiotemporal TPV embeddings (i.e. S2TPV embeddings). Experimental evaluations on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate a substantial 4.1% improvement in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) for 3D Semantic Occupancy compared to TPVFormer, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed S2TPVFormer in enhancing 3D scene perception.</p></details> |  |

On the other hand, search for multivariate copulas with desirable dependence properties also is an important area of research. When fitting regression models to non-Gaussian longitudinal data, multivariate Gaussian copula is commonly used to account for temporal dependence of the repeated measurements. But using symmetric multivariate Gaussian copula is not preferable in every situation, since it can not capture non-exchangeable dependence or tail dependence, if present in the data. Hence to ensure reliable inference, it is important to look beyond the Gaussian dependence assumption. In this paper, we construct geometric skew-normal copula from multivariate geometric skew-normal (MGSN) distribution proposed by Kundu (2014) and Kundu (2017) in order to model temporal dependency of non-Gaussian longitudinal data. First we investigate the theoretical properties of the proposed multivariate copula, and then develop regression models for both continuous and discrete longitudinal data. The quantile function of this copula is independent of the correlation matrix of its respective multivariate distribution, which provides computational advantage in terms of likelihood inference compared to the class of copulas derived from skew-elliptical distributions by Azzalini & Valle (1996). Moreover, composite likelihood inference is possible for this multivariate copula, which facilitates to estimate parameters from ordered probit model with same dependence structure as geometric skew-normal distribution. We conduct extensive simulation studies to validate our proposed models and therefore apply them to analyze the longitudinal dependence of two real world data sets. Finally, we report our findings in terms of improvements over multivariate Gaussian copula based regression models.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 2 figures and 5 tables</p></details> |

In this work, we develop a direct data-driven control synthesis method for temporal logic specifications, which does not require this explicit modeling step, capable of providing certificates for the general class of linear systems. After collecting a single sequence of input-output data from the system, we construct a data-driven characterization of the behavior. Using this characterization, we synthesize a controller, such that the controlled system satisfies a (possibly unbounded) temporal logic specification. The underlying optimization problem is solved by mixed-integer linear programming. We demonstrate the applicability of the results through simulation examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the 8th IFAC conference on Analysis and Design of Hybrid Systems</p></details> |

In particular, we formally verify the LTL formula by constructing temporal logic trees (TLT)s via backward reachability analysis (BRA). In previous works, TLTs are predominantly constructed with either highly general and computationally intensive level set-based BRA or simplistic and computationally efficient polytope-based BRA. In this work, we instead propose the construction of TLTs using hybrid zonotope-based BRA. By using hybrid zonotopes, we show that we are able to formally verify LTL specifications in a computationally efficient manner while still being able to represent complex geometries that are often present when deploying autonomous systems, such as non-convex, disjoint sets. Moreover, we evaluate our approach on a parking example, providing preliminary indications of how hybrid zonotopes facilitate computationally efficient formal verification of LTL specifications in environments that naturally lead to non-convex, disjoint geometries.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, 1 algorithm</p></details> |

We deploy CMT to detect crowdsourcing frauds on an industry-size HTG of a representative MMMA WeChat and it significantly outperforms other methods.

Despite significant advancements towards an end-to-end framework in object detection, query-based detectors have been limited in achieving full end-to-end modeling in TAD. To address this issue, we propose \modelname{}, a full end-to-end temporal action detection transformer that integrates time-aligned coordinate expression. We reformulate coordinate expression utilizing actual timeline values, ensuring length-invariant representations from the extremely diverse video duration environment. Furthermore, our proposed adaptive query selection dynamically adjusts the number of queries based on video length, providing a suitable solution for varying video durations compared to a fixed query set. Our approach not only simplifies the TAD process by eliminating the need for hand-crafted components but also significantly improves the performance of query-based detectors. Our TE-TAD outperforms the previous query-based detectors and achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on popular benchmark datasets.

While contrastive learning approach is promising in addressing spatio-temporal heterogeneity, the existing methods are noneffective in determining negative pairs and can hardly apply to PFL paradigm. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel PFL method, named Federated dUal sEmantic aLignment-based contraStive learning (FUELS), which can adaptively align positive and negative pairs based on semantic similarity, thereby injecting precise spatio-temporal heterogeneity into the latent representation space by auxiliary contrastive tasks. From temporal perspective, a hard negative filtering module is introduced to dynamically align heterogeneous temporal representations for the supplemented intra-client contrastive task. From spatial perspective, we design lightweight-but-efficient prototypes as client-level semantic representations, based on which the server evaluates spatial similarity and yields client-customized global prototypes for the supplemented inter-client contrastive task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FUELS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with communication cost decreasing by around 94%.</p></details> |  |

Despite the promising results achieved by recent research leveraging recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs), these approaches often fail to adequately consider the impact of the edge temporal states on the strength of inter-node relationships across different time slices, further overlooking the dynamic changes in node features induced by fluctuations in relationship strength. Furthermore, the extraction of global structural features is hindered by the inherent over-smoothing drawback of GNNs, which in turn limits their overall performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel dynamic graph representation learning framework namely Recurrent Structure-reinforced Graph Transformer (RSGT), which initially models the temporal status of edges explicitly by utilizing different edge types and weights based on the differences between any two consecutive snapshots. In this manner, the varying edge temporal states are mapped as a part of the topological structure of the graph. Subsequently, a structure-reinforced graph transformer is proposed to capture temporal node representations that encoding both the graph topological structure and evolving dynamics,through a recurrent learning paradigm. Our experimental evaluations, conducted on four real-world datasets, underscore the superior performance of the RSGT in the realm of discrete dynamic graph representation learning. The results reveal that RSGT consistently surpasses competing methods in dynamic link prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

We utilize spatial self-attention module with adaptive topology to understand intra-frame interactions within a frame among different body parts, and temporal self-attention module to examine correlations between frames of a node. These two are followed by multi-scale convolution network with dilations, which not only captures the long-range temporal dependencies of joints but also the long-range spatial dependencies (i.e., long-distance dependencies) of node temporal behaviors. They are combined into high-level spatial-temporal representations and output the predicted action with the softmax classifier.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

Our key contribution is the development of user-level differentially private algorithms that incorporate carefully chosen parameter values to ensure low estimation errors on real-world datasets, while ensuring privacy. We test our algorithms on ITMS (Intelligent Traffic Management System) data from an Indian city, where the speeds of different buses are drawn in a potentially non-i.i.d. manner from an unknown distribution, and where the number of speed samples contributed by different buses is potentially different. We then apply our algorithms to large synthetic datasets, generated based on the ITMS data. Here, we provide theoretical justification for the observed performance trends, and also provide recommendations for the choices of algorithm subroutines that result in low estimation errors. Finally, we characterize the best performance of pseudo-user creation-based algorithms on worst-case datasets via a minimax approach; this then gives rise to a novel procedure for the creation of pseudo-users, which optimizes the worst-case total estimation error. The algorithms discussed in the paper are readily applicable to general spatio-temporal IoT datasets for releasing a differentially private mean of a desired value.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, to be submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Most formulations of temporal complex event are unstructured or without extensive temporal information, resulting in inferior representations and limited forecasting capabilities. To bridge these gaps, we innovatively introduce the formulation of Structured, Complex, and Time-complete temporal event (SCTc-TE). Following this comprehensive formulation, we develop a fully automated pipeline and construct a large-scale dataset named MidEast-TE from about 0.6 million news articles. This dataset focuses on the cooperation and conflict events among countries mainly in the MidEast region from 2015 to 2022. Not limited to the dataset construction, more importantly, we advance the forecasting methods by discriminating the crucial roles of various contextual information, i.e., local and global contexts. Thereby, we propose a novel method LoGo that is able to take advantage of both Local and Global contexts for SCTc-TE forecasting. We evaluate our proposed approach on both our proposed MidEast-TE dataset and the original GDELT-TE dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our forecasting model LoGo.

While bearing sensors are typically placed on the bearing housing, direct load monitoring requires sensors inside the bearing itself. Recently introduced sensor rollers enable direct bearing load monitoring but are constrained by their battery life. Data-driven virtual sensors can learn from sensor roller data collected during a batterys lifetime to map operating conditions to bearing loads. Although spatially distributed bearing sensors offer insights into load distribution (e.g., correlating temperature with load), traditional machine learning algorithms struggle to fully exploit these spatial-temporal dependencies. To address this gap, we introduce a graph-based virtual sensor that leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to analyze spatial-temporal dependencies among sensor signals, mapping existing measurements (temperature, vibration) to bearing loads. Since temperature and vibration signals exhibit vastly different dynamics, we propose Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural Networks (HTGNN), which explicitly models these signal types and their interactions for effective load prediction. Our results demonstrate that HTGNN outperforms Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which struggle to capture both spatial and heterogeneous signal characteristics. These findings highlight the importance of capturing the complex spatial interactions between temperature, vibration, and load.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

However, networks encode only pairwise interactions, while most social interactions occur among groups of individuals, requiring higher-order network representations. Despite the recent interest in higher-order networks, little is known about the mechanisms that govern the formation and evolution of groups, and how people move between groups. Here, we leverage empirical data on social interactions among children and university students to study their temporal dynamics at both individual and group levels, characterising how individuals navigate groups and how groups form and disaggregate. We find robust patterns across contexts and propose a dynamical model that closely reproduces empirical observations. These results represent a further step in understanding social systems, and open up research directions to study the impact of group dynamics on dynamical processes that evolve on top of them.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, Supplementary Material (15 pages, 25 figures)</p></details> |

The main motivation for the model is to integrate the temporal dimension into the analysis of players' passing networks in order to gain deeper insights into the dynamics of system behavior, particularly how a system exploits the degeneracy property to self-regulate. First, the temporal graph model and the entropy measures used to assess the complexity of the dynamics of the network structure are introduced and illustrated. Second, an experiment using basketball data is conducted to investigate the relationship between the complexity level and team performance. This is accomplished by examining the correlations between the entropy measures in a team's behavior and the team's final performance, as well as the link between the relative score compared to that of the opponent and the entropy in the team's behavior. Results indicate positive correlations between entropy measures and final team performance, and threshold values of relative score associated with changes in team behavior -- thereby revealing common and unique team signatures. From a complexity science perspective, the model proves useful for identifying key performance factors in team sports and for studying the effects of given constraints on the exploitation of degeneracy to organize team behavior through various network structures. Future research can easily extend the model and apply it to other types of social networks.</p></details> |  |

The core challenge of this task lies in understanding the complex semantic information regarding multiple types of time constraints (e.g., before, first) in questions. Existing end-to-end methods implicitly model the time constraints by learning time-aware embeddings of questions and candidate answers, which is far from understanding the question comprehensively. Motivated by semantic-parsing-based approaches that explicitly model constraints in questions by generating logical forms with symbolic operators, we design fundamental temporal operators for time constraints and introduce a novel self-improvement Programming method for TKGQA (Prog-TQA). Specifically, Prog-TQA leverages the in-context learning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand the combinatory time constraints in the questions and generate corresponding program drafts with a few examples given. Then, it aligns these drafts to TKGs with the linking module and subsequently executes them to generate the answers. To enhance the ability to understand questions, Prog-TQA is further equipped with a self-improvement strategy to effectively bootstrap LLMs using high-quality self-generated drafts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed Prog-TQA on MultiTQ and CronQuestions datasets, especially in the Hits@1 metric.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by LREC-COLING 2024 (long paper)</p></details> |
| **[Distributional Drift Adaptation with Temporal Conditional Variational Autoencoder for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00654v4)** | 2024-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the non-stationary nature, the distribution of real-world multivariate time series (MTS) changes over time, which is known as distribution drift. Most existing MTS forecasting models greatly suffer from distribution drift and degrade the forecasting performance over time. Existing methods address distribution drift via adapting to the latest arrived data or self-correcting per the meta knowledge derived from future data. Despite their great success in MTS forecasting, these methods hardly capture the intrinsic distribution changes, especially from a distributional perspective. Accordingly, we propose a novel framework temporal conditional variational autoencoder (TCVAE) to model the dynamic distributional dependencies over time between historical observations and future data in MTSs and infer the dependencies as a temporal conditional distribution to leverage latent variables. Specifically, a novel temporal Hawkes attention mechanism represents temporal factors subsequently fed into feed-forward networks to estimate the prior Gaussian distribution of latent variables. The representation of temporal factors further dynamically adjusts the structures of Transformer-based encoder and decoder to distribution changes by leveraging a gated attention mechanism. Moreover, we introduce conditional continuous normalization flow to transform the prior Gaussian to a complex and form-free distribution to facilitate flexible inference of the temporal conditional distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on six real-world MTS datasets demonstrate the TCVAE's superior robustness and effectiveness over the state-of-the-art MTS forecasting baselines. We further illustrate the TCVAE applicability through multifaceted case studies and visualization in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, accepted by IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)</p></details> |
| **[Selective Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01695v1)** | 2024-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG), which characterizes temporally evolving facts in the form of (subject, relation, object, timestamp), has attracted much attention recently. TKG reasoning aims to predict future facts based on given historical ones. However, existing TKG reasoning models are unable to abstain from predictions they are uncertain, which will inevitably bring risks in real-world applications. Thus, in this paper, we propose an abstention mechanism for TKG reasoning, which helps the existing models make selective, instead of indiscriminate, predictions. Specifically, we develop a confidence estimator, called Confidence Estimator with History (CEHis), to enable the existing TKG reasoning models to first estimate their confidence in making predictions, and then abstain from those with low confidence. To do so, CEHis takes two kinds of information into consideration, namely, the certainty of the current prediction and the accuracy of historical predictions. Experiments with representative TKG reasoning models on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CEHis.</p></details> |  |

Recent work has focused on spatially aligning BEV-based features over timesteps. However, this is often limited as its gain does not scale well with long-term past observations. To address this, we advocate for supervising a model to predict objects' poses given past observations, thus explicitly guiding to learn objects' temporal cues. To this end, we propose a model called DAP (Detection After Prediction), consisting of a two-branch network: (i) a branch responsible for forecasting the current objects' poses given past observations and (ii) another branch that detects objects based on the current and past observations. The features predicting the current objects from branch (i) is fused into branch (ii) to transfer predictive knowledge. We conduct extensive experiments with the large-scale nuScenes datasets, and we observe that utilizing such predictive information significantly improves the overall detection performance. Our model can be used plug-and-play, showing consistent performance gain.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies, which employ pre-trained language models to auto-regressively generate linearised graphs for constructing event temporal graphs, have shown promising results. However, these methods have often led to suboptimal graph generation as the linearised graphs exhibit set characteristics which are instead treated sequentially by language models. This discrepancy stems from the conventional text generation objectives, leading to erroneous penalisation of correct predictions caused by the misalignment of elements in target sequences. To address these challenges, we reframe the task as a conditional set generation problem, proposing a Set-aligning Framework tailored for the effective utilisation of Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework incorporates data augmentations and set-property regularisations designed to alleviate text generation loss penalties associated with the linearised graph edge sequences, thus encouraging the generation of more relation edges. Experimental results show that our framework surpasses existing baselines for event temporal graph generation. Furthermore, under zero-shot settings, the structural knowledge introduced through our framework notably improves model generalisation, particularly when the training examples available are limited.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2024. 9 + 10 pages</p></details> |

Regardless of the recipient, the message space and time scale could be too fast, too slow, too large, or too small and may never be decoded. Therefore, it pays to devise a way to encode messages agnostic of space and time scales. We propose the use of fractal functions as self-executable infinite-frequency carriers for sending messages, given their properties of structural self-similarity and scale invariance. We call it `fractal messaging'. Starting from a spatial embedding, we introduce a framework for a space-time scale-free messaging approach to this challenge. When considering a space and time-agnostic framework for message transmission, it would be interesting to encode a message such that it could be decoded at several spatio-temporal scales. Hence, the core idea of the framework proposed herein is to encode a binary message as waves along infinitely many frequencies (in power-like distributions) and amplitudes, transmit such a message, and then decode and reproduce it. To do so, the components of the Weierstrass function, a known fractal, are used as carriers of the message. Each component will have its amplitude modulated to embed the binary stream, allowing for a space-time-agnostic approach to messaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages + appendix (21 pages total)</p></details> |

However, learning useful representations of EHR data is challenging due to its high dimensionality, sparsity, multimodality, irregular and variable-specific recording frequency, and timestamp duplication when multiple measurements are recorded simultaneously. Although recent efforts to fuse structured EHR and unstructured clinical notes suggest the potential for more accurate prediction of clinical outcomes, less focus has been placed on EHR embedding approaches that directly address temporal EHR challenges by learning time-aware representations from multimodal patient time series. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic embedding and tokenization framework for precise representation of multimodal clinical time series that combines novel methods for encoding time and sequential position with temporal cross-attention. Our embedding and tokenization framework, when integrated into a multitask transformer classifier with sliding window attention, outperformed baseline approaches on the exemplar task of predicting the occurrence of nine postoperative complications of more than 120,000 major inpatient surgeries using multimodal data from three hospitals and two academic health centers in the United States.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2024 Workshop on Learning From Time Series for Health. 10 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |

In the past, All-Wheel-Steering(AWS) robots, incorporating modes such as rotation-free translation maneuvers, in-situ rotational maneuvers, and proportional steering, exhibited inefficient performance due to time-consuming mode switches. This inefficiency arises from wheel rotation constraints and inter-wheel cooperation requirements. The direct application of a holonomic moving strategy can lead to significant slip angles or even structural failure. Additionally, the limited steering range of AWS wheeled robots exacerbates nonlinearity issues, thereby complicating control processes. To address these challenges, we developed a novel planning method termed Constrained AWS(C-AWS), which integrates second-order discrete search with predictive control techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that our method adeptly generates feasible and smooth trajectories for C-AWS while adhering to steering angle constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>iros ...</summary><p>iros 2024 under review</p></details> |

Model predictive path integral control is a framework that builds upon optimization principles while incorporating stochastic sampling of input trajectories. This paper investigates several sampling approaches for trajectory generation. In this context, normalizing flows originating from the field of variational inference are considered for the generation of sampling distributions, as they model transformations of simple to more complex distributions. Accordingly, learning-based normalizing flow models are trained for a more efficient exploration of the input domain for the task at hand.

| **[Learning Planning-based Reasoning by Trajectories Collection and Process Reward Synthesizing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00658v2)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in handling complex reasoning tasks through step-by-step rationale generation. However, recent studies have raised concerns regarding the hallucination and flaws in their reasoning process. Substantial efforts are being made to improve the reliability and faithfulness of the generated rationales. Some approaches model reasoning as planning, while others focus on annotating for process supervision. Nevertheless, the planning-based search process often results in high latency due to the frequent assessment of intermediate reasoning states and the extensive exploration space. Additionally, supervising the reasoning process with human annotation is costly and challenging to scale for LLM training. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a framework to learn planning-based reasoning through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on collected trajectories, which are ranked according to synthesized process rewards. Our results on challenging logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our learning framework, showing that our 7B model can surpass the strong counterparts like GPT-3.5-Turbo.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

Learning-based methods are currently showing impressive results in simulation-based challenges, with transformer-based architectures technologically leading the way. Ultimately, however, predictions are needed in the real world. In addition to the shifts from simulation to the real world, many vehicle- and country-specific shifts, i.e. differences in sensor systems, fusion and perception algorithms as well as traffic rules and laws, are on the agenda. Since models that can cover all system setups and design domains at once are not yet foreseeable, model adaptation plays a central role. Therefore, a simulation-based study on transfer learning techniques is conducted on basis of a transformer-based model. Furthermore, the study aims to provide insights into possible trade-offs between computational time and performance to support effective transfers into the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published as part of the 2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), Jeju Shinhwa World, Jeju Island, Korea, June 2-5, 2024</p></details> |

In particular, real trajectories in the wildlife domain are scarce as a result of ethical and environmental constraints of the collection process. In this paper, we consider the problem of generating long-horizon trajectories, akin to wildlife migration, based on a small set of real samples. We propose a hierarchical approach to learn the global movement characteristics of the real dataset and recursively refine localized regions. Our solution, WildGraph, discretizes the geographic path into a prototype network of H3 (https://www.uber.com/blog/h3/) regions and leverages a recurrent variational auto-encoder to probabilistically generate paths over the regions, based on occupancy. WildGraph successfully generates realistic months-long trajectories using a sample size as small as 60. Experiments performed on two wildlife migration datasets demonstrate that our proposed method improves the generalization of the generated trajectories in comparison to existing work while achieving superior or comparable performance in several benchmark metrics. Our code is published on the following repository: \url{https://github.com/aliwister/wildgraph}.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Performance of Jerk-Constrained Time-Optimal Trajectory Planning for Industrial Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07889v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jerk-constrained trajectories offer a wide range of advantages that collectively improve the performance of robotic systems, including increased energy efficiency, durability, and safety. In this paper, we present a novel approach to jerk-constrained time-optimal trajectory planning (TOTP), which follows a specified path while satisfying up to third-order constraints to ensure safety and smooth motion. One significant challenge in jerk-constrained TOTP is a non-convex formulation arising from the inclusion of third-order constraints. Approximating inequality constraints can be particularly challenging because the resulting solutions may violate the actual constraints. We address this problem by leveraging convexity within the proposed formulation to form conservative inequality constraints. We then obtain the desired trajectories by solving an $\boldsymbol n$-dimensional Sequential Linear Program (SLP) iteratively until convergence. Lastly, we evaluate in a real robot the performance of trajectories generated with and without jerk limits in terms of peak power, torque efficiency, and tracking capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bi-level Trajectory Optimization on Uneven Terrains with Differentiable Wheel-Terrain Interaction Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03307v2)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigation of wheeled vehicles on uneven terrain necessitates going beyond the 2D approaches for trajectory planning. Specifically, it is essential to incorporate the full 6dof variation of vehicle pose and its associated stability cost in the planning process. To this end, most recent works aim to learn a neural network model to predict the vehicle evolution. However, such approaches are data-intensive and fraught with generalization issues. In this paper, we present a purely model-based approach that just requires the digital elevation information of the terrain. Specifically, we express the wheel-terrain interaction and 6dof pose prediction as a non-linear least squares (NLS) problem. As a result, trajectory planning can be viewed as a bi-level optimization. The inner optimization layer predicts the pose on the terrain along a given trajectory, while the outer layer deforms the trajectory itself to reduce the stability and kinematic costs of the pose. We improve the state-of-the-art in the following respects. First, we show that our NLS based pose prediction closely matches the output from a high-fidelity physics engine. This result coupled with the fact that we can query gradients of the NLS solver, makes our pose predictor, a differentiable wheel-terrain interaction model. We further leverage this differentiability to efficiently solve the proposed bi-level trajectory optimization problem. Finally, we perform extensive experiments, and comparison with a baseline to showcase the effectiveness of our approach in obtaining smooth, stable trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024)</p></details> |

| **[VeTraSS: Vehicle Trajectory Similarity Search Through Graph Modeling and Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08021v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory similarity search plays an essential role in autonomous driving, as it enables vehicles to analyze the information and characteristics of different trajectories to make informed decisions and navigate safely in dynamic environments. Existing work on the trajectory similarity search task primarily utilizes sequence-processing algorithms or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which suffer from the inevitable issues of complicated architecture and heavy training costs. Considering the intricate connections between trajectories, using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for data modeling is feasible. However, most methods directly use existing mathematical graph structures as the input instead of constructing specific graphs from certain vehicle trajectory data. This ignores such data's unique and dynamic characteristics. To bridge such a research gap, we propose VeTraSS -- an end-to-end pipeline for Vehicle Trajectory Similarity Search. Specifically, VeTraSS models the original trajectory data into multi-scale graphs, and generates comprehensive embeddings through a novel multi-layer attention-based GNN. The learned embeddings can be used for searching similar vehicle trajectories. Extensive experiments on the Porto and Geolife datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VeTraSS, where our model outperforms existing work and reaches the state-of-the-art. This demonstrates the potential of VeTraSS for trajectory analysis and safe navigation in self-driving vehicles in the real world.</p></details> |  |
| **[HPNet: Dynamic Trajectory Forecasting with Historical Prediction Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06351v2)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the trajectories of road agents is essential for autonomous driving systems. The recent mainstream methods follow a static paradigm, which predicts the future trajectory by using a fixed duration of historical frames. These methods make the predictions independently even at adjacent time steps, which leads to potential instability and temporal inconsistency. As successive time steps have largely overlapping historical frames, their forecasting should have intrinsic correlation, such as overlapping predicted trajectories should be consistent, or be different but share the same motion goal depending on the road situation. Motivated by this, in this work, we introduce HPNet, a novel dynamic trajectory forecasting method. Aiming for stable and accurate trajectory forecasting, our method leverages not only historical frames including maps and agent states, but also historical predictions. Specifically, we newly design a Historical Prediction Attention module to automatically encode the dynamic relationship between successive predictions. Besides, it also extends the attention range beyond the currently visible window benefitting from the use of historical predictions. The proposed Historical Prediction Attention together with the Agent Attention and Mode Attention is further formulated as the Triple Factorized Attention module, serving as the core design of HPNet.Experiments on the Argoverse and INTERACTION datasets show that HPNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, and generates accurate and stable future trajectories.

However, existing representations for motion, such as deformation models or time-dependent neural representations, are limited in the amount of motion they can generate-they cannot synthesize motion extending far beyond the bounding box used for volume rendering. The lack of a more flexible motion model contributes to the gap in realism between 4D generation methods and recent, near-photorealistic video generation models. Here, we propose TC4D: trajectory-conditioned text-to-4D generation, which factors motion into global and local components. We represent the global motion of a scene's bounding box using rigid transformation along a trajectory parameterized by a spline. We learn local deformations that conform to the global trajectory using supervision from a text-to-video model. Our approach enables the synthesis of scenes animated along arbitrary trajectories, compositional scene generation, and significant improvements to the realism and amount of generated motion, which we evaluate qualitatively and through a user study.

Here we test a diffusion probabilistic model on a specific dataset of corrupted images corresponding to incomplete Euclidean distance matrices of fBm at various memory exponents $H$. Our dataset implies uniqueness of the data imputation in the regime of low missing ratio, where the remaining partial graph is rigid, providing the ground truth for the inpainting. We find that the conditional diffusion generation stably reproduces the statistics of missing fBm-distributed distances for different values of $H$ exponent. Furthermore, while diffusion models have been recently shown to remember samples from the training database, we show that diffusion-based inpainting behaves qualitatively different from the database search with the increasing database size. Finally, we apply our fBm-trained diffusion model with $H=1/3$ for completion of chromosome distance matrices obtained in single-cell microscopy experiments, showing its superiority over the standard bioinformatics algorithms.

| **[Trajectory-Oriented Policy Optimization with Sparse Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02225v3)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mastering deep reinforcement learning (DRL) proves challenging in tasks featuring scant rewards. These limited rewards merely signify whether the task is partially or entirely accomplished, necessitating various exploration actions before the agent garners meaningful feedback. Consequently, the majority of existing DRL exploration algorithms struggle to acquire practical policies within a reasonable timeframe. To address this challenge, we introduce an approach leveraging offline demonstration trajectories for swifter and more efficient online RL in environments with sparse rewards. Our pivotal insight involves treating offline demonstration trajectories as guidance, rather than mere imitation, allowing our method to learn a policy whose distribution of state-action visitation marginally matches that of offline demonstrations. We specifically introduce a novel trajectory distance relying on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) and cast policy optimization as a distance-constrained optimization problem. We then illustrate that this optimization problem can be streamlined into a policy-gradient algorithm, integrating rewards shaped by insights from offline demonstrations. The proposed algorithm undergoes evaluation across extensive discrete and continuous control tasks with sparse and misleading rewards. The experimental findings demonstrate the significant superiority of our proposed algorithm over baseline methods concerning diverse exploration and the acquisition of an optimal policy.</p></details> | 6 pages, 7 figures |
| **[TrajPRed: Trajectory Prediction with Region-based Relation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06971v1)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting human trajectories in traffic scenes is critical for safety within mixed or fully autonomous systems. Human future trajectories are driven by two major stimuli, social interactions, and stochastic goals. Thus, reliable forecasting needs to capture these two stimuli. Edge-based relation modeling represents social interactions using pairwise correlations from precise individual states. Nevertheless, edge-based relations can be vulnerable under perturbations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a region-based relation learning paradigm that models social interactions via region-wise dynamics of joint states, i.e., the changes in the density of crowds. In particular, region-wise agent joint information is encoded within convolutional feature grids. Social relations are modeled by relating the temporal changes of local joint information from a global perspective. We show that region-based relations are less susceptible to perturbations. In order to account for the stochastic individual goals, we exploit a conditional variational autoencoder to realize multi-goal estimation and diverse future prediction. Specifically, we perform variational inference via the latent distribution, which is conditioned on the correlation between input states and associated target goals. Sampling from the latent distribution enables the framework to reliably capture the stochastic behavior in test data. We integrate multi-goal estimation and region-based relation learning to model the two stimuli, social interactions, and stochastic goals, in a prediction framework. We evaluate our framework on the ETH-UCY dataset and Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD). We show that the diverse prediction better fits the ground truth when incorporating the relation module. Our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art models on SDD by $27.61\%$/$18.20\%$ of ADE/FDE metrics.</p></details> |  |

To capture complex spatial-temporal dynamics and social interactions, recent studies developed models based on advanced deep-learning methods. On the other hand, recent studies have explored the use of deep generative models to further account for trajectory uncertainties. However, the current approaches demonstrating indeterminacy involve inefficient and time-consuming practices such as sampling from trained models. To fill this gap, we proposed a novel model named Graph Recurrent Attentive Neural Process (GRANP) for vehicle trajectory prediction while efficiently quantifying prediction uncertainty. In particular, GRANP contains an encoder with deterministic and latent paths, and a decoder for prediction. The encoder, including stacked Graph Attention Networks, LSTM and 1D convolutional layers, is employed to extract spatial-temporal relationships. The decoder is used to learn a latent distribution and thus quantify prediction uncertainty. To reveal the effectiveness of our model, we evaluate the performance of GRANP on the highD dataset. Extensive experiments show that GRANP achieves state-of-the-art results and can efficiently quantify uncertainties. Additionally, we undertake an intuitive case study that showcases the interpretability of the proposed approach. The code is available at https://github.com/joy-driven/GRANP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deadlock Resolution and Recursive Feasibility in MPC-based Multi-robot Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06071v4)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online collision-free trajectory generation within a shared workspace is fundamental for most multi-robot applications. However, many widely-used methods based on model predictive control (MPC) lack theoretical guarantees on the feasibility of underlying optimization. Furthermore, when applied in a distributed manner without a central coordinator, deadlocks often occur where several robots block each other indefinitely. Whereas heuristic methods such as introducing random perturbations exist, no profound analyses are given to validate these measures. Towards this end, we propose a systematic method called infinite-horizon model predictive control with deadlock resolution. The MPC is formulated as a convex optimization over the proposed modified buffered Voronoi with warning band. Based on this formulation, the condition of deadlocks is formally analyzed and proven to be analogous to a force equilibrium. A detection-resolution scheme is proposed, which can effectively detect deadlocks online before they even happen. Once detected, it utilizes an adaptive resolution scheme to resolve deadlocks, under which no stable deadlocks can exist under minor conditions. In addition, the proposed planning algorithm ensures recursive feasibility of the underlying optimization at each time step under both input and model constraints, is concurrent for all robots and requires only local communication. Comprehensive simulation and experiment studies are conducted over large-scale multi-robot systems. Significant improvements on success rate are reported, in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods and especially in crowded and high-speed scenarios.</p></details> | 16 pages, 15 figures |

However, the process of obtaining such guidance can be labor-intensive. This paper focuses on enhancing controllability in video synthesis by employing straightforward bounding boxes to guide the subject in various ways, all without the need for neural network training, finetuning, optimization at inference time, or the use of pre-existing videos. Our algorithm, TrailBlazer, is constructed upon a pre-trained (T2V) model, and easy to implement. The subject is directed by a bounding box through the proposed spatial and temporal attention map editing. Moreover, we introduce the concept of keyframing, allowing the subject trajectory and overall appearance to be guided by both a moving bounding box and corresponding prompts, without the need to provide a detailed mask. The method is efficient, with negligible additional computation relative to the underlying pre-trained model. Despite the simplicity of the bounding box guidance, the resulting motion is surprisingly natural, with emergent effects including perspective and movement toward the virtual camera as the box size increases.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 18 figures, Project Page: https://hohonu-vicml.github.io/Trailblazer.Page/</p></details> |

This iterative change can be naturally interpreted as a trajectory in network space -- a time series of networks -- and thus the training algorithm (e.g. gradient descent optimization of a suitable loss function) can be interpreted as a dynamical system in graph space. In order to illustrate this interpretation, here we study the dynamical properties of this process by analyzing through this lens the network trajectories of a shallow neural network, and its evolution through learning a simple classification task. We systematically consider different ranges of the learning rate and explore both the dynamical and orbital stability of the resulting network trajectories, finding hints of regular and chaotic behavior depending on the learning rate regime. Our findings are put in contrast to common wisdom on convergence properties of neural networks and dynamical systems theory. This work also contributes to the cross-fertilization of ideas between dynamical systems theory, network theory and machine learning</p></details> | 29 pages, 18 figures |
| **[Design and Simulation of Time-energy Optimal Anti-swing Trajectory Planner for Autonomous Tower Cranes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05581v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For autonomous crane lifting, optimal trajectories of the crane are required as reference inputs to the crane controller to facilitate feedforward control. Reducing the unactuated payload motion is a crucial issue for under-actuated tower cranes with spherical pendulum dynamics. The planned trajectory should be optimal in terms of both operating time and energy consumption, to facilitate optimum output spending optimum effort. This article proposes an anti-swing tower crane trajectory planner that can provide time-energy optimal solutions for the Computer-Aided Lift Planning (CALP) system developed at Nanyang Technological University, which facilitates collision-free lifting path planning of robotized tower cranes in autonomous construction sites. The current work introduces a trajectory planning module to the system that utilizes the geometric outputs from the path planning module and optimally scales them with time information. Firstly, analyzing the non-linear dynamics of the crane operations, the tower crane is established as differentially flat. Subsequently, the multi-objective trajectory optimization problems for all the crane operations are formulated in the flat output space through consideration of the mechanical and safety constraints. Two multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, namely Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) and Generalized Differential Evolution 3 (GDE3), are extensively compared via statistical measures based on the closeness of solutions to the Pareto front, distribution of solutions in the solution space and the runtime, to select the optimization engine of the planner. Finally, the crane operation trajectories are obtained via the corresponding planned flat output trajectories. Studies simulating real-world lifting scenarios are conducted to verify the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed module of the lift planning system.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 12 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

The current auto-bidding algorithms typically employ reinforcement learning (RL). However, due to safety concerns, most RL-based auto-bidding policies are trained in simulation, leading to a performance degradation when deployed in online environments. To narrow this gap, we can deploy multiple auto-bidding agents in parallel to collect a large interaction dataset. Offline RL algorithms can then be utilized to train a new policy. The trained policy can subsequently be deployed for further data collection, resulting in an iterative training framework, which we refer to as iterative offline RL. In this work, we identify the performance bottleneck of this iterative offline RL framework, which originates from the ineffective exploration and exploitation caused by the inherent conservatism of offline RL algorithms. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose Trajectory-wise Exploration and Exploitation (TEE), which introduces a novel data collecting and data utilization method for iterative offline RL from a trajectory perspective. Furthermore, to ensure the safety of online exploration while preserving the dataset quality for TEE, we propose Safe Exploration by Adaptive Action Selection (SEAS). Both offline experiments and real-world experiments on Alibaba display advertising platform demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Web Conference 2024 (WWW'24) as an oral paper</p></details> |
| **[Collision-Free Trajectory Optimization in Cluttered Environments with Sums-of-Squares Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05242v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a trajectory optimization approach for robot navigation in cluttered 3D environments. We represent the robot's geometry as a semialgebraic set defined by polynomial inequalities such that robots with general shapes can be suitably characterized. To address the robot navigation task in obstacle-dense environments, we exploit the free space directly to construct a sequence of free regions, and allocate each waypoint on the trajectory to a specific region. Then, we incorporate a uniform scaling factor for each free region, and formulate a Sums-of-Squares (SOS) optimization problem that renders the containment relationship between the robot and the free space computationally tractable. The SOS optimization problem is further reformulated to a semidefinite program (SDP), and the collision-free constraints are shown to be equivalent to limiting the scaling factor along the entire trajectory. In this context, the robot at a specific configuration is tailored to stay within the free region. Next, to solve the trajectory optimization problem with the proposed safety constraints (which are implicitly dependent on the robot configurations), we derive the analytical solution to the gradient of the minimum scaling factor with respect to the robot configuration. As a result, this seamlessly facilitates the use of gradient-based methods in efficient solving of the trajectory optimization problem. Through a series of simulations and real-world experiments, the proposed trajectory optimization approach is validated in various challenging scenarios, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in generating collision-free trajectories in dense and intricate environments populated with obstacles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-agent Long-term 3D Human Pose Forecasting via Interaction-aware Trajectory Conditioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05218v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose forecasting garners attention for its diverse applications. However, challenges in modeling the multi-modal nature of human motion and intricate interactions among agents persist, particularly with longer timescales and more agents. In this paper, we propose an interaction-aware trajectory-conditioned long-term multi-agent human pose forecasting model, utilizing a coarse-to-fine prediction approach: multi-modal global trajectories are initially forecasted, followed by respective local pose forecasts conditioned on each mode. In doing so, our Trajectory2Pose model introduces a graph-based agent-wise interaction module for a reciprocal forecast of local motion-conditioned global trajectory and trajectory-conditioned local pose. Our model effectively handles the multi-modality of human motion and the complexity of long-term multi-agent interactions, improving performance in complex environments. Furthermore, we address the lack of long-term (6s+) multi-agent (5+) datasets by constructing a new dataset from real-world images and 2D annotations, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of our proposed model. State-of-the-art prediction performance on both complex and simpler datasets confirms the generalized effectiveness of our method.

| **[MVSA-Net: Multi-View State-Action Recognition for Robust and Deployable Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08393v3)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The learn-from-observation (LfO) paradigm is a human-inspired mode for a robot to learn to perform a task simply by watching it being performed. LfO can facilitate robot integration on factory floors by minimizing disruption and reducing tedious programming. A key component of the LfO pipeline is a transformation of the depth camera frames to the corresponding task state and action pairs, which are then relayed to learning techniques such as imitation or inverse reinforcement learning for understanding the task parameters. While several existing computer vision models analyze videos for activity recognition, SA-Net specifically targets robotic LfO from RGB-D data. However, SA-Net and many other models analyze frame data captured from a single viewpoint. Their analysis is therefore highly sensitive to occlusions of the observed task, which are frequent in deployments. An obvious way of reducing occlusions is to simultaneously observe the task from multiple viewpoints and synchronously fuse the multiple streams in the model. Toward this, we present multi-view SA-Net, which generalizes the SA-Net model to allow the perception of multiple viewpoints of the task activity, integrate them, and better recognize the state and action in each frame. Performance evaluations on two distinct domains establish that MVSA-Net recognizes the state-action pairs under occlusion more accurately compared to single-view MVSA-Net and other baselines. Our ablation studies further evaluate its performance under different ambient conditions and establish the contribution of the architecture components. As such, MVSA-Net offers a significantly more robust and deployable state-action trajectory generation compared to previous methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at Deployable AI Workshop at AAAI-2024 and 'Towards Reliable and Deployable Learning-Based Robotic Systems' Workshop at CoRL2023</p></details> |

In this regard, a common shortcoming of current benchmark datasets is their limitation to sets of sample trajectories and a lack of actual ground truth distributions, which prevents the use of more expressive error metrics, such as the Wasserstein distance for model evaluation. Towards this end, this paper proposes a novel approach to synthetic dataset generation based on composite probabilistic B\'ezier curves, which is capable of generating ground truth data in terms of probability distributions over full trajectories. This allows the calculation of arbitrary posterior distributions. The paper showcases an exemplary trajectory prediction model evaluation using generated ground truth distribution data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction Methods with Respect to Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05194v3)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we assess the state of the art in pedestrian trajectory prediction within the context of generating single trajectories, a critical aspect aligning with the requirements in autonomous systems. The evaluation is conducted on the widely-used ETH/UCY dataset where the Average Displacement Error (ADE) and the Final Displacement Error (FDE) are reported. Alongside this, we perform an ablation study to investigate the impact of the observed motion history on prediction performance. To evaluate the scalability of each approach when confronted with varying amounts of agents, the inference time of each model is measured. Following a quantitative analysis, the resulting predictions are compared in a qualitative manner, giving insight into the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches. The results demonstrate that although a constant velocity model (CVM) provides a good approximation of the overall dynamics in the majority of cases, additional features need to be incorporated to reflect common pedestrian behavior observed. Therefore, this study presents a data-driven analysis with the intent to guide the future development of pedestrian trajectory prediction algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS); 11 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Improving Autonomous Driving Safety with POP: A Framework for Accurate Partially Observed Trajectory Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15685v2)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction is crucial for safe and efficient autonomous driving, but handling partial observations presents significant challenges. To address this, we propose a novel trajectory prediction framework called Partial Observations Prediction (POP) for congested urban road scenarios. The framework consists of two key stages: self-supervised learning (SSL) and feature distillation. POP first employs SLL to help the model learn to reconstruct history representations, and then utilizes feature distillation as the fine-tuning task to transfer knowledge from the teacher model, which has been pre-trained with complete observations, to the student model, which has only few observations. POP achieves comparable results to top-performing methods in open-loop experiments and outperforms the baseline method in closed-loop simulations, including safety metrics. Qualitative results illustrate the superiority of POP in providing reasonable and safe trajectory predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear Kalman Filtering based on Self-Attention Mechanism and Lattice Trajectory Piecewise Linear Approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03915v1)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The traditional Kalman filter (KF) is widely applied in control systems, but it relies heavily on the accuracy of the system model and noise parameters, leading to potential performance degradation when facing inaccuracies. To address this issue, introducing neural networks into the KF framework offers a data-driven solution to compensate for these inaccuracies, improving the filter's performance while maintaining interpretability. Nevertheless, existing studies mostly employ recurrent neural network (RNN), which fails to fully capture the dependencies among state sequences and lead to an unstable training process. In this paper, we propose a novel Kalman filtering algorithm named the attention Kalman filter (AtKF), which incorporates a self-attention network to capture the dependencies among state sequences. To address the instability in the recursive training process, a parallel pre-training strategy is devised. Specifically, this strategy involves piecewise linearizing the system via lattice trajectory piecewise linear (LTPWL) expression, and generating pre-training data through a batch estimation algorithm, which exploits the self-attention mechanism's parallel processing ability. Experimental results on a two-dimensional nonlinear system demonstrate that AtKF outperforms other filters under noise disturbances and model mismatches.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

In the context of an asteroid deflection mission, accurately predicting deflection is crucial to determining the spacecraft's trajectory that will produce the desired outcome. However, the dynamics involved are intricate, and simplistic models may not fully capture the system's complexity. This study assesses the precision and limitations of analytical models in predicting deflection, comparing them to more accurate numerical simulations. The findings reveal that encounters with perturbing bodies, even at significant distances (a dozen times the radii of the sphere of influence of the perturbing planet), can markedly disturb the deflected asteroid's trajectory, resulting in notable disparities between analytical and numerical predictions. The underlying reasons for this phenomenon are explained, and provisional general guidelines are provided to assist mission analysts in addressing such occurrences. By comprehending the impact of shallow encounters on deflection, this study equips designers with the knowledge to make informed decisions throughout the trajectory planning process, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of asteroid deflection missions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the AIAA's Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics.

In contrast to the prevalent practice of validating RL models based on their optimal behavior learned during training, we posit that considering a range of edge-case trajectories provides a more comprehensive understanding of their inherent behavior. To induce such scenarios, we introduce a disturbance to the initial state, optimizing it through an evolutionary algorithm to generate a diverse population of demonstrations. To evaluate the fitness of trajectories, REACT incorporates a joint fitness function that encourages both local and global diversity in the encountered states and chosen actions. Through assessments with policies trained for varying durations in discrete and continuous environments, we demonstrate the descriptive power of REACT. Our results highlight its effectiveness in revealing nuanced aspects of RL models' behavior beyond optimal performance, thereby contributing to improved interpretability.</p></details> | 12 pages, 12 figures |

However, current systems fall short of matching human-level of intelligence in terms of adapting to novel tools. Prior works based on affordance often make strong assumptions about the environments and cannot scale to more complex, contact-rich tasks. In this work, we tackle this challenge and explore how agents can learn to use previously unseen tools to manipulate deformable objects. We propose to learn a generative model of the tool-use trajectories as a sequence of tool point clouds, which generalizes to different tool shapes. Given any novel tool, we first generate a tool-use trajectory and then optimize the sequence of tool poses to align with the generated trajectory. We train a single model on four different challenging deformable object manipulation tasks, using demonstration data from only one tool per task. The model generalizes to various novel tools, significantly outperforming baselines. We further test our trained policy in the real world with unseen tools, where it achieves the performance comparable to human.

Such tasks are designed to assess whether novices have developed the analytical skills to translate from the given problem domain to coding. In the past researchers have used instruments such as code-explain and found that the extent of cognitive depth reached in these tasks correlated well with code writing ability. However, the need for manual marking and personalized interviews used for identifying cognitive difficulties limited the study to a small group of stragglers. To extend this work to larger groups, we have devised several question types with varying cognitive demands collectively called Algorithmic Reasoning Tasks (ARTs), which do not require manual marking. These tasks require levels of reasoning which can define a learning trajectory. This paper describes these instruments and the machine learning models used for validating them. We have used the data collected in an introductory programming course in the penultimate week of the semester which required attempting ART type instruments and code writing. Our preliminary research suggests ART type instruments can be combined with specific machine learning models to act as an effective learning trajectory and early prediction of code-writing skills.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Existing approaches in this field often assume precise and complete observational data, neglecting the challenges associated with out-of-view objects and the noise inherent in sensor data due to limited camera range, physical obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised sensor data. Such oversights are critical safety concerns, as they can result in missing essential, non-visible objects. To bridge this gap, we present a novel method for out-of-sight trajectory prediction that leverages a vision-positioning technique. Our approach denoises noisy sensor observations in an unsupervised manner and precisely maps sensor-based trajectories of out-of-sight objects into visual trajectories. This method has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in out-of-sight noisy sensor trajectory denoising and prediction on the Vi-Fi and JRDB datasets. By enhancing trajectory prediction accuracy and addressing the challenges of out-of-sight objects, our work significantly contributes to improving the safety and reliability of autonomous driving in complex environments. Our work represents the first initiative towards Out-Of-Sight Trajectory prediction (OOSTraj), setting a new benchmark for future research.

However, the lack of sensors often results in incomplete traffic state data, making it challenging to obtain reliable information for decision-making. This paper proposes a novel method for imputing traffic state data using Gaussian processes (GP) to address this issue. We propose a kernel rotation re-parametrization scheme that transforms a standard isotropic GP kernel into an anisotropic kernel, which can better model the congestion propagation in traffic flow data. The model parameters can be estimated by statistical inference using data from sparse probe vehicles or loop detectors. Moreover, the rotated GP method provides statistical uncertainty quantification for the imputed traffic state, making it more reliable. We also extend our approach to a multi-output GP, which allows for simultaneously estimating the traffic state for multiple lanes. We evaluate our method using real-world traffic data from the Next Generation simulation (NGSIM) and HighD programs, along with simulated data representing a traffic bottleneck scenario. Considering current and future mixed traffic of connected vehicles (CVs) and human-driven vehicles (HVs), we experiment with the traffic state estimation (TSE) scheme from 5% to 50% available trajectories, mimicking different CV penetration rates in a mixed traffic environment. We also test the traffic state estimation when traffic flow information is obtained from loop detectors. The results demonstrate the adaptability of our TSE method across different CV penetration rates and types of detectors, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in scenarios with sparse observation rates.</p></details> |  |

We propose two prior attention modules, namely Kinematics Prior Attention (KPA) and Trajectory Prior Attention (TPA) to take advantage of the known anatomical structure of the human body and motion trajectory information, to facilitate effective learning of global dependencies and features in the multi-head self-attention. KPA models kinematic relationships in the human body by constructing a topology of kinematics, while TPA builds a trajectory topology to learn the information of joint motion trajectory across frames. Yielding Q, K, V vectors with prior knowledge, the two modules enable KTPFormer to model both spatial and temporal correlations simultaneously. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks (Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP and HumanEva) show that KTPFormer achieves superior performance in comparison to state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, our KPA and TPA modules have lightweight plug-and-play designs and can be integrated into various transformer-based networks (i.e., diffusion-based) to improve the performance with only a very small increase in the computational overhead.

| **[Traffic State Estimation and Uncertainty Quantification at Signalized Intersections with Low Penetration Rate Vehicle Trajectory Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08667v1)** | 2024-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the traffic state estimation problem at signalized intersections with low penetration rate vehicle trajectory data. While many existing studies have proposed different methods to estimate unknown traffic states and parameters (e.g., penetration rate, queue length) with this data, most of them only provide a point estimation without knowing the uncertainty of these estimated values. It is important to quantify the estimation uncertainty caused by limited available data since it can explicitly inform us whether the available data is sufficient to satisfy the desired estimation accuracy. To fill this gap, we formulate the partially observable system as a hidden Markov model (HMM) based on the recently developed probabilistic time-space (PTS) model. The PTS model is a stochastic traffic flow model that is designed for modeling traffic flow dynamics near signalized intersections. Based on the HMM formulation, a single recursive program is developed for the Bayesian estimation of both traffic states and parameters. As a Bayesian approach, the proposed method provides the distributional estimation outcomes and directly quantifies the estimation uncertainty. We validate the proposed method with simulation studies and showcase its applicability to real-world vehicle trajectory data.</p></details> |  |

While such discrepancies can be alleviated with more complex models, this often complicates controller design and implementation. By leveraging the fact that many trajectories of interest are periodic, we show that perfect tracking is possible when incorporating a simple observer that estimates and compensates for periodic disturbances. We present the design of the observer and the accompanying tracking MPC scheme, proving that their combination achieves zero tracking error asymptotically, regardless of the complexity of the unmodelled dynamics. We validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating asymptotically perfect tracking on a high-dimensional soft robot with nearly 10,000 states and a fivefold reduction in tracking errors compared to a baseline MPC on small-scale autonomous race car experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, Submitted to the 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024)</p></details> |

In this paper, we address this issue by combining a deep learning-based trajectory prediction model with risk potential field-based motion planning. In order to comprehensively predict the possible future trajectories of other vehicles, we propose a target-region based trajectory prediction model(TRTP) which considers every region a vehicle may arrive in the future. After that, we construct a risk potential field at each future time step based on the prediction results of TRTP, and integrate risk value to the objective function of Model Predictive Contouring Control(MPCC). This enables the uncertainty of other vehicles to be taken into account during the planning process. Balancing between risk and progress along the reference path can achieve both driving safety and efficiency at the same time. We also demonstrate the security and effectiveness performance of our method in the CARLA simulator.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches mainly focus on developing compact neural networks to increase prediction precision on public datasets, typically employing a standardized input duration. However, a notable issue arises when these models are evaluated with varying observation lengths, leading to a significant performance drop, a phenomenon we term the Observation Length Shift. To address this issue, we introduce a general and effective framework, the FlexiLength Network (FLN), to enhance the robustness of existing trajectory prediction techniques against varying observation periods. Specifically, FLN integrates trajectory data with diverse observation lengths, incorporates FlexiLength Calibration (FLC) to acquire temporal invariant representations, and employs FlexiLength Adaptation (FLA) to further refine these representations for more accurate future trajectory predictions. Comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets, ie, ETH/UCY, nuScenes, and Argoverse 1, demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our proposed FLN framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024</p></details> |

| **[Consistency Trajectory Models: Learning Probability Flow ODE Trajectory of Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02279v3)** | 2024-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consistency Models (CM) (Song et al., 2023) accelerate score-based diffusion model sampling at the cost of sample quality but lack a natural way to trade-off quality for speed. To address this limitation, we propose Consistency Trajectory Model (CTM), a generalization encompassing CM and score-based models as special cases. CTM trains a single neural network that can -- in a single forward pass -- output scores (i.e., gradients of log-density) and enables unrestricted traversal between any initial and final time along the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in a diffusion process. CTM enables the efficient combination of adversarial training and denoising score matching loss to enhance performance and achieves new state-of-the-art FIDs for single-step diffusion model sampling on CIFAR-10 (FID 1.73) and ImageNet at 64x64 resolution (FID 1.92). CTM also enables a new family of sampling schemes, both deterministic and stochastic, involving long jumps along the ODE solution trajectories. It consistently improves sample quality as computational budgets increase, avoiding the degradation seen in CM. Furthermore, unlike CM, CTM's access to the score function can streamline the adoption of established controllable/conditional generation methods from the diffusion community. This access also enables the computation of likelihood.

Such a robot needs to be able to predict the ego motion of the wearer based on egocentric vision and the surrounding scene. In this work, we leveraged body-mounted cameras and sensors to anticipate the trajectory of human wearers through complex surroundings. To facilitate research in ego-motion prediction, we have collected a comprehensive walking scene navigation dataset centered on the user's perspective. We present a method to predict human motion conditioning on the surrounding static scene. Our method leverages a diffusion model to produce a distribution of potential future trajectories, taking into account the user's observation of the environment. We introduce a compact representation to encode the user's visual memory of the surroundings, as well as an efficient sample-generating technique to speed up real-time inference of a diffusion model. We ablate our model and compare it to baselines, and results show that our model outperforms existing methods on key metrics of collision avoidance and trajectory mode coverage.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Joint Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction through Posterior Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00237v1)** | 2024-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint pedestrian trajectory prediction has long grappled with the inherent unpredictability of human behaviors. Recent investigations employing variants of conditional diffusion models in trajectory prediction have exhibited notable success. Nevertheless, the heavy dependence on accurate historical data results in their vulnerability to noise disturbances and data incompleteness. To improve the robustness and reliability, we introduce the Guided Full Trajectory Diffuser (GFTD), a novel diffusion model framework that captures the joint full (historical and future) trajectory distribution. By learning from the full trajectory, GFTD can recover the noisy and missing data, hence improving the robustness. In addition, GFTD can adapt to data imperfections without additional training requirements, leveraging posterior sampling for reliable prediction and controllable generation. Our approach not only simplifies the prediction process but also enhances generalizability in scenarios with noise and incomplete inputs. Through rigorous experimental evaluation, GFTD exhibits superior performance in both trajectory prediction and controllable generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[SURESTEP: An Uncertainty-Aware Trajectory Optimization Framework to Enhance Visual Tool Tracking for Robust Surgical Automation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00123v1)** | 2024-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inaccurate tool localization is one of the main reasons for failures in automating surgical tasks. Imprecise robot kinematics and noisy observations caused by the poor visual acuity of an endoscopic camera make tool tracking challenging. Previous works in surgical automation adopt environment-specific setups or hard-coded strategies instead of explicitly considering motion and observation uncertainty of tool tracking in their policies. In this work, we present SURESTEP, an uncertainty-aware trajectory optimization framework for robust surgical automation. We model the uncertainty of tool tracking with the components motivated by the sources of noise in typical surgical scenes. Using a Gaussian assumption to propagate our uncertainty models through a given tool trajectory, SURESTEP provides a general framework that minimizes the upper bound on the entropy of the final estimated tool distribution. We compare SURESTEP with a baseline method on a real-world suture needle regrasping task under challenging environmental conditions, such as poor lighting and a moving endoscopic camera. The results over 60 regrasps on the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) demonstrate that our optimized trajectories significantly outperform the un-optimized baseline.</p></details> |  |

Finally, simulations were conducted on a quadcopter to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme under two typical collision-free trajectories.</p></details> |  |
| **[SingularTrajectory: Universal Trajectory Predictor Using Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18452v1)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are five types of trajectory prediction tasks: deterministic, stochastic, domain adaptation, momentary observation, and few-shot. These associated tasks are defined by various factors, such as the length of input paths, data split and pre-processing methods. Interestingly, even though they commonly take sequential coordinates of observations as input and infer future paths in the same coordinates as output, designing specialized architectures for each task is still necessary. For the other task, generality issues can lead to sub-optimal performances. In this paper, we propose SingularTrajectory, a diffusion-based universal trajectory prediction framework to reduce the performance gap across the five tasks. The core of SingularTrajectory is to unify a variety of human dynamics representations on the associated tasks. To do this, we first build a Singular space to project all types of motion patterns from each task into one embedding space. We next propose an adaptive anchor working in the Singular space. Unlike traditional fixed anchor methods that sometimes yield unacceptable paths, our adaptive anchor enables correct anchors, which are put into a wrong location, based on a traversability map. Finally, we adopt a diffusion-based predictor to further enhance the prototype paths using a cascaded denoising process. Our unified framework ensures the generality across various benchmark settings such as input modality, and trajectory lengths. Extensive experiments on five public benchmarks demonstrate that SingularTrajectory substantially outperforms existing models, highlighting its effectiveness in estimating general dynamics of human movements.

Language-Based Multimodal Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18447v1)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models have demonstrated impressive ability in context understanding and generative performance. Inspired by the recent success of language foundation models, in this paper, we propose LMTraj (Language-based Multimodal Trajectory predictor), which recasts the trajectory prediction task into a sort of question-answering problem. Departing from traditional numerical regression models, which treat the trajectory coordinate sequence as continuous signals, we consider them as discrete signals like text prompts. Specially, we first transform an input space for the trajectory coordinate into the natural language space. Here, the entire time-series trajectories of pedestrians are converted into a text prompt, and scene images are described as text information through image captioning. The transformed numerical and image data are then wrapped into the question-answering template for use in a language model. Next, to guide the language model in understanding and reasoning high-level knowledge, such as scene context and social relationships between pedestrians, we introduce an auxiliary multi-task question and answering. We then train a numerical tokenizer with the prompt data. We encourage the tokenizer to separate the integer and decimal parts well, and leverage it to capture correlations between the consecutive numbers in the language model. Lastly, we train the language model using the numerical tokenizer and all of the question-answer prompts. Here, we propose a beam-search-based most-likely prediction and a temperature-based multimodal prediction to implement both deterministic and stochastic inferences. Applying our LMTraj, we show that the language-based model can be a powerful pedestrian trajectory predictor, and outperforms existing numerical-based predictor methods.

While these questions can be studied by employing multiple datasets, it is challenging due to several discrepancies, e.g., in data formats, map resolution, and semantic annotation types. To address these challenges, we introduce UniTraj, a comprehensive framework that unifies various datasets, models, and evaluation criteria, presenting new opportunities for the vehicle trajectory prediction field. In particular, using UniTraj, we conduct extensive experiments and find that model performance significantly drops when transferred to other datasets. However, enlarging data size and diversity can substantially improve performance, leading to a new state-of-the-art result for the nuScenes dataset. We provide insights into dataset characteristics to explain these findings. The code can be found here: https://github.com/vita-epfl/UniTraj</p></details> |  |
| **[World Models via Policy-Guided Trajectory Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08533v4)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models are a powerful tool for developing intelligent agents. By predicting the outcome of a sequence of actions, world models enable policies to be optimised via on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) using synthetic data, i.e. in "in imagination". Existing world models are autoregressive in that they interleave predicting the next state with sampling the next action from the policy. Prediction error inevitably compounds as the trajectory length grows. In this work, we propose a novel world modelling approach that is not autoregressive and generates entire on-policy trajectories in a single pass through a diffusion model. Our approach, Policy-Guided Trajectory Diffusion (PolyGRAD), leverages a denoising model in addition to the gradient of the action distribution of the policy to diffuse a trajectory of initially random states and actions into an on-policy synthetic trajectory. We analyse the connections between PolyGRAD, score-based generative models, and classifier-guided diffusion models. Our results demonstrate that PolyGRAD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of trajectory prediction error for short trajectories, with the exception of autoregressive diffusion. For short trajectories, PolyGRAD obtains similar errors to autoregressive diffusion, but with lower computational requirements. For long trajectories, PolyGRAD obtains comparable performance to baselines. Our experiments demonstrate that PolyGRAD enables performant policies to be trained via on-policy RL in imagination for MuJoCo continuous control domains. Thus, PolyGRAD introduces a new paradigm for accurate on-policy world modelling without autoregressive sampling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in TMLR, March 2024</p></details> |

Existing motion prediction approaches have ample room for improvement, particularly in terms of long-term prediction accuracy and interpretability. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing LC-LLM, an explainable lane change prediction model that leverages the strong reasoning capabilities and self-explanation abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Essentially, we reformulate the lane change prediction task as a language modeling problem, processing heterogeneous driving scenario information in natural language as prompts for input into the LLM and employing a supervised fine-tuning technique to tailor the LLM specifically for our lane change prediction task. This allows us to utilize the LLM's powerful common sense reasoning abilities to understand complex interactive information, thereby improving the accuracy of long-term predictions. Furthermore, we incorporate explanatory requirements into the prompts in the inference stage. Therefore, our LC-LLM model not only can predict lane change intentions and trajectories but also provides explanations for its predictions, enhancing the interpretability. Extensive experiments on the large-scale highD dataset demonstrate the superior performance and interpretability of our LC-LLM in lane change prediction task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize LLMs for predicting lane change behavior. Our study shows that LLMs can encode comprehensive interaction information for driving behavior understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Light Transformer Ensembles for Multimodal Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17678v1)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory forecasting is crucial for the performance of various systems, such as advanced driver-assistance systems and self-driving vehicles. These forecasts allow to anticipate events leading to collisions and, therefore, to mitigate them. Deep Neural Networks have excelled in motion forecasting, but issues like overconfidence and uncertainty quantification persist. Deep Ensembles address these concerns, yet applying them to multimodal distributions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Hierarchical Light Transformer Ensembles (HLT-Ens), aimed at efficiently training an ensemble of Transformer architectures using a novel hierarchical loss function. HLT-Ens leverages grouped fully connected layers, inspired by grouped convolution techniques, to capture multimodal distributions, effectively. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that HLT-Ens achieves state-of-the-art performance levels, offering a promising avenue for improving trajectory forecasting techniques.</p></details> |  |

The diversity and uncertainty in socially interactive behaviors among a rich variety of agents make this task more challenging than other deterministic computer vision tasks. Researchers have made a lot of efforts to quantify the effects of these interactions on future trajectories through different mathematical models and network structures, but this problem has not been well solved. Inspired by marine animals that localize the positions of their companions underwater through echoes, we build a new anglebased trainable social interaction representation, named SocialCircle, for continuously reflecting the context of social interactions at different angular orientations relative to the target agent. We validate the effect of the proposed SocialCircle by training it along with several newly released trajectory prediction models, and experiments show that the SocialCircle not only quantitatively improves the prediction performance, but also qualitatively helps better simulate social interactions when forecasting pedestrian trajectories in a way that is consistent with human intuitions.</p></details> | CVPR 2024 accepted |

| **[Offline Reinforcement Learning: Role of State Aggregation and Trajectory Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17091v1)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We revisit the problem of offline reinforcement learning with value function realizability but without Bellman completeness. Previous work by Xie and Jiang (2021) and Foster et al. (2022) left open the question whether a bounded concentrability coefficient along with trajectory-based offline data admits a polynomial sample complexity. In this work, we provide a negative answer to this question for the task of offline policy evaluation. In addition to addressing this question, we provide a rather complete picture for offline policy evaluation with only value function realizability. Our primary findings are threefold: 1) The sample complexity of offline policy evaluation is governed by the concentrability coefficient in an aggregated Markov Transition Model jointly determined by the function class and the offline data distribution, rather than that in the original MDP. This unifies and generalizes the ideas of Xie and Jiang (2021) and Foster et al. (2022), 2) The concentrability coefficient in the aggregated Markov Transition Model may grow exponentially with the horizon length, even when the concentrability coefficient in the original MDP is small and the offline data is admissible (i.e., the data distribution equals the occupancy measure of some policy), 3) Under value function realizability, there is a generic reduction that can convert any hard instance with admissible data to a hard instance with trajectory data, implying that trajectory data offers no extra benefits over admissible data. These three pieces jointly resolve the open problem, though each of them could be of independent interest.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization with Global Yaw Parameterization for Field-of-View Constrained Autonomous Flight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17067v1)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory generation for quadrotors with limited field-of-view sensors has numerous applications such as aerial exploration, coverage, inspection, videography, and target tracking. Most previous works simplify the task of optimizing yaw trajectories by either aligning the heading of the robot with its velocity, or potentially restricting the feasible space of candidate trajectories by using a limited yaw domain to circumvent angular singularities. In this paper, we propose a novel \textit{global} yaw parameterization method for trajectory optimization that allows a 360-degree yaw variation as demanded by the underlying algorithm. This approach effectively bypasses inherent singularities by including supplementary quadratic constraints and transforming the final decision variables into the desired state representation. This method significantly reduces the needed control effort, and improves optimization feasibility. Furthermore, we apply the method to several examples of different applications that require jointly optimizing over both the yaw and position trajectories. Ultimately, we present a comprehensive numerical analysis and evaluation of our proposed method in both simulation and real-world experiments.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this, we 1) decompose our polygonal environment into different overlapping cells 2) write out our polynomial trajectories as the output of a reference dynamical system with given initial conditions 3) formulate convergence and safety constraints as Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) on our controller using Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and 4) solve a semi-definite programming (SDP) problem with convergence and safety constraints imposed to synthesize a controller for each convex cell. Extensive simulations are included to test our motion planning method under different initial conditions and different reference trajectories. The synthesized controller is robust to changes in initial conditions and is always safe relative to the boundaries of the polygonal environment.</p></details> |  |

This paper for the first time proposes a surveillance system that utilizes low-cost magnetic sensors for detecting and tracking vehicles continuously along the road. The system uses multiple sensors mounted along the roadside and lane boundaries to capture the movement of vehicles. Real-time measurement data is collected by base stations and processed to produce vehicle trajectories that include position, timestamp, and speed. To address the challenge of tracking vehicles continuously on a road network using a large amount of unlabeled magnetic sensor measurements, we first define a vehicle trajectory tracking problem. We then propose a graph-based data association algorithm to track each detected vehicle, and design a related online algorithm framework respectively. We finally validate the performance via both experimental simulation and real-world road deployment. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution provides a cost-effective solution to capture the driving status of vehicles and on that basis form various traffic safety and efficiency applications.</p></details> |  |

As a result, many recent works have proposed methods for estimating HD maps online from sensor data, enabling AVs to operate outside of previously-mapped regions. However, current online map estimation approaches are developed in isolation of their downstream tasks, complicating their integration in AV stacks. In particular, they do not produce uncertainty or confidence estimates. In this work, we extend multiple state-of-the-art online map estimation methods to additionally estimate uncertainty and show how this enables more tightly integrating online mapping with trajectory forecasting. In doing so, we find that incorporating uncertainty yields up to 50% faster training convergence and up to 15% better prediction performance on the real-world nuScenes driving dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 14 figures, 6 tables.

Most existing works capture map information through an one-stage interaction with map by vector-based attention, to provide map constraints for social interaction and multi-modal differentiation. However, these methods have to encode all required map rules into the focal agent's feature, so as to retain all possible intentions' paths while at the meantime to adapt to potential social interaction. In this work, a progressive interaction network is proposed to enable the agent's feature to progressively focus on relevant maps, in order to better learn agents' feature representation capturing the relevant map constraints. The network progressively encode the complex influence of map constraints into the agent's feature through graph convolutions at the following three stages: after historical trajectory encoder, after social interaction, and after multi-modal differentiation. In addition, a weight allocation mechanism is proposed for multi-modal training, so that each mode can obtain learning opportunities from a single-mode ground truth. Experiments have validated the superiority of progressive interactions to the existing one-stage interaction, and demonstrate the effectiveness of each component. Encouraging results were obtained in the challenging benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, we propose an adaptive training method that ensures that the diffusion model generates more traversable trajectories.

Moreover, the uncertainty-aware learning procedures in probabilistic approaches lead to robust policies that are less sensitive to noisy observations compared to uncertainty unaware solutions. We propose to combine trajectory sampling and deep Gaussian covariance network (DGCN) for a data-efficient solution to MBRL problems in an optimal control setting. We compare trajectory sampling with density-based approximation for uncertainty propagation using three different probabilistic world models; Gaussian processes, Bayesian neural networks, and DGCNs. We provide empirical evidence using four different well-known test environments, that our method improves the sample-efficiency over other combinations of uncertainty propagation methods and probabilistic models. During our tests, we place particular emphasis on the robustness of the learned policies with respect to noisy initial states.</p></details> |  |

As a part of ITS, Vehicle Trajectory Prediction (VTP) aims to forecast a vehicle's future positions based on its past and current movements. VTP is a pivotal element for road safety, aiding in applications such as traffic management, accident prevention, work-zone safety, and energy optimization. While most works in this field focus on autonomous driving, with the growing number of surveillance cameras, another sub-field emerges for surveillance VTP with its own set of challenges. In this paper, we introduce VT-Former, a novel transformer-based VTP approach for highway safety and surveillance. In addition to utilizing transformers to capture long-range temporal patterns, a new Graph Attentive Tokenization (GAT) module has been proposed to capture intricate social interactions among vehicles.

In recent years, emerging data-driven deep learning-based methods have shown great promise for these two tasks in learning various traffic scenarios and improving average performance without assuming physical models. However, it remains a challenging problem for these methods to ensure that the generated/predicted trajectories are physically realistic. This challenge arises because learning-based approaches often function as opaque black boxes and do not adhere to physical laws. Conversely, existing model-based methods provide physically feasible results but are constrained by predefined model structures, limiting their capabilities to address complex scenarios. To address the limitations of these two types of approaches, we propose a new method that integrates kinematic knowledge into neural stochastic differential equations (SDE) and designs a variational autoencoder based on this latent kinematics-aware SDE (LK-SDE) to generate vehicle motions.

In this work, we address the problem of one-shot imitation from a single human demonstration, given by an RGB-D video recording through a two-stage process. In the first stage which is offline, we extract the trajectory of the demonstration. This entails segmenting manipulated objects and determining their relative motion in relation to secondary objects such as containers. Subsequently, in the live online trajectory generation stage, we first \mbox{re-detect} all objects, then we warp the demonstration trajectory to the current scene, and finally, we trace the trajectory with the robot. To complete these steps, our method makes leverages several ancillary models, including those for segmentation, relative object pose estimation, and grasp prediction. We systematically evaluate different combinations of correspondence and re-detection methods to validate our design decision across a diverse range of tasks. Specifically, we collect demonstrations of ten different tasks including pick-and-place tasks as well as articulated object manipulation. Finally, we perform extensive evaluations on a real robot system to demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of our approach in real-world scenarios. We make the code publicly available at http://ditto.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, submitted to IROS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Regularization Enhances Self-Supervised Geometric Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14973v1)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has proven effective in learning high-quality representations for various downstream tasks, with a primary focus on semantic tasks. However, its application in geometric tasks remains underexplored, partially due to the absence of a standardized evaluation method for geometric representations. To address this gap, we introduce a new pose-estimation benchmark for assessing SSL geometric representations, which demands training without semantic or pose labels and achieving proficiency in both semantic and geometric downstream tasks. On this benchmark, we study enhancing SSL geometric representations without sacrificing semantic classification accuracy. We find that leveraging mid-layer representations improves pose-estimation performance by 10-20%. Further, we introduce an unsupervised trajectory-regularization loss, which improves performance by an additional 4% and improves generalization ability on out-of-distribution data. We hope the proposed benchmark and methods offer new insights and improvements in self-supervised geometric representation learning.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods, focusing on simplistic spatio-temporal features, face challenges of complex calculations, limited scalability, and inadequate adaptability to real-world complexities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the development and recent advances in deep learning for trajectory computing (DL4Traj). We first define trajectory data and provide a brief overview of widely-used deep learning models. Systematically, we explore deep learning applications in trajectory management (pre-processing, storage, analysis, and visualization) and mining (trajectory-related forecasting, trajectory-related recommendation, trajectory classification, travel time estimation, anomaly detection, and mobility generation). Notably, we encapsulate recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) that hold the potential to augment trajectory computing. Additionally, we summarize application scenarios, public datasets, and toolkits. Finally, we outline current challenges in DL4Traj research and propose future directions.

| **[A Physics Enhanced Residual Learning (PERL) Framework for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15284v2)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In vehicle trajectory prediction, physics models and data-driven models are two predominant methodologies. However, each approach presents its own set of challenges: physics models fall short in predictability, while data-driven models lack interpretability. Addressing these identified shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel framework, the Physics-Enhanced Residual Learning (PERL) model. PERL integrates the strengths of physics-based and data-driven methods for traffic state prediction. PERL contains a physics model and a residual learning model. Its prediction is the sum of the physics model result and a predicted residual as a correction to it. It preserves the interpretability inherent to physics-based models and has reduced data requirements compared to data-driven methods. Experiments were conducted using a real-world vehicle trajectory dataset. We proposed a PERL model, with the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) as its physics car-following model and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) as its residual learning model. We compare this PERL model with the physics car-following model, data-driven model, and other physics-informed neural network (PINN) models. The result reveals that PERL achieves better prediction with a small dataset, compared to the physics model, data-driven model, and PINN model. Second, the PERL model showed faster convergence during training, offering comparable performance with fewer training samples than the data-driven model and PINN model. Sensitivity analysis also proves comparable performance of PERL using another residual learning model and a physics car-following model.</p></details> |  |

While numerous strategies have been developed to enhance the robustness of trajectory prediction models, these methods are predominantly heuristic and do not offer guaranteed robustness against adversarial attacks and noisy observations. In this work, we propose a certification approach tailored for the task of trajectory prediction. To this end, we address the inherent challenges associated with trajectory prediction, including unbounded outputs, and mutli-modality, resulting in a model that provides guaranteed robustness. Furthermore, we integrate a denoiser into our method to further improve the performance. Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique across various baselines and using standard trajectory prediction datasets.

Motivated by the pivotal role trajectory length plays in the training process, we introduce Ada-NAV, a novel adaptive trajectory length scheme designed to enhance the training sample efficiency of RL algorithms in robotic navigation tasks. Unlike traditional approaches that treat trajectory length as a fixed hyperparameter, we propose to dynamically adjust it based on the entropy of the underlying navigation policy. Interestingly, Ada-NAV can be applied to both existing on-policy and off-policy RL methods, which we demonstrate by empirically validating its efficacy on three popular RL methods: REINFORCE, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). We demonstrate through simulated and real-world robotic experiments that Ada-NAV outperforms conventional methods that employ constant or randomly sampled trajectory lengths. Specifically, for a fixed sample budget, Ada-NAV achieves an 18\% increase in navigation success rate, a 20-38\% reduction in navigation path length, and a 9.32\% decrease in elevation costs. Furthermore, we showcase the versatility of Ada-NAV by integrating it with the Clearpath Husky robot, illustrating its applicability in complex outdoor environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Progressive trajectory matching for medical dataset distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13469v1)** | 2024-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is essential but challenging to share medical image datasets due to privacy issues, which prohibit building foundation models and knowledge transfer. In this paper, we propose a novel dataset distillation method to condense the original medical image datasets into a synthetic one that preserves useful information for building an analysis model without accessing the original datasets. Existing methods tackle only natural images by randomly matching parts of the training trajectories of the model parameters trained by the whole real datasets. However, through extensive experiments on medical image datasets, the training process is extremely unstable and achieves inferior distillation results. To solve these barriers, we propose to design a novel progressive trajectory matching strategy to improve the training stability for medical image dataset distillation. Additionally, it is observed that improved stability prevents the synthetic dataset diversity and final performance improvements. Therefore, we propose a dynamic overlap mitigation module that improves the synthetic dataset diversity by dynamically eliminating the overlap across different images and retraining parts of the synthetic images for better convergence. Finally, we propose a new medical image dataset distillation benchmark of various modalities and configurations to promote fair evaluations. It is validated that our proposed method achieves 8.33% improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods on average, and 11.7% improvement when ipc=2 (i.e., image per class is 2). Codes and benchmarks will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[A novel methodological framework for the analysis of health trajectories and survival outcomes in heart failure patients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03138v2)** | 2024-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heart failure (HF) contributes to circa 200,000 annual hospitalizations in France. With the increasing age of HF patients, elucidating the specific causes of inpatient mortality became a public health problematic. We introduce a novel methodological framework designed to identify prevalent health trajectories and investigate their impact on death. The initial step involves applying sequential pattern mining to characterize patients' trajectories, followed by an unsupervised clustering algorithm based on a new metric for measuring the distance between hospitalization diagnoses. Finally, a survival analysis is conducted to assess survival outcomes. The application of this framework to HF patients from a representative sample of the French population demonstrates its methodological significance in enhancing the analysis of healthcare trajectories.</p></details> |  |
| **[CaDRE: Controllable and Diverse Generation of Safety-Critical Driving Scenarios using Real-World Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13208v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation is an indispensable tool in the development and testing of autonomous vehicles (AVs), offering an efficient and safe alternative to road testing by allowing the exploration of a wide range of scenarios. Despite its advantages, a significant challenge within simulation-based testing is the generation of safety-critical scenarios, which are essential to ensure that AVs can handle rare but potentially fatal situations. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a novel generative framework, CaDRE, which is specifically designed for generating diverse and controllable safety-critical scenarios using real-world trajectories. Our approach optimizes for both the quality and diversity of scenarios by employing a unique formulation and algorithm that integrates real-world data, domain knowledge, and black-box optimization techniques. We validate the effectiveness of our framework through extensive testing in three representative types of traffic scenarios. The results demonstrate superior performance in generating diverse and high-quality scenarios with greater sample efficiency than existing reinforcement learning and sampling-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Flow Matching: Learning Straight Trajectories in Just One Step](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13117v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the several recent years, there has been a boom in development of flow matching methods for generative modeling. One intriguing property pursued by the community is the ability to learn flows with straight trajectories which realize the optimal transport (OT) displacements. Straightness is crucial for fast integration of the learned flow's paths. Unfortunately, most existing flow straightening methods are based on non-trivial iterative procedures which accumulate the error during training or exploit heuristic minibatch OT approximations. To address this issue, we develop a novel optimal flow matching approach which recovers the straight OT displacement for the quadratic cost in just one flow matching step.</p></details> |  |
| **[D-Cubed: Latent Diffusion Trajectory Optimisation for Dexterous Deformable Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12861v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mastering dexterous robotic manipulation of deformable objects is vital for overcoming the limitations of parallel grippers in real-world applications. Current trajectory optimisation approaches often struggle to solve such tasks due to the large search space and the limited task information available from a cost function. In this work, we propose D-Cubed, a novel trajectory optimisation method using a latent diffusion model (LDM) trained from a task-agnostic play dataset to solve dexterous deformable object manipulation tasks. D-Cubed learns a skill-latent space that encodes short-horizon actions in the play dataset using a VAE and trains a LDM to compose the skill latents into a skill trajectory, representing a long-horizon action trajectory in the dataset. To optimise a trajectory for a target task, we introduce a novel gradient-free guided sampling method that employs the Cross-Entropy method within the reverse diffusion process. In particular, D-Cubed samples a small number of noisy skill trajectories using the LDM for exploration and evaluates the trajectories in simulation. Then, D-Cubed selects the trajectory with the lowest cost for the subsequent reverse process. This effectively explores promising solution areas and optimises the sampled trajectories towards a target task throughout the reverse diffusion process. Through empirical evaluation on a public benchmark of dexterous deformable object manipulation tasks, we demonstrate that D-Cubed outperforms traditional trajectory optimisation and competitive baseline approaches by a significant margin. We further demonstrate that trajectories found by D-Cubed readily transfer to a real-world LEAP hand on a folding task.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://applied-ai-lab.github.io/D-cubed/</p></details> |
| **[Generalized Consistency Trajectory Models for Image Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12510v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models excel in unconditional generation, as well as on applied tasks such as image editing and restoration. The success of diffusion models lies in the iterative nature of diffusion: diffusion breaks down the complex process of mapping noise to data into a sequence of simple denoising tasks. Moreover, we are able to exert fine-grained control over the generation process by injecting guidance terms into each denoising step. However, the iterative process is also computationally intensive, often taking from tens up to thousands of function evaluations. Although consistency trajectory models (CTMs) enable traversal between any time points along the probability flow ODE (PFODE) and score inference with a single function evaluation, CTMs only allow translation from Gaussian noise to data. Thus, this work aims to unlock the full potential of CTMs by proposing generalized CTMs (GCTMs), which translate between arbitrary distributions via ODEs. We discuss the design space of GCTMs and demonstrate their efficacy in various image manipulation tasks such as image-to-image translation, restoration, and editing.

| **[Boosting Transferability in Vision-Language Attacks via Diversification along the Intersection Region of Adversarial Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12445v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language pre-training (VLP) models exhibit remarkable capabilities in comprehending both images and text, yet they remain susceptible to multimodal adversarial examples (AEs). Strengthening adversarial attacks and uncovering vulnerabilities, especially common issues in VLP models (e.g., high transferable AEs), can stimulate further research on constructing reliable and practical VLP models. A recent work (i.e., Set-level guidance attack) indicates that augmenting image-text pairs to increase AE diversity along the optimization path enhances the transferability of adversarial examples significantly. However, this approach predominantly emphasizes diversity around the online adversarial examples (i.e., AEs in the optimization period), leading to the risk of overfitting the victim model and affecting the transferability. In this study, we posit that the diversity of adversarial examples towards the clean input and online AEs are both pivotal for enhancing transferability across VLP models. Consequently, we propose using diversification along the intersection region of adversarial trajectory to expand the diversity of AEs. To fully leverage the interaction between modalities, we introduce text-guided adversarial example selection during optimization. Furthermore, to further mitigate the potential overfitting, we direct the adversarial text deviating from the last intersection region along the optimization path, rather than adversarial images as in existing methods. Extensive experiments affirm the effectiveness of our method in improving transferability across various VLP models and downstream vision-and-language tasks (e.g., Image-Text Retrieval(ITR), Visual Grounding(VG), Image Captioning(IC)).</p></details> |  |

In the past, All-Wheel-Steering(AWS) robots, incorporating modes such as rotation-free translation maneuvers, in-situ rotational maneuvers, and proportional steering, exhibited inefficient performance due to time-consuming mode switches. This inefficiency arises from wheel rotation constraints and inter-wheel cooperation requirements. The direct application of a holonomic moving strategy can lead to significant slip angles or even structural failure. Additionally, the limited steering range of AWS wheeled robots exacerbates nonlinearity issues, thereby complicating control processes. To address these challenges, we developed a novel planning method termed Constrained AWS(C-AWS), which integrates second-order discrete search with predictive control techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that our method adeptly generates feasible and smooth trajectories for C-AWS while adhering to steering angle constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>iros ...</summary><p>iros 2024 under review</p></details> |

Model predictive path integral control is a framework that builds upon optimization principles while incorporating stochastic sampling of input trajectories. This paper investigates several sampling approaches for trajectory generation. In this context, normalizing flows originating from the field of variational inference are considered for the generation of sampling distributions, as they model transformations of simple to more complex distributions. Accordingly, learning-based normalizing flow models are trained for a more efficient exploration of the input domain for the task at hand. The developed algorithm and the proposed sampling distributions are evaluated in two simulation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published as part of the 2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), Jeju Shinhwa World, Jeju Island, Korea, June 2-5, 2024</p></details> |

However, recent studies have raised concerns regarding the hallucination and flaws in their reasoning process. Substantial efforts are being made to improve the reliability and faithfulness of the generated rationales. Some approaches model reasoning as planning, while others focus on annotating for process supervision. Nevertheless, the planning-based search process often results in high latency due to the frequent assessment of intermediate reasoning states and the extensive exploration space. Additionally, supervising the reasoning process with human annotation is costly and challenging to scale for LLM training. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a framework to learn planning-based reasoning through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on collected trajectories, which are ranked according to synthesized process rewards. Our results on challenging logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our learning framework, showing that our 7B model can surpass the strong counterparts like GPT-3.5-Turbo.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

Learning-based methods are currently showing impressive results in simulation-based challenges, with transformer-based architectures technologically leading the way. Ultimately, however, predictions are needed in the real world. In addition to the shifts from simulation to the real world, many vehicle- and country-specific shifts, i.e. differences in sensor systems, fusion and perception algorithms as well as traffic rules and laws, are on the agenda. Since models that can cover all system setups and design domains at once are not yet foreseeable, model adaptation plays a central role. Therefore, a simulation-based study on transfer learning techniques is conducted on basis of a transformer-based model. Furthermore, the study aims to provide insights into possible trade-offs between computational time and performance to support effective transfers into the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published as part of the 2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), Jeju Shinhwa World, Jeju Island, Korea, June 2-5, 2024</p></details> |

In particular, real trajectories in the wildlife domain are scarce as a result of ethical and environmental constraints of the collection process. In this paper, we consider the problem of generating long-horizon trajectories, akin to wildlife migration, based on a small set of real samples. We propose a hierarchical approach to learn the global movement characteristics of the real dataset and recursively refine localized regions. Our solution, WildGraph, discretizes the geographic path into a prototype network of H3 (https://www.uber.com/blog/h3/) regions and leverages a recurrent variational auto-encoder to probabilistically generate paths over the regions, based on occupancy. WildGraph successfully generates realistic months-long trajectories using a sample size as small as 60. Experiments performed on two wildlife migration datasets demonstrate that our proposed method improves the generalization of the generated trajectories in comparison to existing work while achieving superior or comparable performance in several benchmark metrics. Our code is published on the following repository: \url{https://github.com/aliwister/wildgraph}.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Performance of Jerk-Constrained Time-Optimal Trajectory Planning for Industrial Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07889v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Jerk-constrained trajectories offer a wide range of advantages that collectively improve the performance of robotic systems, including increased energy efficiency, durability, and safety. In this paper, we present a novel approach to jerk-constrained time-optimal trajectory planning (TOTP), which follows a specified path while satisfying up to third-order constraints to ensure safety and smooth motion. One significant challenge in jerk-constrained TOTP is a non-convex formulation arising from the inclusion of third-order constraints. Approximating inequality constraints can be particularly challenging because the resulting solutions may violate the actual constraints. We address this problem by leveraging convexity within the proposed formulation to form conservative inequality constraints. We then obtain the desired trajectories by solving an $\boldsymbol n$-dimensional Sequential Linear Program (SLP) iteratively until convergence. Lastly, we evaluate in a real robot the performance of trajectories generated with and without jerk limits in terms of peak power, torque efficiency, and tracking capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bi-level Trajectory Optimization on Uneven Terrains with Differentiable Wheel-Terrain Interaction Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03307v2)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigation of wheeled vehicles on uneven terrain necessitates going beyond the 2D approaches for trajectory planning. Specifically, it is essential to incorporate the full 6dof variation of vehicle pose and its associated stability cost in the planning process. To this end, most recent works aim to learn a neural network model to predict the vehicle evolution. However, such approaches are data-intensive and fraught with generalization issues. In this paper, we present a purely model-based approach that just requires the digital elevation information of the terrain. Specifically, we express the wheel-terrain interaction and 6dof pose prediction as a non-linear least squares (NLS) problem. As a result, trajectory planning can be viewed as a bi-level optimization. The inner optimization layer predicts the pose on the terrain along a given trajectory, while the outer layer deforms the trajectory itself to reduce the stability and kinematic costs of the pose. We improve the state-of-the-art in the following respects. First, we show that our NLS based pose prediction closely matches the output from a high-fidelity physics engine. This result coupled with the fact that we can query gradients of the NLS solver, makes our pose predictor, a differentiable wheel-terrain interaction model. We further leverage this differentiability to efficiently solve the proposed bi-level trajectory optimization problem. Finally, we perform extensive experiments, and comparison with a baseline to showcase the effectiveness of our approach in obtaining smooth, stable trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024)</p></details> |

| **[VeTraSS: Vehicle Trajectory Similarity Search Through Graph Modeling and Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08021v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory similarity search plays an essential role in autonomous driving, as it enables vehicles to analyze the information and characteristics of different trajectories to make informed decisions and navigate safely in dynamic environments. Existing work on the trajectory similarity search task primarily utilizes sequence-processing algorithms or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which suffer from the inevitable issues of complicated architecture and heavy training costs. Considering the intricate connections between trajectories, using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for data modeling is feasible. However, most methods directly use existing mathematical graph structures as the input instead of constructing specific graphs from certain vehicle trajectory data. This ignores such data's unique and dynamic characteristics. To bridge such a research gap, we propose VeTraSS -- an end-to-end pipeline for Vehicle Trajectory Similarity Search. Specifically, VeTraSS models the original trajectory data into multi-scale graphs, and generates comprehensive embeddings through a novel multi-layer attention-based GNN. The learned embeddings can be used for searching similar vehicle trajectories. Extensive experiments on the Porto and Geolife datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VeTraSS, where our model outperforms existing work and reaches the state-of-the-art. This demonstrates the potential of VeTraSS for trajectory analysis and safe navigation in self-driving vehicles in the real world.</p></details> |  |
| **[HPNet: Dynamic Trajectory Forecasting with Historical Prediction Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06351v2)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the trajectories of road agents is essential for autonomous driving systems. The recent mainstream methods follow a static paradigm, which predicts the future trajectory by using a fixed duration of historical frames. These methods make the predictions independently even at adjacent time steps, which leads to potential instability and temporal inconsistency. As successive time steps have largely overlapping historical frames, their forecasting should have intrinsic correlation, such as overlapping predicted trajectories should be consistent, or be different but share the same motion goal depending on the road situation. Motivated by this, in this work, we introduce HPNet, a novel dynamic trajectory forecasting method. Aiming for stable and accurate trajectory forecasting, our method leverages not only historical frames including maps and agent states, but also historical predictions. Specifically, we newly design a Historical Prediction Attention module to automatically encode the dynamic relationship between successive predictions. Besides, it also extends the attention range beyond the currently visible window benefitting from the use of historical predictions. The proposed Historical Prediction Attention together with the Agent Attention and Mode Attention is further formulated as the Triple Factorized Attention module, serving as the core design of HPNet.Experiments on the Argoverse and INTERACTION datasets show that HPNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, and generates accurate and stable future trajectories.

However, existing representations for motion, such as deformation models or time-dependent neural representations, are limited in the amount of motion they can generate-they cannot synthesize motion extending far beyond the bounding box used for volume rendering. The lack of a more flexible motion model contributes to the gap in realism between 4D generation methods and recent, near-photorealistic video generation models. Here, we propose TC4D: trajectory-conditioned text-to-4D generation, which factors motion into global and local components. We represent the global motion of a scene's bounding box using rigid transformation along a trajectory parameterized by a spline. We learn local deformations that conform to the global trajectory using supervision from a text-to-video model. Our approach enables the synthesis of scenes animated along arbitrary trajectories, compositional scene generation, and significant improvements to the realism and amount of generated motion, which we evaluate qualitatively and through a user study.

Here we test a diffusion probabilistic model on a specific dataset of corrupted images corresponding to incomplete Euclidean distance matrices of fBm at various memory exponents $H$. Our dataset implies uniqueness of the data imputation in the regime of low missing ratio, where the remaining partial graph is rigid, providing the ground truth for the inpainting. We find that the conditional diffusion generation stably reproduces the statistics of missing fBm-distributed distances for different values of $H$ exponent. Furthermore, while diffusion models have been recently shown to remember samples from the training database, we show that diffusion-based inpainting behaves qualitatively different from the database search with the increasing database size.

| **[Trajectory-Oriented Policy Optimization with Sparse Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02225v3)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mastering deep reinforcement learning (DRL) proves challenging in tasks featuring scant rewards. These limited rewards merely signify whether the task is partially or entirely accomplished, necessitating various exploration actions before the agent garners meaningful feedback. Consequently, the majority of existing DRL exploration algorithms struggle to acquire practical policies within a reasonable timeframe. To address this challenge, we introduce an approach leveraging offline demonstration trajectories for swifter and more efficient online RL in environments with sparse rewards. Our pivotal insight involves treating offline demonstration trajectories as guidance, rather than mere imitation, allowing our method to learn a policy whose distribution of state-action visitation marginally matches that of offline demonstrations. We specifically introduce a novel trajectory distance relying on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) and cast policy optimization as a distance-constrained optimization problem. We then illustrate that this optimization problem can be streamlined into a policy-gradient algorithm, integrating rewards shaped by insights from offline demonstrations. The proposed algorithm undergoes evaluation across extensive discrete and continuous control tasks with sparse and misleading rewards. The experimental findings demonstrate the significant superiority of our proposed algorithm over baseline methods concerning diverse exploration and the acquisition of an optimal policy.</p></details> | 6 pages, 7 figures |
| **[TrajPRed: Trajectory Prediction with Region-based Relation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06971v1)** | 2024-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting human trajectories in traffic scenes is critical for safety within mixed or fully autonomous systems. Human future trajectories are driven by two major stimuli, social interactions, and stochastic goals. Thus, reliable forecasting needs to capture these two stimuli. Edge-based relation modeling represents social interactions using pairwise correlations from precise individual states. Nevertheless, edge-based relations can be vulnerable under perturbations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a region-based relation learning paradigm that models social interactions via region-wise dynamics of joint states, i.e., the changes in the density of crowds. In particular, region-wise agent joint information is encoded within convolutional feature grids. Social relations are modeled by relating the temporal changes of local joint information from a global perspective. We show that region-based relations are less susceptible to perturbations. In order to account for the stochastic individual goals, we exploit a conditional variational autoencoder to realize multi-goal estimation and diverse future prediction. Specifically, we perform variational inference via the latent distribution, which is conditioned on the correlation between input states and associated target goals. Sampling from the latent distribution enables the framework to reliably capture the stochastic behavior in test data. We integrate multi-goal estimation and region-based relation learning to model the two stimuli, social interactions, and stochastic goals, in a prediction framework. We evaluate our framework on the ETH-UCY dataset and Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD). We show that the diverse prediction better fits the ground truth when incorporating the relation module. Our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art models on SDD by $27.61\%$/$18.20\%$ of ADE/FDE metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRANP: A Graph Recurrent Attentive Neural Process Model for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08004v1)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a vital component in autonomous driving, accurate trajectory prediction effectively prevents traffic accidents and improves driving efficiency. To capture complex spatial-temporal dynamics and social interactions, recent studies developed models based on advanced deep-learning methods. On the other hand, recent studies have explored the use of deep generative models to further account for trajectory uncertainties. However, the current approaches demonstrating indeterminacy involve inefficient and time-consuming practices such as sampling from trained models. To fill this gap, we proposed a novel model named Graph Recurrent Attentive Neural Process (GRANP) for vehicle trajectory prediction while efficiently quantifying prediction uncertainty. In particular, GRANP contains an encoder with deterministic and latent paths, and a decoder for prediction. The encoder, including stacked Graph Attention Networks, LSTM and 1D convolutional layers, is employed to extract spatial-temporal relationships. The decoder is used to learn a latent distribution and thus quantify prediction uncertainty. To reveal the effectiveness of our model, we evaluate the performance of GRANP on the highD dataset. Extensive experiments show that GRANP achieves state-of-the-art results and can efficiently quantify uncertainties. Additionally, we undertake an intuitive case study that showcases the interpretability of the proposed approach. The code is available at https://github.com/joy-driven/GRANP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deadlock Resolution and Recursive Feasibility in MPC-based Multi-robot Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06071v4)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online collision-free trajectory generation within a shared workspace is fundamental for most multi-robot applications. However, many widely-used methods based on model predictive control (MPC) lack theoretical guarantees on the feasibility of underlying optimization. Furthermore, when applied in a distributed manner without a central coordinator, deadlocks often occur where several robots block each other indefinitely. Whereas heuristic methods such as introducing random perturbations exist, no profound analyses are given to validate these measures. Towards this end, we propose a systematic method called infinite-horizon model predictive control with deadlock resolution. The MPC is formulated as a convex optimization over the proposed modified buffered Voronoi with warning band. Based on this formulation, the condition of deadlocks is formally analyzed and proven to be analogous to a force equilibrium. A detection-resolution scheme is proposed, which can effectively detect deadlocks online before they even happen. Once detected, it utilizes an adaptive resolution scheme to resolve deadlocks, under which no stable deadlocks can exist under minor conditions. In addition, the proposed planning algorithm ensures recursive feasibility of the underlying optimization at each time step under both input and model constraints, is concurrent for all robots and requires only local communication. Comprehensive simulation and experiment studies are conducted over large-scale multi-robot systems. Significant improvements on success rate are reported, in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods and especially in crowded and high-speed scenarios.</p></details> | 16 pages, 15 figures |

Typically, this issue is addressed by providing low-level per-frame guidance in the form of edge maps, depth maps, or an existing video to be altered. However, the process of obtaining such guidance can be labor-intensive. This paper focuses on enhancing controllability in video synthesis by employing straightforward bounding boxes to guide the subject in various ways, all without the need for neural network training, finetuning, optimization at inference time, or the use of pre-existing videos. Our algorithm, TrailBlazer, is constructed upon a pre-trained (T2V) model, and easy to implement. The subject is directed by a bounding box through the proposed spatial and temporal attention map editing. Moreover, we introduce the concept of keyframing, allowing the subject trajectory and overall appearance to be guided by both a moving bounding box and corresponding prompts, without the need to provide a detailed mask. The method is efficient, with negligible additional computation relative to the underlying pre-trained model. Despite the simplicity of the bounding box guidance, the resulting motion is surprisingly natural, with emergent effects including perspective and movement toward the virtual camera as the box size increases.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 18 figures, Project Page: https://hohonu-vicml.github.io/Trailblazer.Page/</p></details> |

This iterative change can be naturally interpreted as a trajectory in network space -- a time series of networks -- and thus the training algorithm (e.g. gradient descent optimization of a suitable loss function) can be interpreted as a dynamical system in graph space. In order to illustrate this interpretation, here we study the dynamical properties of this process by analyzing through this lens the network trajectories of a shallow neural network, and its evolution through learning a simple classification task. We systematically consider different ranges of the learning rate and explore both the dynamical and orbital stability of the resulting network trajectories, finding hints of regular and chaotic behavior depending on the learning rate regime. Our findings are put in contrast to common wisdom on convergence properties of neural networks and dynamical systems theory. This work also contributes to the cross-fertilization of ideas between dynamical systems theory, network theory and machine learning</p></details> | 29 pages, 18 figures |
| **[Design and Simulation of Time-energy Optimal Anti-swing Trajectory Planner for Autonomous Tower Cranes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05581v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For autonomous crane lifting, optimal trajectories of the crane are required as reference inputs to the crane controller to facilitate feedforward control. Reducing the unactuated payload motion is a crucial issue for under-actuated tower cranes with spherical pendulum dynamics. The planned trajectory should be optimal in terms of both operating time and energy consumption, to facilitate optimum output spending optimum effort. This article proposes an anti-swing tower crane trajectory planner that can provide time-energy optimal solutions for the Computer-Aided Lift Planning (CALP) system developed at Nanyang Technological University, which facilitates collision-free lifting path planning of robotized tower cranes in autonomous construction sites. The current work introduces a trajectory planning module to the system that utilizes the geometric outputs from the path planning module and optimally scales them with time information. Firstly, analyzing the non-linear dynamics of the crane operations, the tower crane is established as differentially flat. Subsequently, the multi-objective trajectory optimization problems for all the crane operations are formulated in the flat output space through consideration of the mechanical and safety constraints. Two multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, namely Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) and Generalized Differential Evolution 3 (GDE3), are extensively compared via statistical measures based on the closeness of solutions to the Pareto front, distribution of solutions in the solution space and the runtime, to select the optimization engine of the planner. Finally, the crane operation trajectories are obtained via the corresponding planned flat output trajectories. Studies simulating real-world lifting scenarios are conducted to verify the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed module of the lift planning system.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 12 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

The current auto-bidding algorithms typically employ reinforcement learning (RL). However, due to safety concerns, most RL-based auto-bidding policies are trained in simulation, leading to a performance degradation when deployed in online environments. To narrow this gap, we can deploy multiple auto-bidding agents in parallel to collect a large interaction dataset. Offline RL algorithms can then be utilized to train a new policy. The trained policy can subsequently be deployed for further data collection, resulting in an iterative training framework, which we refer to as iterative offline RL. In this work, we identify the performance bottleneck of this iterative offline RL framework, which originates from the ineffective exploration and exploitation caused by the inherent conservatism of offline RL algorithms. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose Trajectory-wise Exploration and Exploitation (TEE), which introduces a novel data collecting and data utilization method for iterative offline RL from a trajectory perspective. Furthermore, to ensure the safety of online exploration while preserving the dataset quality for TEE, we propose Safe Exploration by Adaptive Action Selection (SEAS). Both offline experiments and real-world experiments on Alibaba display advertising platform demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Web Conference 2024 (WWW'24) as an oral paper</p></details> |
| **[Collision-Free Trajectory Optimization in Cluttered Environments with Sums-of-Squares Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05242v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a trajectory optimization approach for robot navigation in cluttered 3D environments. We represent the robot's geometry as a semialgebraic set defined by polynomial inequalities such that robots with general shapes can be suitably characterized. To address the robot navigation task in obstacle-dense environments, we exploit the free space directly to construct a sequence of free regions, and allocate each waypoint on the trajectory to a specific region. Then, we incorporate a uniform scaling factor for each free region, and formulate a Sums-of-Squares (SOS) optimization problem that renders the containment relationship between the robot and the free space computationally tractable. The SOS optimization problem is further reformulated to a semidefinite program (SDP), and the collision-free constraints are shown to be equivalent to limiting the scaling factor along the entire trajectory. In this context, the robot at a specific configuration is tailored to stay within the free region. Next, to solve the trajectory optimization problem with the proposed safety constraints (which are implicitly dependent on the robot configurations), we derive the analytical solution to the gradient of the minimum scaling factor with respect to the robot configuration. As a result, this seamlessly facilitates the use of gradient-based methods in efficient solving of the trajectory optimization problem. Through a series of simulations and real-world experiments, the proposed trajectory optimization approach is validated in various challenging scenarios, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in generating collision-free trajectories in dense and intricate environments populated with obstacles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-agent Long-term 3D Human Pose Forecasting via Interaction-aware Trajectory Conditioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05218v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose forecasting garners attention for its diverse applications. However, challenges in modeling the multi-modal nature of human motion and intricate interactions among agents persist, particularly with longer timescales and more agents. In this paper, we propose an interaction-aware trajectory-conditioned long-term multi-agent human pose forecasting model, utilizing a coarse-to-fine prediction approach: multi-modal global trajectories are initially forecasted, followed by respective local pose forecasts conditioned on each mode. In doing so, our Trajectory2Pose model introduces a graph-based agent-wise interaction module for a reciprocal forecast of local motion-conditioned global trajectory and trajectory-conditioned local pose. Our model effectively handles the multi-modality of human motion and the complexity of long-term multi-agent interactions, improving performance in complex environments. Furthermore, we address the lack of long-term (6s+) multi-agent (5+) datasets by constructing a new dataset from real-world images and 2D annotations, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of our proposed model. State-of-the-art prediction performance on both complex and simpler datasets confirms the generalized effectiveness of our method.

LfO can facilitate robot integration on factory floors by minimizing disruption and reducing tedious programming. A key component of the LfO pipeline is a transformation of the depth camera frames to the corresponding task state and action pairs, which are then relayed to learning techniques such as imitation or inverse reinforcement learning for understanding the task parameters. While several existing computer vision models analyze videos for activity recognition, SA-Net specifically targets robotic LfO from RGB-D data. However, SA-Net and many other models analyze frame data captured from a single viewpoint. Their analysis is therefore highly sensitive to occlusions of the observed task, which are frequent in deployments. An obvious way of reducing occlusions is to simultaneously observe the task from multiple viewpoints and synchronously fuse the multiple streams in the model. Toward this, we present multi-view SA-Net, which generalizes the SA-Net model to allow the perception of multiple viewpoints of the task activity, integrate them, and better recognize the state and action in each frame. Performance evaluations on two distinct domains establish that MVSA-Net recognizes the state-action pairs under occlusion more accurately compared to single-view MVSA-Net and other baselines. Our ablation studies further evaluate its performance under different ambient conditions and establish the contribution of the architecture components. As such, MVSA-Net offers a significantly more robust and deployable state-action trajectory generation compared to previous methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at Deployable AI Workshop at AAAI-2024 and 'Towards Reliable and Deployable Learning-Based Robotic Systems' Workshop at CoRL2023</p></details> |

In this regard, a common shortcoming of current benchmark datasets is their limitation to sets of sample trajectories and a lack of actual ground truth distributions, which prevents the use of more expressive error metrics, such as the Wasserstein distance for model evaluation. Towards this end, this paper proposes a novel approach to synthetic dataset generation based on composite probabilistic B\'ezier curves, which is capable of generating ground truth data in terms of probability distributions over full trajectories. This allows the calculation of arbitrary posterior distributions. The paper showcases an exemplary trajectory prediction model evaluation using generated ground truth distribution data.</p></details> |  |

The evaluation is conducted on the widely-used ETH/UCY dataset where the Average Displacement Error (ADE) and the Final Displacement Error (FDE) are reported. Alongside this, we perform an ablation study to investigate the impact of the observed motion history on prediction performance. To evaluate the scalability of each approach when confronted with varying amounts of agents, the inference time of each model is measured. Following a quantitative analysis, the resulting predictions are compared in a qualitative manner, giving insight into the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches. The results demonstrate that although a constant velocity model (CVM) provides a good approximation of the overall dynamics in the majority of cases, additional features need to be incorporated to reflect common pedestrian behavior observed. Therefore, this study presents a data-driven analysis with the intent to guide the future development of pedestrian trajectory prediction algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS); 11 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

To address this, we propose a novel trajectory prediction framework called Partial Observations Prediction (POP) for congested urban road scenarios. The framework consists of two key stages: self-supervised learning (SSL) and feature distillation. POP first employs SLL to help the model learn to reconstruct history representations, and then utilizes feature distillation as the fine-tuning task to transfer knowledge from the teacher model, which has been pre-trained with complete observations, to the student model, which has only few observations. POP achieves comparable results to top-performing methods in open-loop experiments and outperforms the baseline method in closed-loop simulations, including safety metrics. Qualitative results illustrate the superiority of POP in providing reasonable and safe trajectory predictions.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, introducing neural networks into the KF framework offers a data-driven solution to compensate for these inaccuracies, improving the filter's performance while maintaining interpretability. Nevertheless, existing studies mostly employ recurrent neural network (RNN), which fails to fully capture the dependencies among state sequences and lead to an unstable training process. In this paper, we propose a novel Kalman filtering algorithm named the attention Kalman filter (AtKF), which incorporates a self-attention network to capture the dependencies among state sequences. To address the instability in the recursive training process, a parallel pre-training strategy is devised. Specifically, this strategy involves piecewise linearizing the system via lattice trajectory piecewise linear (LTPWL) expression, and generating pre-training data through a batch estimation algorithm, which exploits the self-attention mechanism's parallel processing ability. Experimental results on a two-dimensional nonlinear system demonstrate that AtKF outperforms other filters under noise disturbances and model mismatches.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

In the context of an asteroid deflection mission, accurately predicting deflection is crucial to determining the spacecraft's trajectory that will produce the desired outcome. However, the dynamics involved are intricate, and simplistic models may not fully capture the system's complexity. This study assesses the precision and limitations of analytical models in predicting deflection, comparing them to more accurate numerical simulations. The findings reveal that encounters with perturbing bodies, even at significant distances (a dozen times the radii of the sphere of influence of the perturbing planet), can markedly disturb the deflected asteroid's trajectory, resulting in notable disparities between analytical and numerical predictions. The underlying reasons for this phenomenon are explained, and provisional general guidelines are provided to assist mission analysts in addressing such occurrences. By comprehending the impact of shallow encounters on deflection, this study equips designers with the knowledge to make informed decisions throughout the trajectory planning process, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of asteroid deflection missions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the AIAA's Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics.

In contrast to the prevalent practice of validating RL models based on their optimal behavior learned during training, we posit that considering a range of edge-case trajectories provides a more comprehensive understanding of their inherent behavior. To induce such scenarios, we introduce a disturbance to the initial state, optimizing it through an evolutionary algorithm to generate a diverse population of demonstrations. To evaluate the fitness of trajectories, REACT incorporates a joint fitness function that encourages both local and global diversity in the encountered states and chosen actions. Through assessments with policies trained for varying durations in discrete and continuous environments, we demonstrate the descriptive power of REACT. Our results highlight its effectiveness in revealing nuanced aspects of RL models' behavior beyond optimal performance, thereby contributing to improved interpretability.</p></details> | 12 pages, 12 figures |

However, current systems fall short of matching human-level of intelligence in terms of adapting to novel tools. Prior works based on affordance often make strong assumptions about the environments and cannot scale to more complex, contact-rich tasks. In this work, we tackle this challenge and explore how agents can learn to use previously unseen tools to manipulate deformable objects. We propose to learn a generative model of the tool-use trajectories as a sequence of tool point clouds, which generalizes to different tool shapes. Given any novel tool, we first generate a tool-use trajectory and then optimize the sequence of tool poses to align with the generated trajectory. We train a single model on four different challenging deformable object manipulation tasks, using demonstration data from only one tool per task. The model generalizes to various novel tools, significantly outperforming baselines. We further test our trained policy in the real world with unseen tools, where it achieves the performance comparable to human.

Such tasks are designed to assess whether novices have developed the analytical skills to translate from the given problem domain to coding. In the past researchers have used instruments such as code-explain and found that the extent of cognitive depth reached in these tasks correlated well with code writing ability. However, the need for manual marking and personalized interviews used for identifying cognitive difficulties limited the study to a small group of stragglers. To extend this work to larger groups, we have devised several question types with varying cognitive demands collectively called Algorithmic Reasoning Tasks (ARTs), which do not require manual marking. These tasks require levels of reasoning which can define a learning trajectory. This paper describes these instruments and the machine learning models used for validating them. We have used the data collected in an introductory programming course in the penultimate week of the semester which required attempting ART type instruments and code writing. Our preliminary research suggests ART type instruments can be combined with specific machine learning models to act as an effective learning trajectory and early prediction of code-writing skills.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Existing approaches in this field often assume precise and complete observational data, neglecting the challenges associated with out-of-view objects and the noise inherent in sensor data due to limited camera range, physical obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised sensor data. Such oversights are critical safety concerns, as they can result in missing essential, non-visible objects. To bridge this gap, we present a novel method for out-of-sight trajectory prediction that leverages a vision-positioning technique. Our approach denoises noisy sensor observations in an unsupervised manner and precisely maps sensor-based trajectories of out-of-sight objects into visual trajectories. This method has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in out-of-sight noisy sensor trajectory denoising and prediction on the Vi-Fi and JRDB datasets. By enhancing trajectory prediction accuracy and addressing the challenges of out-of-sight objects, our work significantly contributes to improving the safety and reliability of autonomous driving in complex environments.

However, the lack of sensors often results in incomplete traffic state data, making it challenging to obtain reliable information for decision-making. This paper proposes a novel method for imputing traffic state data using Gaussian processes (GP) to address this issue. We propose a kernel rotation re-parametrization scheme that transforms a standard isotropic GP kernel into an anisotropic kernel, which can better model the congestion propagation in traffic flow data. The model parameters can be estimated by statistical inference using data from sparse probe vehicles or loop detectors. Moreover, the rotated GP method provides statistical uncertainty quantification for the imputed traffic state, making it more reliable. We also extend our approach to a multi-output GP, which allows for simultaneously estimating the traffic state for multiple lanes. We evaluate our method using real-world traffic data from the Next Generation simulation (NGSIM) and HighD programs, along with simulated data representing a traffic bottleneck scenario. Considering current and future mixed traffic of connected vehicles (CVs) and human-driven vehicles (HVs), we experiment with the traffic state estimation (TSE) scheme from 5% to 50% available trajectories, mimicking different CV penetration rates in a mixed traffic environment. We also test the traffic state estimation when traffic flow information is obtained from loop detectors. The results demonstrate the adaptability of our TSE method across different CV penetration rates and types of detectors, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in scenarios with sparse observation rates.</p></details> |  |

We propose two prior attention modules, namely Kinematics Prior Attention (KPA) and Trajectory Prior Attention (TPA) to take advantage of the known anatomical structure of the human body and motion trajectory information, to facilitate effective learning of global dependencies and features in the multi-head self-attention. KPA models kinematic relationships in the human body by constructing a topology of kinematics, while TPA builds a trajectory topology to learn the information of joint motion trajectory across frames. Yielding Q, K, V vectors with prior knowledge, the two modules enable KTPFormer to model both spatial and temporal correlations simultaneously. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks (Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP and HumanEva) show that KTPFormer achieves superior performance in comparison to state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, our KPA and TPA modules have lightweight plug-and-play designs and can be integrated into various transformer-based networks (i.e., diffusion-based) to improve the performance with only a very small increase in the computational overhead.

While many existing studies have proposed different methods to estimate unknown traffic states and parameters (e.g., penetration rate, queue length) with this data, most of them only provide a point estimation without knowing the uncertainty of these estimated values. It is important to quantify the estimation uncertainty caused by limited available data since it can explicitly inform us whether the available data is sufficient to satisfy the desired estimation accuracy. To fill this gap, we formulate the partially observable system as a hidden Markov model (HMM) based on the recently developed probabilistic time-space (PTS) model. The PTS model is a stochastic traffic flow model that is designed for modeling traffic flow dynamics near signalized intersections. Based on the HMM formulation, a single recursive program is developed for the Bayesian estimation of both traffic states and parameters. As a Bayesian approach, the proposed method provides the distributional estimation outcomes and directly quantifies the estimation uncertainty. We validate the proposed method with simulation studies and showcase its applicability to real-world vehicle trajectory data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Perfecting Periodic Trajectory Tracking: Model Predictive Control with a Periodic Observer ($Π$-MPC)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01550v1)** | 2024-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Model Predictive Control (MPC), discrepancies between the actual system and the predictive model can lead to substantial tracking errors and significantly degrade performance and reliability. While such discrepancies can be alleviated with more complex models, this often complicates controller design and implementation. By leveraging the fact that many trajectories of interest are periodic, we show that perfect tracking is possible when incorporating a simple observer that estimates and compensates for periodic disturbances. We present the design of the observer and the accompanying tracking MPC scheme, proving that their combination achieves zero tracking error asymptotically, regardless of the complexity of the unmodelled dynamics. We validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating asymptotically perfect tracking on a high-dimensional soft robot with nearly 10,000 states and a fivefold reduction in tracking errors compared to a baseline MPC on small-scale autonomous race car experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, Submitted to the 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024)</p></details> |

By leveraging the regional/local characteristics of the flow field captured by streamlines or pathlines, our methodology aims to enhance the accuracy of vortex boundary extraction.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[An Integrating Comprehensive Trajectory Prediction with Risk Potential Field Method for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00893v1)** | 2024-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the uncertainty of traffic participants' intentions, generating safe but not overly cautious behavior in interactive driving scenarios remains a formidable challenge for autonomous driving. In this paper, we address this issue by combining a deep learning-based trajectory prediction model with risk potential field-based motion planning. In order to comprehensively predict the possible future trajectories of other vehicles, we propose a target-region based trajectory prediction model(TRTP) which considers every region a vehicle may arrive in the future. After that, we construct a risk potential field at each future time step based on the prediction results of TRTP, and integrate risk value to the objective function of Model Predictive Contouring Control(MPCC). This enables the uncertainty of other vehicles to be taken into account during the planning process. Balancing between risk and progress along the reference path can achieve both driving safety and efficiency at the same time. We also demonstrate the security and effectiveness performance of our method in the CARLA simulator.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adapting to Length Shift: FlexiLength Network for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00742v1)** | 2024-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction plays an important role in various applications, including autonomous driving, robotics, and scene understanding. Existing approaches mainly focus on developing compact neural networks to increase prediction precision on public datasets, typically employing a standardized input duration. However, a notable issue arises when these models are evaluated with varying observation lengths, leading to a significant performance drop, a phenomenon we term the Observation Length Shift. To address this issue, we introduce a general and effective framework, the FlexiLength Network (FLN), to enhance the robustness of existing trajectory prediction techniques against varying observation periods. Specifically, FLN integrates trajectory data with diverse observation lengths, incorporates FlexiLength Calibration (FLC) to acquire temporal invariant representations, and employs FlexiLength Adaptation (FLA) to further refine these representations for more accurate future trajectory predictions. Comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets, ie, ETH/UCY, nuScenes, and Argoverse 1, demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our proposed FLN framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024</p></details> |

To address this limitation, we propose Consistency Trajectory Model (CTM), a generalization encompassing CM and score-based models as special cases. CTM trains a single neural network that can -- in a single forward pass -- output scores (i.e., gradients of log-density) and enables unrestricted traversal between any initial and final time along the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in a diffusion process. CTM enables the efficient combination of adversarial training and denoising score matching loss to enhance performance and achieves new state-of-the-art FIDs for single-step diffusion model sampling on CIFAR-10 (FID 1.73) and ImageNet at 64x64 resolution (FID 1.92). CTM also enables a new family of sampling schemes, both deterministic and stochastic, involving long jumps along the ODE solution trajectories. It consistently improves sample quality as computational budgets increase, avoiding the degradation seen in CM. Furthermore, unlike CM, CTM's access to the score function can streamline the adoption of established controllable/conditional generation methods from the diffusion community. This access also enables the computation of likelihood.

Such a robot needs to be able to predict the ego motion of the wearer based on egocentric vision and the surrounding scene. In this work, we leveraged body-mounted cameras and sensors to anticipate the trajectory of human wearers through complex surroundings. To facilitate research in ego-motion prediction, we have collected a comprehensive walking scene navigation dataset centered on the user's perspective. We present a method to predict human motion conditioning on the surrounding static scene. Our method leverages a diffusion model to produce a distribution of potential future trajectories, taking into account the user's observation of the environment. We introduce a compact representation to encode the user's visual memory of the surroundings, as well as an efficient sample-generating technique to speed up real-time inference of a diffusion model. We ablate our model and compare it to baselines, and results show that our model outperforms existing methods on key metrics of collision avoidance and trajectory mode coverage.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Joint Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction through Posterior Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00237v1)** | 2024-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint pedestrian trajectory prediction has long grappled with the inherent unpredictability of human behaviors. Recent investigations employing variants of conditional diffusion models in trajectory prediction have exhibited notable success. Nevertheless, the heavy dependence on accurate historical data results in their vulnerability to noise disturbances and data incompleteness. To improve the robustness and reliability, we introduce the Guided Full Trajectory Diffuser (GFTD), a novel diffusion model framework that captures the joint full (historical and future) trajectory distribution. By learning from the full trajectory, GFTD can recover the noisy and missing data, hence improving the robustness. In addition, GFTD can adapt to data imperfections without additional training requirements, leveraging posterior sampling for reliable prediction and controllable generation. Our approach not only simplifies the prediction process but also enhances generalizability in scenarios with noise and incomplete inputs. Through rigorous experimental evaluation, GFTD exhibits superior performance in both trajectory prediction and controllable generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[SURESTEP: An Uncertainty-Aware Trajectory Optimization Framework to Enhance Visual Tool Tracking for Robust Surgical Automation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00123v1)** | 2024-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inaccurate tool localization is one of the main reasons for failures in automating surgical tasks. Imprecise robot kinematics and noisy observations caused by the poor visual acuity of an endoscopic camera make tool tracking challenging. Previous works in surgical automation adopt environment-specific setups or hard-coded strategies instead of explicitly considering motion and observation uncertainty of tool tracking in their policies. In this work, we present SURESTEP, an uncertainty-aware trajectory optimization framework for robust surgical automation. We model the uncertainty of tool tracking with the components motivated by the sources of noise in typical surgical scenes. Using a Gaussian assumption to propagate our uncertainty models through a given tool trajectory, SURESTEP provides a general framework that minimizes the upper bound on the entropy of the final estimated tool distribution. We compare SURESTEP with a baseline method on a real-world suture needle regrasping task under challenging environmental conditions, such as poor lighting and a moving endoscopic camera. The results over 60 regrasps on the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) demonstrate that our optimized trajectories significantly outperform the un-optimized baseline.</p></details> |  |

A new nonlinear adaptive learning controller that is low-cost and portable to different wheelbase sizes is proposed to adapt to large-angle maneuvers and load changes in UAV delivery missions. The controller consists of a nonlinear variable gain (NLVG) function and an extreme value search (ES) algorithm to reduce overshoot and settling time. Finally, simulations were conducted on a quadcopter to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme under two typical collision-free trajectories.</p></details> |  |
| **[SingularTrajectory: Universal Trajectory Predictor Using Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18452v1)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are five types of trajectory prediction tasks: deterministic, stochastic, domain adaptation, momentary observation, and few-shot. These associated tasks are defined by various factors, such as the length of input paths, data split and pre-processing methods. Interestingly, even though they commonly take sequential coordinates of observations as input and infer future paths in the same coordinates as output, designing specialized architectures for each task is still necessary. For the other task, generality issues can lead to sub-optimal performances. In this paper, we propose SingularTrajectory, a diffusion-based universal trajectory prediction framework to reduce the performance gap across the five tasks. The core of SingularTrajectory is to unify a variety of human dynamics representations on the associated tasks. To do this, we first build a Singular space to project all types of motion patterns from each task into one embedding space. We next propose an adaptive anchor working in the Singular space. Unlike traditional fixed anchor methods that sometimes yield unacceptable paths, our adaptive anchor enables correct anchors, which are put into a wrong location, based on a traversability map. Finally, we adopt a diffusion-based predictor to further enhance the prototype paths using a cascaded denoising process. Our unified framework ensures the generality across various benchmark settings such as input modality, and trajectory lengths. Extensive experiments on five public benchmarks demonstrate that SingularTrajectory substantially outperforms existing models, highlighting its effectiveness in estimating general dynamics of human movements.

| **[Can Language Beat Numerical Regression? Language-Based Multimodal Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18447v1)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models have demonstrated impressive ability in context understanding and generative performance. Inspired by the recent success of language foundation models, in this paper, we propose LMTraj (Language-based Multimodal Trajectory predictor), which recasts the trajectory prediction task into a sort of question-answering problem. Departing from traditional numerical regression models, which treat the trajectory coordinate sequence as continuous signals, we consider them as discrete signals like text prompts. Specially, we first transform an input space for the trajectory coordinate into the natural language space. Here, the entire time-series trajectories of pedestrians are converted into a text prompt, and scene images are described as text information through image captioning. The transformed numerical and image data are then wrapped into the question-answering template for use in a language model. Next, to guide the language model in understanding and reasoning high-level knowledge, such as scene context and social relationships between pedestrians, we introduce an auxiliary multi-task question and answering. We then train a numerical tokenizer with the prompt data. We encourage the tokenizer to separate the integer and decimal parts well, and leverage it to capture correlations between the consecutive numbers in the language model. Lastly, we train the language model using the numerical tokenizer and all of the question-answer prompts. Here, we propose a beam-search-based most-likely prediction and a temperature-based multimodal prediction to implement both deterministic and stochastic inferences. Applying our LMTraj, we show that the language-based model can be a powerful pedestrian trajectory predictor, and outperforms existing numerical-based predictor methods.

| **[UniTraj: A Unified Framework for Scalable Vehicle Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15098v2)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle trajectory prediction has increasingly relied on data-driven solutions, but their ability to scale to different data domains and the impact of larger dataset sizes on their generalization remain under-explored. While these questions can be studied by employing multiple datasets, it is challenging due to several discrepancies, e.g., in data formats, map resolution, and semantic annotation types. To address these challenges, we introduce UniTraj, a comprehensive framework that unifies various datasets, models, and evaluation criteria, presenting new opportunities for the vehicle trajectory prediction field. In particular, using UniTraj, we conduct extensive experiments and find that model performance significantly drops when transferred to other datasets. However, enlarging data size and diversity can substantially improve performance, leading to a new state-of-the-art result for the nuScenes dataset. We provide insights into dataset characteristics to explain these findings. The code can be found here: https://github.com/vita-epfl/UniTraj</p></details> |  |
| **[World Models via Policy-Guided Trajectory Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08533v4)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models are a powerful tool for developing intelligent agents. By predicting the outcome of a sequence of actions, world models enable policies to be optimised via on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) using synthetic data, i.e. in "in imagination". Existing world models are autoregressive in that they interleave predicting the next state with sampling the next action from the policy. Prediction error inevitably compounds as the trajectory length grows. In this work, we propose a novel world modelling approach that is not autoregressive and generates entire on-policy trajectories in a single pass through a diffusion model. Our approach, Policy-Guided Trajectory Diffusion (PolyGRAD), leverages a denoising model in addition to the gradient of the action distribution of the policy to diffuse a trajectory of initially random states and actions into an on-policy synthetic trajectory. We analyse the connections between PolyGRAD, score-based generative models, and classifier-guided diffusion models. Our results demonstrate that PolyGRAD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of trajectory prediction error for short trajectories, with the exception of autoregressive diffusion. For short trajectories, PolyGRAD obtains similar errors to autoregressive diffusion, but with lower computational requirements. For long trajectories, PolyGRAD obtains comparable performance to baselines. Our experiments demonstrate that PolyGRAD enables performant policies to be trained via on-policy RL in imagination for MuJoCo continuous control domains. Thus, PolyGRAD introduces a new paradigm for accurate on-policy world modelling without autoregressive sampling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in TMLR, March 2024</p></details> |

Existing motion prediction approaches have ample room for improvement, particularly in terms of long-term prediction accuracy and interpretability. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing LC-LLM, an explainable lane change prediction model that leverages the strong reasoning capabilities and self-explanation abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Essentially, we reformulate the lane change prediction task as a language modeling problem, processing heterogeneous driving scenario information in natural language as prompts for input into the LLM and employing a supervised fine-tuning technique to tailor the LLM specifically for our lane change prediction task. This allows us to utilize the LLM's powerful common sense reasoning abilities to understand complex interactive information, thereby improving the accuracy of long-term predictions. Furthermore, we incorporate explanatory requirements into the prompts in the inference stage. Therefore, our LC-LLM model not only can predict lane change intentions and trajectories but also provides explanations for its predictions, enhancing the interpretability. Extensive experiments on the large-scale highD dataset demonstrate the superior performance and interpretability of our LC-LLM in lane change prediction task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize LLMs for predicting lane change behavior. Our study shows that LLMs can encode comprehensive interaction information for driving behavior understanding.</p></details> |  |

These forecasts allow to anticipate events leading to collisions and, therefore, to mitigate them. Deep Neural Networks have excelled in motion forecasting, but issues like overconfidence and uncertainty quantification persist. Deep Ensembles address these concerns, yet applying them to multimodal distributions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Hierarchical Light Transformer Ensembles (HLT-Ens), aimed at efficiently training an ensemble of Transformer architectures using a novel hierarchical loss function. HLT-Ens leverages grouped fully connected layers, inspired by grouped convolution techniques, to capture multimodal distributions, effectively. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that HLT-Ens achieves state-of-the-art performance levels, offering a promising avenue for improving trajectory forecasting techniques.</p></details> |  |

The diversity and uncertainty in socially interactive behaviors among a rich variety of agents make this task more challenging than other deterministic computer vision tasks. Researchers have made a lot of efforts to quantify the effects of these interactions on future trajectories through different mathematical models and network structures, but this problem has not been well solved. Inspired by marine animals that localize the positions of their companions underwater through echoes, we build a new anglebased trainable social interaction representation, named SocialCircle, for continuously reflecting the context of social interactions at different angular orientations relative to the target agent. We validate the effect of the proposed SocialCircle by training it along with several newly released trajectory prediction models, and experiments show that the SocialCircle not only quantitatively improves the prediction performance, but also qualitatively helps better simulate social interactions when forecasting pedestrian trajectories in a way that is consistent with human intuitions.</p></details> | CVPR 2024 accepted |

| **[Offline Reinforcement Learning: Role of State Aggregation and Trajectory Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17091v1)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We revisit the problem of offline reinforcement learning with value function realizability but without Bellman completeness. Previous work by Xie and Jiang (2021) and Foster et al. (2022) left open the question whether a bounded concentrability coefficient along with trajectory-based offline data admits a polynomial sample complexity. In this work, we provide a negative answer to this question for the task of offline policy evaluation. In addition to addressing this question, we provide a rather complete picture for offline policy evaluation with only value function realizability. Our primary findings are threefold: 1) The sample complexity of offline policy evaluation is governed by the concentrability coefficient in an aggregated Markov Transition Model jointly determined by the function class and the offline data distribution, rather than that in the original MDP. This unifies and generalizes the ideas of Xie and Jiang (2021) and Foster et al. (2022), 2) The concentrability coefficient in the aggregated Markov Transition Model may grow exponentially with the horizon length, even when the concentrability coefficient in the original MDP is small and the offline data is admissible (i.e., the data distribution equals the occupancy measure of some policy), 3) Under value function realizability, there is a generic reduction that can convert any hard instance with admissible data to a hard instance with trajectory data, implying that trajectory data offers no extra benefits over admissible data. These three pieces jointly resolve the open problem, though each of them could be of independent interest.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization with Global Yaw Parameterization for Field-of-View Constrained Autonomous Flight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17067v1)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory generation for quadrotors with limited field-of-view sensors has numerous applications such as aerial exploration, coverage, inspection, videography, and target tracking. Most previous works simplify the task of optimizing yaw trajectories by either aligning the heading of the robot with its velocity, or potentially restricting the feasible space of candidate trajectories by using a limited yaw domain to circumvent angular singularities. In this paper, we propose a novel \textit{global} yaw parameterization method for trajectory optimization that allows a 360-degree yaw variation as demanded by the underlying algorithm. This approach effectively bypasses inherent singularities by including supplementary quadratic constraints and transforming the final decision variables into the desired state representation. This method significantly reduces the needed control effort, and improves optimization feasibility. Furthermore, we apply the method to several examples of different applications that require jointly optimizing over both the yaw and position trajectories. Ultimately, we present a comprehensive numerical analysis and evaluation of our proposed method in both simulation and real-world experiments.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this, we 1) decompose our polygonal environment into different overlapping cells 2) write out our polynomial trajectories as the output of a reference dynamical system with given initial conditions 3) formulate convergence and safety constraints as Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) on our controller using Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and 4) solve a semi-definite programming (SDP) problem with convergence and safety constraints imposed to synthesize a controller for each convex cell. Extensive simulations are included to test our motion planning method under different initial conditions and different reference trajectories. The synthesized controller is robust to changes in initial conditions and is always safe relative to the boundaries of the polygonal environment.</p></details> |  |

This paper for the first time proposes a surveillance system that utilizes low-cost magnetic sensors for detecting and tracking vehicles continuously along the road. The system uses multiple sensors mounted along the roadside and lane boundaries to capture the movement of vehicles. Real-time measurement data is collected by base stations and processed to produce vehicle trajectories that include position, timestamp, and speed. To address the challenge of tracking vehicles continuously on a road network using a large amount of unlabeled magnetic sensor measurements, we first define a vehicle trajectory tracking problem. We then propose a graph-based data association algorithm to track each detected vehicle, and design a related online algorithm framework respectively. We finally validate the performance via both experimental simulation and real-world road deployment. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution provides a cost-effective solution to capture the driving status of vehicles and on that basis form various traffic safety and efficiency applications.</p></details> |  |

As a result, many recent works have proposed methods for estimating HD maps online from sensor data, enabling AVs to operate outside of previously-mapped regions. However, current online map estimation approaches are developed in isolation of their downstream tasks, complicating their integration in AV stacks. In particular, they do not produce uncertainty or confidence estimates. In this work, we extend multiple state-of-the-art online map estimation methods to additionally estimate uncertainty and show how this enables more tightly integrating online mapping with trajectory forecasting. In doing so, we find that incorporating uncertainty yields up to 50% faster training convergence and up to 15% better prediction performance on the real-world nuScenes driving dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 14 figures, 6 tables.

| **[ProIn: Learning to Predict Trajectory Based on Progressive Interactions for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16374v1)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate motion prediction of pedestrians, cyclists, and other surrounding vehicles (all called agents) is very important for autonomous driving. Most existing works capture map information through an one-stage interaction with map by vector-based attention, to provide map constraints for social interaction and multi-modal differentiation. However, these methods have to encode all required map rules into the focal agent's feature, so as to retain all possible intentions' paths while at the meantime to adapt to potential social interaction. In this work, a progressive interaction network is proposed to enable the agent's feature to progressively focus on relevant maps, in order to better learn agents' feature representation capturing the relevant map constraints. The network progressively encode the complex influence of map constraints into the agent's feature through graph convolutions at the following three stages: after historical trajectory encoder, after social interaction, and after multi-modal differentiation. In addition, a weight allocation mechanism is proposed for multi-modal training, so that each mode can obtain learning opportunities from a single-mode ground truth. Experiments have validated the superiority of progressive interactions to the existing one-stage interaction, and demonstrate the effectiveness of each component. Encouraging results were obtained in the challenging benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we present a novel Conditional RNN(CRNN) for diffusion models to efficiently generate trajectories. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive training method that ensures that the diffusion model generates more traversable trajectories. We evaluate our methods in various outdoor scenes and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms on a Husky robot. In practice, we observe at least a 15% improvement in traveling distance and around a 7% improvement in traversability.</p></details> | 10 pages |

An accurate and robust trajectory tracking method is indispensable for these motion-related modules as a primitive routine. Current methods often make strong assumptions about the model such as the context and the dynamics, which are not robust enough to deal with the changing scenarios in a real-world system. In this paper, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based trajectory tracking method for the motion-related modules in autonomous driving systems. The representation learning ability of DL and the exploration nature of RL bring strong robustness and improve accuracy. Meanwhile, it enhances versatility by running the trajectory tracking in a model-free and data-driven manner. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate both the efficiency and effectiveness of our method compared to current methods.

Moreover, the uncertainty-aware learning procedures in probabilistic approaches lead to robust policies that are less sensitive to noisy observations compared to uncertainty unaware solutions. We propose to combine trajectory sampling and deep Gaussian covariance network (DGCN) for a data-efficient solution to MBRL problems in an optimal control setting. We compare trajectory sampling with density-based approximation for uncertainty propagation using three different probabilistic world models; Gaussian processes, Bayesian neural networks, and DGCNs. We provide empirical evidence using four different well-known test environments, that our method improves the sample-efficiency over other combinations of uncertainty propagation methods and probabilistic models. During our tests, we place particular emphasis on the robustness of the learned policies with respect to noisy initial states.</p></details> |  |

As a part of ITS, Vehicle Trajectory Prediction (VTP) aims to forecast a vehicle's future positions based on its past and current movements. VTP is a pivotal element for road safety, aiding in applications such as traffic management, accident prevention, work-zone safety, and energy optimization. While most works in this field focus on autonomous driving, with the growing number of surveillance cameras, another sub-field emerges for surveillance VTP with its own set of challenges. In this paper, we introduce VT-Former, a novel transformer-based VTP approach for highway safety and surveillance. In addition to utilizing transformers to capture long-range temporal patterns, a new Graph Attentive Tokenization (GAT) module has been proposed to capture intricate social interactions among vehicles. This study seeks to explore both the advantages and the limitations inherent in combining transformer architecture with graphs for VTP. Our investigation, conducted across three benchmark datasets from diverse surveillance viewpoints, showcases the State-of-the-Art (SotA) or comparable performance of VT-Former in predicting vehicle trajectories. This study underscores the potentials of VT-Former and its architecture, opening new avenues for future research and exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Compl...</summary><p>Completely updated based on the reviews received for the paper</p></details> |

In recent years, emerging data-driven deep learning-based methods have shown great promise for these two tasks in learning various traffic scenarios and improving average performance without assuming physical models. However, it remains a challenging problem for these methods to ensure that the generated/predicted trajectories are physically realistic. This challenge arises because learning-based approaches often function as opaque black boxes and do not adhere to physical laws. Conversely, existing model-based methods provide physically feasible results but are constrained by predefined model structures, limiting their capabilities to address complex scenarios. To address the limitations of these two types of approaches, we propose a new method that integrates kinematic knowledge into neural stochastic differential equations (SDE) and designs a variational autoencoder based on this latent kinematics-aware SDE (LK-SDE) to generate vehicle motions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms both model-based and learning-based baselines in producing physically realistic and precisely controllable vehicle trajectories. Additionally, it performs well in predicting unobservable physical variables in the latent space.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, conference paper in motion generation</p></details> |

In this work, we address the problem of one-shot imitation from a single human demonstration, given by an RGB-D video recording through a two-stage process. In the first stage which is offline, we extract the trajectory of the demonstration. This entails segmenting manipulated objects and determining their relative motion in relation to secondary objects such as containers. Subsequently, in the live online trajectory generation stage, we first \mbox{re-detect} all objects, then we warp the demonstration trajectory to the current scene, and finally, we trace the trajectory with the robot. To complete these steps, our method makes leverages several ancillary models, including those for segmentation, relative object pose estimation, and grasp prediction. We systematically evaluate different combinations of correspondence and re-detection methods to validate our design decision across a diverse range of tasks. Specifically, we collect demonstrations of ten different tasks including pick-and-place tasks as well as articulated object manipulation. Finally, we perform extensive evaluations on a real robot system to demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of our approach in real-world scenarios.

| **[Trajectory Regularization Enhances Self-Supervised Geometric Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14973v1)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has proven effective in learning high-quality representations for various downstream tasks, with a primary focus on semantic tasks. However, its application in geometric tasks remains underexplored, partially due to the absence of a standardized evaluation method for geometric representations. To address this gap, we introduce a new pose-estimation benchmark for assessing SSL geometric representations, which demands training without semantic or pose labels and achieving proficiency in both semantic and geometric downstream tasks. On this benchmark, we study enhancing SSL geometric representations without sacrificing semantic classification accuracy. We find that leveraging mid-layer representations improves pose-estimation performance by 10-20%. Further, we introduce an unsupervised trajectory-regularization loss, which improves performance by an additional 4% and improves generalization ability on out-of-distribution data. We hope the proposed benchmark and methods offer new insights and improvements in self-supervised geometric representation learning.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods, focusing on simplistic spatio-temporal features, face challenges of complex calculations, limited scalability, and inadequate adaptability to real-world complexities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the development and recent advances in deep learning for trajectory computing (DL4Traj). We first define trajectory data and provide a brief overview of widely-used deep learning models. Systematically, we explore deep learning applications in trajectory management (pre-processing, storage, analysis, and visualization) and mining (trajectory-related forecasting, trajectory-related recommendation, trajectory classification, travel time estimation, anomaly detection, and mobility generation).

| **[A Physics Enhanced Residual Learning (PERL) Framework for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15284v2)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In vehicle trajectory prediction, physics models and data-driven models are two predominant methodologies. However, each approach presents its own set of challenges: physics models fall short in predictability, while data-driven models lack interpretability. Addressing these identified shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel framework, the Physics-Enhanced Residual Learning (PERL) model. PERL integrates the strengths of physics-based and data-driven methods for traffic state prediction. PERL contains a physics model and a residual learning model. Its prediction is the sum of the physics model result and a predicted residual as a correction to it. It preserves the interpretability inherent to physics-based models and has reduced data requirements compared to data-driven methods. Experiments were conducted using a real-world vehicle trajectory dataset. We proposed a PERL model, with the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) as its physics car-following model and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) as its residual learning model. We compare this PERL model with the physics car-following model, data-driven model, and other physics-informed neural network (PINN) models. The result reveals that PERL achieves better prediction with a small dataset, compared to the physics model, data-driven model, and PINN model. Second, the PERL model showed faster convergence during training, offering comparable performance with fewer training samples than the data-driven model and PINN model. Sensitivity analysis also proves comparable performance of PERL using another residual learning model and a physics car-following model.</p></details> |  |

While numerous strategies have been developed to enhance the robustness of trajectory prediction models, these methods are predominantly heuristic and do not offer guaranteed robustness against adversarial attacks and noisy observations. In this work, we propose a certification approach tailored for the task of trajectory prediction. To this end, we address the inherent challenges associated with trajectory prediction, including unbounded outputs, and mutli-modality, resulting in a model that provides guaranteed robustness. Furthermore, we integrate a denoiser into our method to further improve the performance. Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique across various baselines and using standard trajectory prediction datasets.

Motivated by the pivotal role trajectory length plays in the training process, we introduce Ada-NAV, a novel adaptive trajectory length scheme designed to enhance the training sample efficiency of RL algorithms in robotic navigation tasks. Unlike traditional approaches that treat trajectory length as a fixed hyperparameter, we propose to dynamically adjust it based on the entropy of the underlying navigation policy. Interestingly, Ada-NAV can be applied to both existing on-policy and off-policy RL methods, which we demonstrate by empirically validating its efficacy on three popular RL methods: REINFORCE, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). We demonstrate through simulated and real-world robotic experiments that Ada-NAV outperforms conventional methods that employ constant or randomly sampled trajectory lengths. Specifically, for a fixed sample budget, Ada-NAV achieves an 18\% increase in navigation success rate, a 20-38\% reduction in navigation path length, and a 9.32\% decrease in elevation costs. Furthermore, we showcase the versatility of Ada-NAV by integrating it with the Clearpath Husky robot, illustrating its applicability in complex outdoor environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Progressive trajectory matching for medical dataset distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13469v1)** | 2024-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is essential but challenging to share medical image datasets due to privacy issues, which prohibit building foundation models and knowledge transfer. In this paper, we propose a novel dataset distillation method to condense the original medical image datasets into a synthetic one that preserves useful information for building an analysis model without accessing the original datasets. Existing methods tackle only natural images by randomly matching parts of the training trajectories of the model parameters trained by the whole real datasets. However, through extensive experiments on medical image datasets, the training process is extremely unstable and achieves inferior distillation results. To solve these barriers, we propose to design a novel progressive trajectory matching strategy to improve the training stability for medical image dataset distillation. Additionally, it is observed that improved stability prevents the synthetic dataset diversity and final performance improvements. Therefore, we propose a dynamic overlap mitigation module that improves the synthetic dataset diversity by dynamically eliminating the overlap across different images and retraining parts of the synthetic images for better convergence. Finally, we propose a new medical image dataset distillation benchmark of various modalities and configurations to promote fair evaluations. It is validated that our proposed method achieves 8.33% improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods on average, and 11.7% improvement when ipc=2 (i.e., image per class is 2). Codes and benchmarks will be released.</p></details> |  |

With the increasing age of HF patients, elucidating the specific causes of inpatient mortality became a public health problematic. We introduce a novel methodological framework designed to identify prevalent health trajectories and investigate their impact on death. The initial step involves applying sequential pattern mining to characterize patients' trajectories, followed by an unsupervised clustering algorithm based on a new metric for measuring the distance between hospitalization diagnoses. Finally, a survival analysis is conducted to assess survival outcomes. The application of this framework to HF patients from a representative sample of the French population demonstrates its methodological significance in enhancing the analysis of healthcare trajectories.</p></details> |  |
| **[CaDRE: Controllable and Diverse Generation of Safety-Critical Driving Scenarios using Real-World Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13208v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation is an indispensable tool in the development and testing of autonomous vehicles (AVs), offering an efficient and safe alternative to road testing by allowing the exploration of a wide range of scenarios. Despite its advantages, a significant challenge within simulation-based testing is the generation of safety-critical scenarios, which are essential to ensure that AVs can handle rare but potentially fatal situations. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a novel generative framework, CaDRE, which is specifically designed for generating diverse and controllable safety-critical scenarios using real-world trajectories. Our approach optimizes for both the quality and diversity of scenarios by employing a unique formulation and algorithm that integrates real-world data, domain knowledge, and black-box optimization techniques. We validate the effectiveness of our framework through extensive testing in three representative types of traffic scenarios. The results demonstrate superior performance in generating diverse and high-quality scenarios with greater sample efficiency than existing reinforcement learning and sampling-based methods.</p></details> |  |

One intriguing property pursued by the community is the ability to learn flows with straight trajectories which realize the optimal transport (OT) displacements. Straightness is crucial for fast integration of the learned flow's paths. Unfortunately, most existing flow straightening methods are based on non-trivial iterative procedures which accumulate the error during training or exploit heuristic minibatch OT approximations. To address this issue, we develop a novel optimal flow matching approach which recovers the straight OT displacement for the quadratic cost in just one flow matching step.</p></details> |  |
| **[D-Cubed: Latent Diffusion Trajectory Optimisation for Dexterous Deformable Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12861v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mastering dexterous robotic manipulation of deformable objects is vital for overcoming the limitations of parallel grippers in real-world applications. Current trajectory optimisation approaches often struggle to solve such tasks due to the large search space and the limited task information available from a cost function. In this work, we propose D-Cubed, a novel trajectory optimisation method using a latent diffusion model (LDM) trained from a task-agnostic play dataset to solve dexterous deformable object manipulation tasks. D-Cubed learns a skill-latent space that encodes short-horizon actions in the play dataset using a VAE and trains a LDM to compose the skill latents into a skill trajectory, representing a long-horizon action trajectory in the dataset. To optimise a trajectory for a target task, we introduce a novel gradient-free guided sampling method that employs the Cross-Entropy method within the reverse diffusion process. In particular, D-Cubed samples a small number of noisy skill trajectories using the LDM for exploration and evaluates the trajectories in simulation. Then, D-Cubed selects the trajectory with the lowest cost for the subsequent reverse process. This effectively explores promising solution areas and optimises the sampled trajectories towards a target task throughout the reverse diffusion process. Through empirical evaluation on a public benchmark of dexterous deformable object manipulation tasks, we demonstrate that D-Cubed outperforms traditional trajectory optimisation and competitive baseline approaches by a significant margin. We further demonstrate that trajectories found by D-Cubed readily transfer to a real-world LEAP hand on a folding task.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://applied-ai-lab.github.io/D-cubed/</p></details> |
| **[Generalized Consistency Trajectory Models for Image Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12510v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models excel in unconditional generation, as well as on applied tasks such as image editing and restoration. The success of diffusion models lies in the iterative nature of diffusion: diffusion breaks down the complex process of mapping noise to data into a sequence of simple denoising tasks. Moreover, we are able to exert fine-grained control over the generation process by injecting guidance terms into each denoising step. However, the iterative process is also computationally intensive, often taking from tens up to thousands of function evaluations. Although consistency trajectory models (CTMs) enable traversal between any time points along the probability flow ODE (PFODE) and score inference with a single function evaluation, CTMs only allow translation from Gaussian noise to data. Thus, this work aims to unlock the full potential of CTMs by proposing generalized CTMs (GCTMs), which translate between arbitrary distributions via ODEs. We discuss the design space of GCTMs and demonstrate their efficacy in various image manipulation tasks such as image-to-image translation, restoration, and editing.

| **[Boosting Transferability in Vision-Language Attacks via Diversification along the Intersection Region of Adversarial Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12445v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language pre-training (VLP) models exhibit remarkable capabilities in comprehending both images and text, yet they remain susceptible to multimodal adversarial examples (AEs). Strengthening adversarial attacks and uncovering vulnerabilities, especially common issues in VLP models (e.g., high transferable AEs), can stimulate further research on constructing reliable and practical VLP models. A recent work (i.e., Set-level guidance attack) indicates that augmenting image-text pairs to increase AE diversity along the optimization path enhances the transferability of adversarial examples significantly. However, this approach predominantly emphasizes diversity around the online adversarial examples (i.e., AEs in the optimization period), leading to the risk of overfitting the victim model and affecting the transferability. In this study, we posit that the diversity of adversarial examples towards the clean input and online AEs are both pivotal for enhancing transferability across VLP models. Consequently, we propose using diversification along the intersection region of adversarial trajectory to expand the diversity of AEs. To fully leverage the interaction between modalities, we introduce text-guided adversarial example selection during optimization. Furthermore, to further mitigate the potential overfitting, we direct the adversarial text deviating from the last intersection region along the optimization path, rather than adversarial images as in existing methods. Extensive experiments affirm the effectiveness of our method in improving transferability across various VLP models and downstream vision-and-language tasks (e.g., Image-Text Retrieval(ITR), Visual Grounding(VG), Image Captioning(IC)).</p></details> |  |

Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has demonstrated commendable performance as a popular and representative method. However, it is implemented with a fixed intrinsic rank that might not be the ideal setting for the downstream tasks. Recognizing the need for more flexible downstream task adaptation, we extend the methodology of LoRA to an innovative approach we call allocating low-rank adaptation (ALoRA) that enables dynamic adjustments to the intrinsic rank during the adaptation process. First, we propose a novel method, AB-LoRA, that can effectively estimate the importance score of each LoRA rank. Second, guided by AB-LoRA, we gradually prune abundant and negatively impacting LoRA ranks and allocate the pruned LoRA budgets to important Transformer modules needing higher ranks. We have conducted experiments on various tasks, and the experimental results demonstrate that our ALoRA method can outperform the recent baselines with comparable tunable parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NAACL-2024</p></details> |

In CTG, the generated text draws upon contextual cues from both the source document and the cited paper, ensuring accurate and relevant citation information is provided. Previous work in the field of citation generation is mainly based on the text summarization of documents. Following this, this paper presents a framework, and a comparative study to demonstrate the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for the task of citation generation. Also, we have shown the improvement in the results of citation generation by incorporating the knowledge graph relations of the papers in the prompt for the LLM to better learn the relationship between the papers. To assess how well our model is performing, we have used a subset of standard S2ORC dataset, which only consists of computer science academic research papers in the English Language. Vicuna performs best for this task with 14.15 Meteor, 12.88 Rouge-1, 1.52 Rouge-2, and 10.94 Rouge-L. Also, Alpaca performs best, and improves the performance by 36.98% in Rouge-1, and 33.14% in Meteor by including knowledge graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resilience of Large Language Models for Noisy Instructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09754v1)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the rapidly advancing domain of natural language processing (NLP), large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting human commands and generating text across various tasks. Nonetheless, the resilience of LLMs to handle text containing inherent errors, stemming from human interactions and collaborative systems, has not been thoroughly explored. Our study investigates the resilience of LLMs against five common types of disruptions including 1) ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) errors, 2) OCR (Optical Character Recognition) errors, 3) grammatical mistakes, 4) typographical errors, and 5) distractive content. We aim to investigate how these models react by deliberately embedding these errors into instructions. Our findings reveal that while some LLMs show a degree of resistance to certain types of noise, their overall performance significantly suffers. This emphasizes the importance of further investigation into enhancing model resilience. In response to the observed decline in performance, our study also evaluates a "re-pass" strategy, designed to purify the instructions of noise before the LLMs process them. Our analysis indicates that correcting noisy instructions, particularly for open-source LLMs, presents significant challenges.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Our protocols, driven by prediction and performance metrics, surpass both FedAvg and local fine-tuning methods, which is particularly evident in realistic scenarios with more diverse local data distributions. The results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in addressing heterogeneity and scarcity within local datasets.</p></details> |  |

Conventional Structure from Motion (SfM) methods for camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction fail in these environments due to poor correspondence construction. To address these challenges, this paper introduces LetsGo, a LiDAR-assisted Gaussian splatting approach for large-scale garage modeling and rendering. We develop a handheld scanner, Polar, equipped with IMU, LiDAR, and a fisheye camera, to facilitate accurate LiDAR and image data scanning. With this Polar device, we present a GarageWorld dataset consisting of five expansive garage scenes with diverse geometric structures and will release the dataset to the community for further research. We demonstrate that the collected LiDAR point cloud by the Polar device enhances a suite of 3D Gaussian splatting algorithms for garage scene modeling and rendering. We also propose a novel depth regularizer for 3D Gaussian splatting algorithm training, effectively eliminating floating artifacts in rendered images, and a lightweight Level of Detail (LOD) Gaussian renderer for real-time viewing on web-based devices. Additionally, we explore a hybrid representation that combines the advantages of traditional mesh in depicting simple geometry and colors (e.g., walls and the ground) with modern 3D Gaussian representations capturing complex details and high-frequency textures. This strategy achieves an optimal balance between memory performance and rendering quality. Experimental results on our dataset, along with ScanNet++ and KITTI-360, demonstrate the superiority of our method in rendering quality and resource efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://jdtsui.github.io/letsgo/</p></details> |

Conversational query-answering is an emerging approach for user engagement. There is an increasing demand of an advanced conversational question-answering that goes beyond classic systems. Existing approaches have shown that LLMs offer promising capabilities for CQA, but may struggle to capture the nuances of conversational contexts. The new approach involves understanding the content and engaging in a multi-step conversation with the user to fulfill their needs. This paper presents a novel method to elevate the performance of Persian Conversational question-answering (CQA) systems. It combines the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) with contextual keyword extraction. Our method extracts keywords specific to the conversational flow, providing the LLM with additional context to understand the user's intent and generate more relevant and coherent responses. We evaluated the effectiveness of this combined approach through various metrics, demonstrating significant improvements in CQA performance compared to an LLM-only baseline. The proposed method effectively handles implicit questions, delivers contextually relevant answers, and tackles complex questions that rely heavily on conversational context. The findings indicate that our method outperformed the evaluation benchmarks up to 8% higher than existing methods and the LLM-only baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse Global Matching for Video Frame Interpolation with Large Motion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06913v2)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large motion poses a critical challenge in Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) task. Existing methods are often constrained by limited receptive fields, resulting in sub-optimal performance when handling scenarios with large motion. In this paper, we introduce a new pipeline for VFI, which can effectively integrate global-level information to alleviate issues associated with large motion. Specifically, we first estimate a pair of initial intermediate flows using a high-resolution feature map for extracting local details. Then, we incorporate a sparse global matching branch to compensate for flow estimation, which consists of identifying flaws in initial flows and generating sparse flow compensation with a global receptive field. Finally, we adaptively merge the initial flow estimation with global flow compensation, yielding a more accurate intermediate flow. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method in handling large motion, we carefully curate a more challenging subset from commonly used benchmarks.

| **[Psychometric Predictive Power of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07484v3)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction tuning aligns the response of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Despite such efforts in human--LLM alignment, we find that instruction tuning does not always make LLMs human-like from a cognitive modeling perspective. More specifically, next-word probabilities estimated by instruction-tuned LLMs are often worse at simulating human reading behavior than those estimated by base LLMs. In addition, we explore prompting methodologies for simulating human reading behavior with LLMs. Our results show that prompts reflecting a particular linguistic hypothesis improve psychometric predictive power, but are still inferior to small base models. These findings highlight that recent advancements in LLMs, i.e., instruction tuning and prompting, do not offer better estimates than direct probability measurements from base LLMs in cognitive modeling. In other words, pure next-word probability remains a strong predictor for human reading behavior, even in the age of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages; Findings of NAACL 2024</p></details> |
| **[Are Large Language Models Reliable Argument Quality Annotators?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09696v1)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the quality of arguments is a crucial aspect of any system leveraging argument mining. However, it is a challenge to obtain reliable and consistent annotations regarding argument quality, as this usually requires domain-specific expertise of the annotators. Even among experts, the assessment of argument quality is often inconsistent due to the inherent subjectivity of this task. In this paper, we study the potential of using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) as proxies for argument quality annotators. To assess the capability of LLMs in this regard, we analyze the agreement between model, human expert, and human novice annotators based on an established taxonomy of argument quality dimensions. Our findings highlight that LLMs can produce consistent annotations, with a moderately high agreement with human experts across most of the quality dimensions. Moreover, we show that using LLMs as additional annotators can significantly improve the agreement between annotators. These results suggest that LLMs can serve as a valuable tool for automated argument quality assessment, thus streamlining and accelerating the evaluation of large argument datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

How to reduce the parameter scale of LLMs has become research hotspots. In this study, we make an important observation that the multi-head self-attention (MHA) sub-layer of Transformer exhibits noticeable low-rank structure, while the feed-forward network (FFN) sub-layer does not. With this regard, we design a mixed compression model, which organically combines Low-Rank matrix approximation And structured Pruning (LoRAP). For the MHA sub-layer, we propose an input activation weighted singular value decomposition method to strengthen the low-rank characteristic. Furthermore, we discover that the weight matrices in MHA sub-layer have different low-rank degrees. Thus, a novel parameter allocation scheme according to the discrepancy of low-rank degrees is devised. For the FFN sub-layer, we propose a gradient-free structured channel pruning method. During the pruning, we get an interesting finding that the least important 1% of parameter actually play a vital role in model performance. Extensive evaluations on zero-shot perplexity and zero-shot task classification indicate that our proposal is superior to previous structured compression rivals under multiple compression ratios.</p></details> | 8 pages,4 figures |

However, existing PTQ methods only focus on handling the outliers within one layer or one block, which ignores the dependency of blocks and leads to severe performance degradation in low-bit settings. In this paper, we propose CBQ, a cross-block reconstruction-based PTQ method for LLMs. CBQ employs a cross-block dependency using a homologous reconstruction scheme, establishing long-range dependencies across multiple blocks to minimize error accumulation. Furthermore, CBQ incorporates a coarse-to-fine preprocessing (CFP) strategy for suppressing weight and activation outliers, coupled with an adaptive LoRA-Rounding technique for precise weight quantization. These innovations enable CBQ to not only handle extreme outliers effectively but also improve overall quantization accuracy. Extensive experiments show that CBQ achieves superior low-bit quantization (W4A4, W4A8, W2A16) and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across various LLMs and datasets. Notably, CBQ quantizes the 4-bit LLAMA1-65B model within only 4.3 hours on a single GPU, achieving a commendable tradeoff between performance and quantization efficiency.</p></details> |  |

The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Large Language Models in Issuing Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions: Fostering Physical Activity in a Prospective Cardiac Rehabilitation Setting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08658v2)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigated the viability of using Large Language Models (LLMs) for triggering and personalizing content for Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) in digital health. JITAIs are being explored as a key mechanism for sustainable behavior change, adapting interventions to an individual's current context and needs. However, traditional rule-based and machine learning models for JITAI implementation face scalability and flexibility limitations, such as lack of personalization, difficulty in managing multi-parametric systems, and issues with data sparsity. To investigate JITAI implementation via LLMs, we tested the contemporary overall performance-leading model 'GPT-4' with examples grounded in the use case of fostering heart-healthy physical activity in outpatient cardiac rehabilitation. Three personas and five sets of context information per persona were used as a basis of triggering and personalizing JITAIs. Subsequently, we generated a total of 450 proposed JITAI decisions and message content, divided equally into JITAIs generated by 10 iterations with GPT-4, a baseline provided by 10 laypersons (LayPs), and a gold standard set by 10 healthcare professionals (HCPs). Ratings from 27 LayPs and 11 HCPs indicated that JITAIs generated by GPT-4 were superior to those by HCPs and LayPs over all assessed scales: i.e., appropriateness, engagement, effectiveness, and professionality. This study indicates that LLMs have significant potential for implementing JITAIs as a building block of personalized or "precision" health, offering scalability, effective personalization based on opportunistically sampled information, and good acceptability.</p></details> |  |

Large language models can accurately extract triples from simple sentences through few-shot learning or fine-tuning when given appropriate instructions. However, they often miss out when extracting from complex sentences. In this paper, we design an evaluation-filtering framework that integrates large language models with small models for relational triple extraction tasks. The framework includes an evaluation model that can extract related entity pairs with high precision. We propose a simple labeling principle and a deep neural network to build the model, embedding the outputs as prompts into the extraction process of the large model. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that the proposed method can assist large language models in obtaining more accurate extraction results, especially from complex sentences containing multiple relational triples. Our evaluation model can also be embedded into traditional extraction models to enhance their extraction precision from complex sentences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at LREC-COLING 2024 main conference</p></details> |
| **[Large language models and linguistic intentionality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09576v1)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Do large language models like Chat-GPT or LLaMa meaningfully use the words they produce? Or are they merely clever prediction machines, simulating language use by producing statistically plausible text? There have already been some initial attempts to answer this question by showing that these models meet the criteria for entering meaningful states according to metasemantic theories of mental content. In this paper, I will argue for a different approach - that we should instead consider whether language models meet the criteria given by our best metasemantic theories of linguistic content. In that vein, I will illustrate how this can be done by applying two such theories to the case of language models: Gareth Evans' (1982) account of naming practices and Ruth Millikan's (1984, 2004, 2005) teleosemantics. In doing so, I will argue that it is a mistake to think that the failure of LLMs to meet plausible conditions for mental intentionality thereby renders their outputs meaningless, and that a distinguishing feature of linguistic intentionality - dependency on a pre-existing linguistic system - allows for the plausible result LLM outputs are meaningful.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models as Optimizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03409v3)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization is ubiquitous. While derivative-based algorithms have been powerful tools for various problems, the absence of gradient imposes challenges on many real-world applications. In this work, we propose Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), a simple and effective approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as optimizers, where the optimization task is described in natural language. In each optimization step, the LLM generates new solutions from the prompt that contains previously generated solutions with their values, then the new solutions are evaluated and added to the prompt for the next optimization step. We first showcase OPRO on linear regression and traveling salesman problems, then move on to our main application in prompt optimization, where the goal is to find instructions that maximize the task accuracy. With a variety of LLMs, we demonstrate that the best prompts optimized by OPRO outperform human-designed prompts by up to 8% on GSM8K, and by up to 50% on Big-Bench Hard tasks.

For longer input prompt lengths, prefilling will incur a significant overhead on decoding time. In this work, we highlight the following pitfall of prefilling: for batches containing high-varying prompt lengths, significant computation is wasted by the standard practice of padding sequences to the maximum length. As LLMs increasingly support longer context lengths, potentially up to 10 million tokens, variations in prompt lengths within a batch become more pronounced. To address this, we propose Prepacking, a simple yet effective method to optimize prefilling computation. To avoid redundant computation on pad tokens, prepacking combines prompts of varying lengths into a sequence and packs multiple sequences into a compact batch using a bin-packing algorithm. It then modifies the attention mask and positional encoding to compute multiple prefilled KV-caches for multiple prompts within a single sequence. On standard curated dataset containing prompts with varying lengths, we obtain a significant speed and memory efficiency improvements as compared to the default padding-based prefilling computation within Huggingface across a range of base model configurations and inference serving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, code in https://github.com/siyan-zhao/prepacking</p></details> |

Restricted by static parallelism strategies, existing LLM serving systems cannot efficiently utilize the underlying resources to serve variable-length requests in different phases. To address this problem, we propose a new parallelism paradigm, elastic sequence parallelism (ESP), to elastically adapt to the variance between different requests and phases. Based on ESP, we design and build LoongServe, an LLM serving system that (1) improves computation efficiency by elastically adjusting the degree of parallelism in real-time, (2) improves communication efficiency by reducing key-value cache migration overhead and overlapping partial decoding communication with computation, and (3) improves GPU memory efficiency by reducing key-value cache fragmentation across instances. Our evaluation under diverse real-world datasets shows that LoongServe improves the maximum throughput by up to 3.85$\times$ compared to the chunked prefill and 5.81$\times$ compared to the prefill-decoding disaggregation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Paradigm Boosting Translation Capabilities of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11430v2)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a study on strategies to enhance the translation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in the context of machine translation (MT) tasks. The paper proposes a novel paradigm consisting of three stages: Secondary Pre-training using Extensive Monolingual Data, Continual Pre-training with Interlinear Text Format Documents, and Leveraging Source-Language Consistent Instruction for Supervised Fine-Tuning. Previous research on LLMs focused on various strategies for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), but their effectiveness has been limited. While traditional machine translation approaches rely on vast amounts of parallel bilingual data, our paradigm highlights the importance of using smaller sets of high-quality bilingual data. We argue that the focus should be on augmenting LLMs' cross-lingual alignment abilities during pre-training rather than solely relying on extensive bilingual data during SFT. Experimental results conducted using the Llama2 model, particularly on Chinese-Llama2 after monolingual augmentation, demonstrate the improved translation capabilities of LLMs. A significant contribution of our approach lies in Stage2: Continual Pre-training with Interlinear Text Format Documents, which requires less than 1B training data, making our method highly efficient. Additionally, in Stage3, we observed that setting instructions consistent with the source language benefits the supervised fine-tuning process. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach surpasses previous work and achieves superior performance compared to models such as NLLB-54B and GPT3.5-text-davinci-003, despite having a significantly smaller parameter count of only 7B or 13B. This achievement establishes our method as a pioneering strategy in the field of machine translation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in NAACL 2024</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a novel in-context learning framework, FeatLLM, which employs LLMs as feature engineers to produce an input data set that is optimally suited for tabular predictions. The generated features are used to infer class likelihood with a simple downstream machine learning model, such as linear regression and yields high performance few-shot learning. The proposed FeatLLM framework only uses this simple predictive model with the discovered features at inference time. Compared to existing LLM-based approaches, FeatLLM eliminates the need to send queries to the LLM for each sample at inference time. Moreover, it merely requires API-level access to LLMs, and overcomes prompt size limitations. As demonstrated across numerous tabular datasets from a wide range of domains, FeatLLM generates high-quality rules, significantly (10% on average) outperforming alternatives such as TabLLM and STUNT.</p></details> |  |

While recent developments in Large Multimodal Models have demonstrated remarkable abilities in visual reasoning and mathematical tasks, there is little work on investigating whether these models can effectively interpret visual elements for code generation. To this end, we present MMCode, the first multi-modal coding dataset for evaluating algorithmic problem-solving skills in visually rich contexts. MMCode contains 3,548 questions and 6,620 images collected from real-world programming challenges harvested from 10 code competition websites, presenting significant challenges due to the extreme demand for reasoning abilities. Our experiment results show that current state-of-the-art models struggle to solve these problems.

It is interesting how the LLMs obtain their ability to carry out translation instructions for different languages. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis by finetuning a multilingual pretrained language model, XGLM-7B, to perform multilingual translation following given instructions. Firstly, we show that multilingual LLMs have stronger translation abilities than previously demonstrated. For a certain language, the performance depends on its similarity to English and the amount of data used in the pretraining phase. Secondly, we find that LLMs' ability to carry out translation instructions relies on the understanding of translation instructions and the alignment among different languages. With multilingual finetuning, LLMs could learn to perform the translation task well even for those language pairs unseen during the instruction tuning phase.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by Transaction of ACL, pre-MIT version</p></details> |

At the same time, in order to further improve the convergence rate, we construct the maximum residual average block Kaczmarz method to avoid the calculation of pseudo-inverse in block iteration, which completes the iteration by projecting the iteration vector $x_{k}$ to each row of the constrained subset of $A$ and applying different extrapolation step sizes to average them. We prove the convergence of these two methods and give the upper bounds on their convergence rates, respectively. Numerical experiments validate our theory and show that our proposed methods are superior to some other block Kaczmarz methods.</p></details> |  |

We discover that traditional continual training leads to catastrophic forgetting under compute constraints, unable to outperform zero-shot segmentation methods. We introduce a novel strategy for semantic and panoptic segmentation with zero forgetting, capable of adapting to continually growing vocabularies without the need for retraining or large memory costs. Our training-free approach, kNN-CLIP, leverages a database of instance embeddings to enable open-vocabulary segmentation approaches to continually expand their vocabulary on any given domain with a single-pass through data, while only storing embeddings minimizing both compute and memory costs. This method achieves state-of-the-art mIoU performance across large-vocabulary semantic and panoptic segmentation datasets. We hope kNN-CLIP represents a step forward in enabling more efficient and adaptable continual segmentation, paving the way for advances in real-world large-vocabulary continual segmentation methods.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

While Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have made significant advancements in enhancing recommender systems by modeling user-item interactions and incorporating textual side information, DNN-based methods still face limitations, such as difficulties in understanding users' interests and capturing textual side information, inabilities in generalizing to various recommendation scenarios and reasoning on their predictions, etc. Meanwhile, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT4, has revolutionized the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), due to their remarkable abilities in fundamental responsibilities of language understanding and generation, as well as impressive generalization and reasoning capabilities. As a result, recent studies have attempted to harness the power of LLMs to enhance recommender systems. Given the rapid evolution of this research direction in recommender systems, there is a pressing need for a systematic overview that summarizes existing LLM-empowered recommender systems, to provide researchers in relevant fields with an in-depth understanding. Therefore, in this paper, we conduct a comprehensive review of LLM-empowered recommender systems from various aspects including Pre-training, Fine-tuning, and Prompting. More specifically, we first introduce representative methods to harness the power of LLMs (as a feature encoder) for learning representations of users and items.

Multi-domain learning is a typical solution in this regard. While considerable efforts have been made in this regard, there are still two long-standing challenges: (1) Accurately depicting the differences among domains using domain features is crucial for enhancing the performance of each domain. However, manually designing domain features and models for numerous domains can be a laborious task. (2) Users typically have limited impressions in only a few domains. Extracting features automatically from other domains and leveraging them to improve the predictive capabilities of each domain has consistently posed a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose an Automatic Domain Feature Extraction and Personalized Integration (DFEI) framework for the large-scale multi-domain recommendation. The framework automatically transforms the behavior of each individual user into an aggregation of all user behaviors within the domain, which serves as the domain features. Unlike offline feature engineering methods, the extracted domain features are higher-order representations and directly related to the target label. Besides, by personalized integration of domain features from other domains for each user and the innovation in the training mode, the DFEI framework can yield more accurate conversion identification. Experimental results on both public and industrial datasets, consisting of over 20 domains, clearly demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significantly better performance compared with SOTA baselines. Furthermore, we have released the source code of the proposed framework at https://github.com/xidongbo/DFEI.</p></details> | 8 pages |

The advanced language understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) present a significant opportunity for extracting relations related to acupoint locations from textual knowledge sources. This study aims to compare the performance of GPT with traditional deep learning models (Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining (BioBERT)) in extracting acupoint-related location relations and assess the impact of pretraining and fine-tuning on GPT's performance. We utilized the World Health Organization Standard Acupuncture Point Locations in the Western Pacific Region (WHO Standard) as our corpus, which consists of descriptions of 361 acupoints. Five types of relations ('direction_of,' 'distance_of,' 'part_of,' 'near_acupoint,' and 'located_near') (n= 3,174) between acupoints were annotated. Five models were compared: BioBERT, LSTM, pre-trained GPT-3.5, fine-tuned GPT-3.5, as well as pre-trained GPT-4. Performance metrics included micro-average exact match precision, recall, and F1 scores. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned GPT-3.5 consistently outperformed other models in F1 scores across all relation types. Overall, it achieved the highest micro-average F1 score of 0.92. This study underscores the effectiveness of LLMs like GPT in extracting relations related to acupoint locations, with implications for accurately modeling acupuncture knowledge and promoting standard implementation in acupuncture training and practice. The findings also contribute to advancing informatics applications in traditional and complementary medicine, showcasing the potential of LLMs in natural language processing.</p></details> |  |

Recent work has focused on decoding techniques to improve factuality during inference by leveraging LLMs' hierarchical representation of factual knowledge, manipulating the predicted distributions at inference time. Current state-of-the-art approaches refine decoding by contrasting early-exit distributions from a lower layer with the final layer to exploit information related to factuality within the model forward procedure. However, such methods often assume the final layer is the most reliable and the lower layer selection process depends on it. In this work, we first propose extrapolation of critical token probabilities beyond the last layer for more accurate contrasting. We additionally employ layer-wise entropy-guided lower layer selection, decoupling the selection process from the final layer. Experiments demonstrate strong performance - surpassing state-of-the-art on multiple different datasets by large margins. Analyses show different kinds of prompts respond to different selection strategies.</p></details> | Work in Progress |

However, their inference computation on modern GPUs is highly inefficient due to the increasing number of tokens they must attend to as they generate new ones. To address this inefficiency, we capitalize on LLMs' problem-solving capabilities to optimize their own inference-time efficiency. We demonstrate with two specific tasks: (a) evaluating complex arithmetic expressions and (b) summarizing news articles. For both tasks, we create custom datasets to fine-tune an LLM. The goal of fine-tuning is twofold: first, to make the LLM learn to solve the evaluation or summarization task, and second, to train it to identify the minimal attention spans required for each step of the task. As a result, the fine-tuned model is able to convert these self-identified minimal attention spans into sparse attention masks on-the-fly during inference. We develop a custom CUDA kernel to take advantage of the reduced context to attend to. We demonstrate that using this custom CUDA kernel improves the throughput of LLM inference by 28%. Our work presents an end-to-end demonstration showing that training LLMs to self-select their attention spans speeds up autoregressive inference in solving real-world tasks.</p></details> |  |

About the cognitive effort and moral-emotional language of LLM arguments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09329v1)** | 2024-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are already as persuasive as humans. However, we know very little about why. This paper investigates the persuasion strategies of LLMs, comparing them with human-generated arguments. Using a dataset of 1,251 participants in an experiment, we analyze the persuaion strategies of LLM-generated and human-generated arguments using measures of cognitive effort (lexical and grammatical complexity) and moral-emotional language (sentiment and moral analysis). The study reveals that LLMs produce arguments that require higher cognitive effort, exhibiting more complex grammatical and lexical structures than human counterparts. Additionally, LLMs demonstrate a significant propensity to engage more deeply with moral language, utilizing both positive and negative moral foundations more frequently than humans. In contrast with previous research, no significant difference was found in the emotional content produced by LLMs and humans. These findings contribute to the discourse on AI and persuasion, highlighting the dual potential of LLMs to both enhance and undermine informational integrity through communication strategies for digital persuasion.</p></details> |  |

We introduce an iterative human-in-the-loop method to identify media storms in a large-scale corpus of news articles. The text is first transformed into signals of dispersion based on several textual characteristics. In each iteration, we apply unsupervised anomaly detection to these signals; each anomaly is then validated by an expert to confirm the presence of a storm, and those results are then used to tune the anomaly detection in the next iteration. We demonstrate the applicability of this method in two scenarios: first, supplementing an initial list of media storms within a specific time frame; and second, detecting media storms in new time periods. We make available a media storm dataset compiled using both scenarios. Both the method and dataset offer the basis for comprehensive empirical research into the concept of media storms, including characterizing them and predicting their outbursts and durations, in mainstream media or social media platforms.</p></details> |  |

While model owners can defend against individual jailbreak prompts through safety training strategies, this relatively passive approach struggles to handle the broader category of similar jailbreaks. To tackle this issue, we introduce FuzzLLM, an automated fuzzing framework designed to proactively test and discover jailbreak vulnerabilities in LLMs. We utilize templates to capture the structural integrity of a prompt and isolate key features of a jailbreak class as constraints. By integrating different base classes into powerful combo attacks and varying the elements of constraints and prohibited questions, FuzzLLM enables efficient testing with reduced manual effort. Extensive experiments demonstrate FuzzLLM's effectiveness and comprehensiveness in vulnerability discovery across various LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Publish by ICASSP 2024 on 3/18/2024; Extended Arxiv version</p></details> |

However, a significant part of our society is affected by partial vision impairment, which leads to discomfort and dependency in daily activities. To address the limitations of this part of society, we propose an intelligent reading assistant based on smart glasses with embedded RGB cameras and a Large Language Model (LLM), whose functionality goes beyond corrective lenses. The video recorded from the egocentric perspective of a person wearing the glasses is processed to localise text information using object detection and optical character recognition methods. The LLM processes the data and allows the user to interact with the text and responds to a given query, thus extending the functionality of corrective lenses with the ability to find and summarize knowledge from the text. To evaluate our method, we create a chat-based application that allows the user to interact with the system. The evaluation is conducted in a real-world setting, such as reading menus in a restaurant, and involves four participants. The results show robust accuracy in text retrieval. The system not only provides accurate meal suggestions but also achieves high user satisfaction, highlighting the potential of smart glasses and LLMs in assisting people with special needs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCHP 2024</p></details> |

To obtain a knowledgeable agent, a promising approach is to leverage the knowledge from large language models (LLMs). Despite previous studies combining LLMs with RL, seamless integration of the two components remains challenging due to their semantic gap. This paper introduces a novel method, Knowledgeable Agents from Language Model Rollouts (KALM), which extracts knowledge from LLMs in the form of imaginary rollouts that can be easily learned by the agent through offline reinforcement learning methods. The primary challenge of KALM lies in LLM grounding, as LLMs are inherently limited to textual data, whereas environmental data often comprise numerical vectors unseen to LLMs. To address this, KALM fine-tunes the LLM to perform various tasks based on environmental data, including bidirectional translation between natural language descriptions of skills and their corresponding rollout data. This grounding process enhances the LLM's comprehension of environmental dynamics, enabling it to generate diverse and meaningful imaginary rollouts that reflect novel skills. Initial empirical evaluations on the CLEVR-Robot environment demonstrate that KALM enables agents to complete complex rephrasings of task goals and extend their capabilities to novel tasks requiring unprecedented optimal behaviors. KALM achieves a success rate of 46% in executing tasks with unseen goals, substantially surpassing the 26% success rate achieved by baseline methods. Furthermore, KALM effectively enables the LLM to comprehend environmental dynamics, resulting in the generation of meaningful imaginary rollouts that reflect novel skills and demonstrate the seamless integration of large language models and reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |

By categorizing and analyzing LLM applications within core robotics elements -- communication, perception, planning, and control -- we aim to provide actionable insights for researchers seeking to integrate LLMs into their robotic systems. Our investigation focuses on LLMs developed post-GPT-3.5, primarily in text-based modalities while also considering multimodal approaches for perception and control. We offer comprehensive guidelines and examples for prompt engineering, facilitating beginners' access to LLM-based robotics solutions. Through tutorial-level examples and structured prompt construction, we illustrate how LLM-guided enhancements can be seamlessly integrated into robotics applications.

We conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the harmlessness performance of representative MLLMs and reveal that the image input poses the alignment vulnerability of MLLMs. Inspired by this, we propose a novel jailbreak method named HADES, which hides and amplifies the harmfulness of the malicious intent within the text input, using meticulously crafted images. Experimental results show that HADES can effectively jailbreak existing MLLMs, which achieves an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 90.26% for LLaVA-1.5 and 71.60% for Gemini Pro Vision.

| **[Compass: Large Multilingual Language Model for South-east Asia](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09220v1)** | 2024-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have exhibited significant proficiency in languages endowed with extensive linguistic resources, such as English and Chinese. Nevertheless, their effectiveness notably diminishes when applied to languages characterized by limited linguistic resources, particularly within the Southeast Asian linguistic landscape, such as Indonesian. The scarcity of linguistic resources for these languages presents challenges associated with inadequate training, restricted vocabulary coverage, and challenging evaluation processes. In response to these exigencies, we have introduced CompassLLM, a large multilingual model specifically tailored for Southeast Asian languages, with the primary aim of supporting the developmental requirements of Shopee. Our methodology encompasses several key strategies. To progressively enhance multilingual proficiencies, we implemented a multi-stage pre-training strategy integrated with curriculum learning, gradually intensifying the focus on low-resource languages. Concurrently, to better accommodate low-resource human instructions, we curated and generated a repository of high-quality multilingual human instructions, culminating the CompassLLM-SFT model through supervised instruction fine-tuning. Finally, to reinforce the model's alignment with human preference behaviors, we have embraced the principle of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to obtain CompassLLM-DPO model. Preliminary evaluation of the CompassLLM model yields promising results, with our model surpassing benchmark models like Vicuna-7b-v1.5, Sealion, Falcon and SeaLLM, across diverse evaluation tasks, as verified through both automated and human-driven assessments. Notably, our model exhibits its superior performance in South-east Asia languages, such as Indonesian language.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Large Language Models as Virtual Annotators for Time-series Physical Sensing Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01133v2)** | 2024-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional human-in-the-loop-based annotation for time-series data like inertial data often requires access to alternate modalities like video or audio from the environment. These alternate sources provide the necessary information to the human annotator, as the raw numeric data is often too obfuscated even for an expert. However, this traditional approach has many concerns surrounding overall cost, efficiency, storage of additional modalities, time, scalability, and privacy. Interestingly, recent large language models (LLMs) are also trained with vast amounts of publicly available alphanumeric data, which allows them to comprehend and perform well on tasks beyond natural language processing. Naturally, this opens up a potential avenue to explore LLMs as virtual annotators where the LLMs will be directly provided the raw sensor data for annotation instead of relying on any alternate modality. Naturally, this could mitigate the problems of the traditional human-in-the-loop approach. Motivated by this observation, we perform a detailed study in this paper to assess whether the state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs can be used as virtual annotators for labeling time-series physical sensing data. To perform this in a principled manner, we segregate the study into two major phases. In the first phase, we investigate the challenges an LLM like GPT-4 faces in comprehending raw sensor data. Considering the observations from phase 1, in the next phase, we investigate the possibility of encoding the raw sensor data using SOTA SSL approaches and utilizing the projected time-series data to get annotations from the LLM. Detailed evaluation with four benchmark HAR datasets shows that SSL-based encoding and metric-based guidance allow the LLM to make more reasonable decisions and provide accurate annotations without requiring computationally expensive fine-tuning or sophisticated prompt engineering.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing MLLMs are not well suited for document-oriented tasks, which require fine-grained image perception and information compression. In this paper, we present TextHawk, a MLLM that is specifically designed for document-oriented tasks, while preserving the general capabilities of MLLMs. TextHawk is aimed to explore efficient fine-grained perception by designing four dedicated components. Firstly, a ReSampling and ReArrangement (ReSA) module is proposed to reduce the redundancy in the document texts and lower the computational cost of the MLLM. We explore encoding the positions of each local feature by presenting Scalable Positional Embeddings (SPEs), which can preserve the scalability of various image sizes. A Query Proposal Network (QPN) is then adopted to initialize the queries dynamically among different sub-images. To further enhance the fine-grained visual perceptual ability of the MLLM, we design a Multi-Level Cross-Attention (MLCA) mechanism that captures the hierarchical structure and semantic relations of document images. Furthermore, we create a new instruction-tuning dataset for document-oriented tasks by enriching the multimodal document data with Gemini Pro. We conduct extensive experiments on both general and document-oriented MLLM benchmarks, and show that TextHawk outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority in fine-grained document perception and general abilities.</p></details> |  |

However, the existing methods 1) generate rationale before the answer, making their answer correctness sensitive to the hallucination in the rationale;2) force the student model to repeat the exact LLMs rationale expression word-after-word, which could have the model biased towards learning the expression in rationale but count against the model from understanding the core logic behind it. Therefore, we propose a robust Post-Semantic-Thinking (PST) strategy to generate answers before rationale. Thanks to this answer-first setting, 1) the answering procedure can escape from the adverse effects caused by hallucinations in the rationale; 2) the complex reasoning procedure is tightly bound with the relatively concise answer, making the reasoning for questions easier with the prior information in the answer; 3) the efficiency of the method can also benefit from the setting since users can stop the generation right after answers are outputted when inference is conducted. Furthermore, the PST strategy loose the constraint against the generated rationale to be close to the LLMs gold standard in the hidden semantic space instead of the vocabulary space, thus making the small student model better comprehend the semantic reasoning logic in rationale. Extensive experiments conducted across 12 reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of PST.</p></details> |  |

Researchers have explored ways to use this generated synthetic data to optimize smaller student models for reduced deployment costs and lower latency in downstream tasks. However, ICL-generated data often suffers from low quality as the task specificity is limited with few examples used in ICL. In this paper, we propose GeMQuAD - a semi-supervised learning approach, extending the WeakDAP framework, applied to a dataset generated through ICL with just one example in the target language using AlexaTM 20B Seq2Seq LLM. Through our approach, we iteratively identify high-quality data to enhance model performance, especially for low-resource multilingual setting in the context of Extractive Question Answering task. Our framework outperforms the machine translation-augmented model by 0.22/1.68 F1/EM (Exact Match) points for Hindi and 0.82/1.37 F1/EM points for Spanish on the MLQA dataset, and it surpasses the performance of model trained on an English-only dataset by 5.05/6.50 F1/EM points for Hindi and 3.81/3.69 points F1/EM for Spanish on the same dataset. Notably, our approach uses a pre-trained LLM for generation with no fine-tuning (FT), utilizing just a single annotated example in ICL to generate data, providing a cost-effective development process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to The 37th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023)December 10-16, 2023 - SyntheticData4ML workshop, New Orleans, United States https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2023</p></details> |
| **[Making Large Language Models Perform Better in Knowledge Graph Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06671v2)** | 2024-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) based knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to predict the missing triples in the KGs with LLMs. However, research about LLM-based KGC fails to sufficiently harness LLMs' inference proficiencies, overlooking critical structural information integral to KGs. In this paper, we explore methods to incorporate structural information into the LLMs, with the overarching goal of facilitating structure-aware reasoning. We first discuss on the existing LLM paradigms like in-context learning and instruction tuning, proposing basic structural information injection approaches. Then we propose a Knowledge Prefix Adapter (KoPA) to fulfill this stated goal. The KoPA uses a structural pre-training phase to comprehend the intricate entities and relations within KGs, representing them as structural embeddings. Then KoPA communicates such cross-modal structural information understanding to the LLMs through a knowledge prefix adapter which projects the structural embeddings into the textual space and obtains virtual knowledge tokens positioned as a prefix of the input prompt. We conduct comprehensive experiments and provide incisive analysis concerning how the introduction of cross-modal structural information would be better for LLM's factual knowledge reasoning ability. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/zjukg/KoPA .</p></details> | Working in progress |

However, the use of external feedback as a stop criterion raises doubts about the true extent of LLMs' ability to emulate human-like self-reflection. In this paper, we set out to clarify these capabilities under a more stringent evaluation setting in which we disallow any kind of external feedback. Our findings under this setting show a split: while self-reflection enhances performance in TruthfulQA, it adversely affects results in HotpotQA. We conduct follow-up analyses to clarify the contributing factors in these patterns, and find that the influence of self-reflection is impacted both by reliability of accuracy in models' initial responses, and by overall question difficulty: specifically, self-reflection shows the most benefit when models are less likely to be correct initially, and when overall question difficulty is higher. We also find that self-reflection reduces tendency toward majority voting. Based on our findings, we propose guidelines for decisions on when to implement self-reflection. We release the codebase for reproducing our experiments at https://github.com/yanhong-lbh/LLM-SelfReflection-Eval.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2024 Findings paper (Camera-Ready Version)</p></details> |

Nevertheless, these models frequently experience significant issues with generating inaccurate information, which is hallucination. In this study, we concentrate on a specific type of hallucination-number hallucination, referring to models incorrectly identifying the number of certain objects in pictures. We perform quantitative evaluations regarding number hallucination, showing it to be critical in major open-source large vision-language models. Furthermore, we utilizes two related tasks to conduct an in-depth analysis of number hallucination, revealing the severe inner and outer inconsistency among all tasks. Based on this examination, we devise a training approach aimed at improving consistency to reduce number hallucinations, which leads to an 8% enhancement in performance over direct finetuning methods. Our code and dataset will be released to the community.</p></details> | 10 pages |

(2020) and Cremon et al. (2020), on large-scale thermal CO2 injection cases. For Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) projects, injecting CO2 under supercritical conditions is typically tens of degrees colder than the reservoir temperature. Thermal effects can have a significant impact on the simulation results, but they also add many challenges for the solvers. More specifically, the usual combination of an iterative linear solver (such as GMRES) and the Constrained Pressure Residual (CPR) physics-based block-preconditioner is known to perform rather poorly or fail to converge when thermal effects play a significant role. The Constrained Pressure-Temperature Residual (CPTR) preconditioner retains the 2x2 block structure (elliptic/hyperbolic) of CPR but includes the temperature in the elliptic subsystem. The elliptic subsystem is now formed by two equations, and is dealt with by the system-solver of BoomerAMG (from the HYPRE library). Then a global smoother, ILU(0), is applied to the full system to handle the local, hyperbolic temperature fronts. We implemented CPTR in the multi-physics solver GEOS and present results on various large-scale thermal CCS simulation cases, including both Cartesian and fully unstructured meshes, up to tens of millions of degrees of freedom. The CPTR preconditioner severely reduces the number of GMRES iterations and the runtime, with cases timing out in 24h with CPR now requiring a few hours with CPTR. We present strong scaling results using hundreds of CPU cores for multiple cases, and show close to linear scaling. CPTR is also virtually insensitive to the thermal Peclet number (which compares advection and diffusion effects) and is suitable to any thermal regime.</p></details> |  |

Such models enable end-to-end generation of higher-quality music, and some allow conditioned generation using text descriptions. However, the control power of text controls on music is intrinsically limited, as they can only describe music indirectly through meta-data (such as singers and instruments) or high-level representations (such as genre and emotion). We aim to further equip the models with direct and content-based controls on innate music languages such as pitch, chords and drum track. To this end, we contribute Coco-Mulla, a content-based control method for music large language modeling. It uses a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method tailored for Transformer-based audio models. Experiments show that our approach achieved high-quality music generation with low-resource semi-supervised learning, tuning with less than 4% parameters compared to the original model and training on a small dataset with fewer than 300 songs. Moreover, our approach enables effective content-based controls, and we illustrate the control power via chords and rhythms, two of the most salient features of music audio. Furthermore, we show that by combining content-based controls and text descriptions, our system achieves flexible music variation generation and arrangement. Our source codes and demos are available online.</p></details> |  |

However, the current research fails to adequately address the prediction of mental health conditions from social media data in low-resource African languages like Swahili. This study introduces two distinct approaches utilising model-agnostic meta-learning and leveraging large language models (LLMs) to address this gap. Experiments are conducted on three datasets translated to low-resource language and applied to four mental health tasks, which include stress, depression, depression severity and suicidal ideation prediction. we first apply a meta-learning model with self-supervision, which results in improved model initialisation for rapid adaptation and cross-lingual transfer. The results show that our meta-trained model performs significantly better than standard fine-tuning methods, outperforming the baseline fine-tuning in macro F1 score with 18\% and 0.8\% over XLM-R and mBERT. In parallel, we use LLMs' in-context learning capabilities to assess their performance accuracy across the Swahili mental health prediction tasks by analysing different cross-lingual prompting approaches. Our analysis showed that Swahili prompts performed better than cross-lingual prompts but less than English prompts. Our findings show that in-context learning can be achieved through cross-lingual transfer through carefully crafted prompt templates with examples and instructions.</p></details> |  |

Due to their impressive abilities, LLMs have shed light on potential inter-discipline applications to foster scientific discoveries of a specific domain by using artificial intelligence (AI for science, AI4S). In the meantime, utilizing NLP techniques in geoscience research and practice is wide and convoluted, contributing from knowledge extraction and document classification to question answering and knowledge discovery. In this work, we take the initial step to leverage LLM for science, through a rather straightforward approach. We try to specialize an LLM into geoscience, by further pre-training the model with a vast amount of texts in geoscience, as well as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) the resulting model with our custom collected instruction tuning dataset. These efforts result in a model GeoGalactica consisting of 30 billion parameters. To our best knowledge, it is the largest language model for the geoscience domain. More specifically, GeoGalactica is from further pre-training of Galactica. We train GeoGalactica over a geoscience-related text corpus containing 65 billion tokens, preserving as the largest geoscience-specific text corpus. Then we fine-tune the model with 1 million pairs of instruction-tuning data consisting of questions that demand professional geoscience knowledge to answer. In this technical report, we will illustrate in detail all aspects of GeoGalactica, including data collection, data cleaning, base model selection, pre-training, SFT, and evaluation. We open-source our data curation tools and the checkpoints of GeoGalactica during the first 3/4 of pre-training.</p></details> |  |

Exploring Probability Distribution Sampling in Large Language Models for Behavioral Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09043v1)** | 2024-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and their remarkable capabilities in handling complex language tasks, an increasing number of studies are employing LLMs as agents to emulate the sequential decision-making processes of humans often represented as Markov decision-making processes (MDPs). The actions within this decision-making framework adhere to specific probability distributions and require iterative sampling. This arouses our curiosity regarding the capacity of LLM agents to comprehend probability distributions, thereby guiding the agent's behavioral decision-making through probabilistic sampling and generating behavioral sequences. To answer the above question, we divide the problem into two main aspects: simulation where the exact probability distribution is known, and generation of sequences where the probability distribution is ambiguous. In the first case, the agent is required to give the type and parameters of the probability distribution through the problem description, and then give the sampling sequence. However, our analysis shows that LLM agents perform poorly in this case, but the sampling success rate can be improved through programming tools. Real-world scenarios often entail unknown probability distributions. Thus, in the second case, we ask the agents to change the activity level in online social networks and analyze the frequency of actions. Ultimately, our analysis shows that LLM agents cannot sample probability distributions even using programming tools. Therefore, careful consideration is still required before directly applying LLM agents as agents to simulate human behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable Traffic Flow Prediction with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02937v3)** | 2024-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic flow prediction is crucial for intelligent transportation systems. It has experienced significant advancements thanks to the power of deep learning in capturing latent patterns of traffic data. However, recent deep-learning architectures require intricate model designs and lack an intuitive understanding of the mapping from input data to predicted results. Achieving both accuracy and interpretability in traffic prediction models remains to be a challenge due to the complexity of traffic data and the inherent opacity of deep learning models. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel approach, Traffic Flow Prediction LLM (TF-LLM), which leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate interpretable traffic flow predictions. By transferring multi-modal traffic data into natural language descriptions, TF-LLM captures complex spatial-temporal patterns and external factors from comprehensive traffic data. The LLM framework is fine-tuned using language-based instructions to align with spatial-temporal traffic flow data. Empirically, TF-LLM shows competitive accuracy compared with deep learning baselines, while providing intuitive and interpretable predictions. We discuss the spatial-temporal and input dependencies for explainable future flow forecasting, showcasing TF-LLM's potential for diverse city prediction tasks. This paper contributes to advancing explainable traffic prediction models and lays a foundation for future exploration of LLM applications in transportation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use LLM for interpretable prediction of traffic flow.</p></details> | 27pages, 8 figures |

Despite advancements, challenges persist due to the complexity and diversity inherent in medical tasks which often require multi-task learning capabilities. Previous approaches, although beneficial, fall short in real-world applications because they necessitate task-specific annotations at inference time, limiting broader generalization. This paper introduces MING-MOE, a novel Mixture-of-Expert~(MOE)-based medical large language model designed to manage diverse and complex medical tasks without requiring task-specific annotations, thus enhancing its usability across extensive datasets. MING-MOE employs a Mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation (MoLoRA) technique, allowing for efficient parameter usage by maintaining base model parameters static while adapting through a minimal set of trainable parameters. We demonstrate that MING-MOE achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on over 20 medical tasks, illustrating a significant improvement over existing models. This approach not only extends the capabilities of medical language models but also improves inference efficiency.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |

In this work, we probe LLMs from a human behavioral perspective, correlating values from LLMs with eye-tracking measures, which are widely recognized as meaningful indicators of human reading patterns. Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit a similar prediction pattern with humans but distinct from that of Shallow Language Models (SLMs). Moreover, with the escalation of LLM layers from the middle layers, the correlation coefficients also increase in FFN and MHSA, indicating that the logits within FFN increasingly encapsulate word semantics suitable for predicting tokens from the vocabulary.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by LREC-COLING NeusymBridge 2024</p></details> |
| **[Logic Query of Thoughts: Guiding Large Language Models to Answer Complex Logic Queries with Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04264v2)** | 2024-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the superb performance in many tasks, large language models (LLMs) bear the risk of generating hallucination or even wrong answers when confronted with tasks that demand the accuracy of knowledge. The issue becomes even more noticeable when addressing logic queries that require multiple logic reasoning steps. On the other hand, knowledge graph (KG) based question answering methods are capable of accurately identifying the correct answers with the help of knowledge graph, yet its accuracy could quickly deteriorate when the knowledge graph itself is sparse and incomplete. It remains a critical challenge on how to integrate knowledge graph reasoning with LLMs in a mutually beneficial way so as to mitigate both the hallucination problem of LLMs as well as the incompleteness issue of knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose 'Logic-Query-of-Thoughts' (LGOT) which is the first of its kind to combine LLMs with knowledge graph based logic query reasoning. LGOT seamlessly combines knowledge graph reasoning and LLMs, effectively breaking down complex logic queries into easy to answer subquestions. Through the utilization of both knowledge graph reasoning and LLMs, it successfully derives answers for each subquestion. By aggregating these results and selecting the highest quality candidate answers for each step, LGOT achieves accurate results to complex questions. Our experimental findings demonstrate substantial performance enhancements, with up to 20% improvement over ChatGPT.</p></details> |  |

| **[Event Grounded Criminal Court View Generation with Cooperative (Large) Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07001v2)** | 2024-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of legal intelligence, Criminal Court View Generation has attracted much attention as a crucial task of legal intelligence, which aims to generate concise and coherent texts that summarize case facts and provide explanations for verdicts. Existing researches explore the key information in case facts to yield the court views. Most of them employ a coarse-grained approach that partitions the facts into broad segments (e.g., verdict-related sentences) to make predictions. However, this approach fails to capture the complex details present in the case facts, such as various criminal elements and legal events. To this end, in this paper, we propose an Event Grounded Generation (EGG) method for criminal court view generation with cooperative (Large) Language Models, which introduces the fine-grained event information into the generation. Specifically, we first design a LLMs-based extraction method that can extract events in case facts without massive annotated events. Then, we incorporate the extracted events into court view generation by merging case facts and events. Besides, considering the computational burden posed by the use of LLMs in the extraction phase of EGG, we propose a LLMs-free EGG method that can eliminate the requirement for event extraction using LLMs in the inference phase. Extensive experimental results on a real-world dataset clearly validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGIR2024</p></details> |

With the proliferation of both human-written and machine-generated real and fake news, robustly and effectively discerning the veracity of news articles has become an intricate challenge. While substantial research has been dedicated to fake news detection, this either assumes that all news articles are human-written or abruptly assumes that all machine-generated news are fake. Thus, a significant gap exists in understanding the interplay between machine-(paraphrased) real news, machine-generated fake news, human-written fake news, and human-written real news. In this paper, we study this gap by conducting a comprehensive evaluation of fake news detectors trained in various scenarios. Our primary objectives revolve around the following pivotal question: How to adapt fake news detectors to the era of LLMs? Our experiments reveal an interesting pattern that detectors trained exclusively on human-written articles can indeed perform well at detecting machine-generated fake news, but not vice versa. Moreover, due to the bias of detectors against machine-generated texts \cite{su2023fake}, they should be trained on datasets with a lower machine-generated news ratio than the test set. Building on our findings, we provide a practical strategy for the development of robust fake news detectors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept to NAACL 2024 Findings</p></details> |

We construct a benchmark, SafeEdit, which covers nine unsafe categories with various powerful attack prompts and equips comprehensive metrics for systematic evaluation. We conduct experiments with several knowledge editing approaches, indicating that knowledge editing has the potential to efficiently detoxify LLMs with limited impact on general performance. Then, we propose a simple yet effective baseline, dubbed Detoxifying with Intraoperative Neural Monitoring (DINM), to diminish the toxicity of LLMs within a few tuning steps via only one instance. We further provide an in-depth analysis of the internal mechanism for various detoxifying approaches, demonstrating that previous methods like SFT and DPO may merely suppress the activations of toxic parameters, while DINM mitigates the toxicity of the toxic parameters to a certain extent, making permanent adjustments. We hope that these insights could shed light on future work of developing detoxifying approaches and the underlying knowledge mechanisms of LLMs. Code and benchmark are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing work.

Yet, it remains unexplored whether current VLMs genuinely possess quality object-level image understanding capabilities determined from `what objects are in the image?' or `which object corresponds to a specified bounding box?'. Our findings reveal that the image understanding capabilities of current VLMs are strongly correlated with their zero-shot performance on vision language (VL) tasks. This suggests that prioritizing basic image understanding is crucial for VLMs to excel at VL tasks. To enhance object-level image understanding, we propose Crayon Large Language and Vision mOdel (CoLLaVO), which incorporates instruction tuning with Crayon Prompt as a new visual prompt tuning scheme based on panoptic color maps. Furthermore, we present a learning strategy of Dual QLoRA to preserve object-level image understanding without forgetting it during visual instruction tuning, thereby achieving a significant leap in numerous VL benchmarks in a zero-shot setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available: https://github.com/ByungKwanLee/CoLLaVO</p></details> |

GUI testing, a quality assurance method, has frequently been used for mobile apps. When conducting GUI testing, it is important to generate effective text inputs for the text-input components. Some GUIs require these text inputs to move from one page to the next, which remains a challenge to achieving complete UI exploration. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown excellent text-generation capabilities. Among the LLMs, OpenAI's GPT series has been widely discussed and used. However, it may not be possible to use these LLMs for GUI testing actual mobile apps, due to the security and privacy issues related to the production data. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the potential of different LLMs to guide text-input generation in mobile GUI testing. This paper reports on a large-scale empirical study that extensively investigates the effectiveness of nine state-of-the-art LLMs in Android text-input generation for UI pages. We collected 114 UI pages from 62 open-source Android apps and extracted contextual information from the UI pages to construct prompts for LLMs to generate text inputs. The experimental results show that some LLMs can generate relatively more effective and higher-quality text inputs, achieving a 50.58% to 66.67% page-pass-through rate, and even detecting some real bugs in open-source apps. Compared with the GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 LLMs, other LLMs reduce the page-pass-through rates by 17.97% to 84.79% and 21.93% to 85.53%, respectively. We also found that using more complete UI contextual information can increase the page-pass-through rates of LLMs for generating text inputs. In addition, we also describe six insights gained regarding the use of LLMs for Android testing: These insights will benefit the Android testing community.</p></details> |  |

However, existing segmentation approaches face challenges due to the absence of pixel-level annotated datasets tailored for lymph nodes around the rectum. Additionally, metastatic lymph nodes are characterized by their relatively small size, irregular shapes, and lower contrast compared to the background, further complicating the segmentation task. To address these challenges, we present the first large-scale perirectal metastatic lymph node CT image dataset called Meply, which encompasses pixel-level annotations of 269 patients diagnosed with rectal cancer. Furthermore, we introduce a novel lymph-node segmentation model named CoSAM. The CoSAM utilizes sequence-based detection to guide the segmentation of metastatic lymph nodes in rectal cancer, contributing to improved localization performance for the segmentation model. It comprises three key components: sequence-based detection module, segmentation module, and collaborative convergence unit. To evaluate the effectiveness of CoSAM, we systematically compare its performance with several popular segmentation methods using the Meply dataset. Our code and dataset will be publicly available at: https://github.com/kanydao/CoSAM.</p></details> | 13 pages |

Existing studies, though have explored various aspects of VQA but somewhat ignored this particular attribute. This paper aims to bridge the research gap by contributing a comprehensive dataset, called UNK-VQA. The dataset is specifically designed to address the challenge of questions that models do not know. To this end, we first augment the existing data via deliberate perturbations on either the image or question. In specific, we carefully ensure that the question-image semantics remain close to the original unperturbed distribution. By this means, the identification of unanswerable questions becomes challenging, setting our dataset apart from others that involve mere image replacement. We then extensively evaluate the zero- and few-shot performance of several emerging multi-modal large models and discover their significant limitations when applied to our dataset. Additionally, we also propose a straightforward method to tackle these unanswerable questions. This dataset, we believe, will serve as a valuable benchmark for enhancing the abstention capability of VQA models, thereby leading to increased trustworthiness of AI systems. We have made the dataset (https://github.com/guoyang9/UNK-VQA) available to facilitate further exploration in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Distance Guided Alignment Training for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06390v2)** | 2024-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring alignment with human preferences is a crucial characteristic of large language models (LLMs). Presently, the primary alignment methods, RLHF and DPO, require extensive human annotation, which is expensive despite their efficacy. The significant expenses associated with current alignment techniques motivate researchers to investigate the development of annotation-free alignment training methods. In pursuit of improved alignment without relying on external annotation, we introduce Latent Distance Guided Alignment Training (LD-Align). This approach seeks to align the model with a high-quality supervised fine-tune dataset using guidance from a latent space. The latent space is generated through sample reconstruction, akin to auto-encoding. Consequently, we utilize the distance between sample pairs in the latent space to guide DPO-based alignment training. Extensive experimentation and evaluation show the efficacy of our proposed method in achieving notable alignment.</p></details> |  |

However, the limited availability of public electroencephalogram (EEG) data presents a unique challenge for extending the success of these models to EEG-based tasks. To address this gap, we propose AdaCT, plug-and-play Adapters designed for Converting Time series data into spatio-temporal 2D pseudo-images or text forms. Essentially, AdaCT-I transforms multi-channel or lengthy single-channel time series data into spatio-temporal 2D pseudo-images for fine-tuning pre-trained vision transformers, while AdaCT-T converts short single-channel data into text for fine-tuning pre-trained language transformers. The proposed approach allows for seamless integration of pre-trained vision models and language models in time series decoding tasks, particularly in EEG data analysis. Experimental results on diverse benchmark datasets, including Epileptic Seizure Recognition, Sleep-EDF, and UCI HAR, demonstrate the superiority of AdaCT over baseline methods. Overall, we provide a promising transfer learning framework for leveraging the capabilities of pre-trained vision and language models in EEG-based tasks, thereby advancing the field of time series decoding and enhancing interpretability in EEG data analysis.

A representative form of informal language is slang, used commonly in daily conversations and online social media. To date, slang has not been comprehensively evaluated in LLMs due partly to the absence of a carefully designed and publicly accessible benchmark. Using movie subtitles, we construct a dataset that supports evaluation on a diverse set of tasks pertaining to automatic processing of slang. For both evaluation and finetuning, we show the effectiveness of our dataset on two core applications: 1) slang detection, and 2) identification of regional and historical sources of slang from natural sentences. We also show how our dataset can be used to probe the output distributions of LLMs for interpretive insights. We find that while LLMs such as GPT-4 achieve good performance in a zero-shot setting, smaller BERT-like models finetuned on our dataset achieve comparable performance. Furthermore, we show that our dataset enables finetuning of LLMs such as GPT-3.5 that achieve substantially better performance than strong zero-shot baselines. Our work offers a comprehensive evaluation and a high-quality benchmark on English slang based on the OpenSubtitles corpus, serving both as a publicly accessible resource and a platform for applying tools for informal language processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2024 main conference</p></details> |

Despite the models only seeing text in training, several recent studies suggest that LLM representations implicitly capture aspects of the underlying grounded concepts. Here, we explore LLM representations of a particularly salient kind of grounded knowledge -- spatial relationships. We design natural-language navigation tasks and evaluate the ability of LLMs, in particular GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, and Llama2 series models, to represent and reason about spatial structures. These tasks reveal substantial variability in LLM performance across different spatial structures, including square, hexagonal, and triangular grids, rings, and trees. In extensive error analysis, we find that LLMs' mistakes reflect both spatial and non-spatial factors. These findings suggest that LLMs appear to capture certain aspects of spatial structure implicitly, but room for improvement remains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to TMLR 2024.

In this paper, we explore the application of speculative decoding to enhance the inference efficiency of MLLMs, specifically the LLaVA 7B model. We show that a language-only model can serve as a good draft model for speculative decoding with LLaVA 7B, bypassing the need for image tokens and their associated processing components from the draft model. Our experiments across three different tasks show that speculative decoding can achieve a memory-bound speedup of up to 2.37$\times$ using a 115M parameter language model that we trained from scratch. Additionally, we introduce a compact LLaVA draft model incorporating an image adapter, which shows marginal performance gains in image captioning while maintaining comparable results in other tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a spotlight paper to ELVM workshop at CVPR 2024</p></details> |

We examine the TCO and performance metrics of a domain-adaptive LLM, ChipNeMo, against two leading LLMs, Claude 3 Opus and ChatGPT-4 Turbo, to assess their efficacy in chip design coding generation. Through a detailed evaluation of the accuracy of the model, training methodologies, and operational expenditures, this study aims to provide stakeholders with critical information to select the most economically viable and performance-efficient solutions for their specific needs. Our results underscore the benefits of employing domain-adapted models, such as ChipNeMo, that demonstrate improved performance at significantly reduced costs compared to their general-purpose counterparts. In particular, we reveal the potential of domain-adapted LLMs to decrease TCO by approximately 90%-95%, with the cost advantages becoming increasingly evident as the deployment scale expands. With expansion of deployment, the cost benefits of ChipNeMo become more pronounced, making domain-adaptive LLMs an attractive option for organizations with substantial coding needs supported by LLMs</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a framework for adaptive prompt design called active transductive inference (ATI). We design the LLM prompt by adaptively choosing few-shot examples for a given inference query. The examples are initially unlabeled and we query the user to label the most informative ones, which maximally reduces the uncertainty in the LLM prediction. We propose two algorithms, GO and SAL, which differ in how the few-shot examples are chosen. We analyze these algorithms in linear models: first GO and then use its equivalence with SAL. We experiment with many different tasks and show that GO and SAL outperform other methods for choosing few-shot examples in the LLM prompt at inference time.</p></details> |  |

We propose to measure an answer's quality based on the degree to which it allows us to infer the initial question accurately. This conception of answer quality inherently reflects their relevance to initial questions. Drawing parallels with semantic search, we argue that this measurement approach can be operationalized by fine-tuning a large language model on the observed corpus of questions and answers without additional labeled data. We showcase our measurement approach within the context of the Question Period in the Canadian House of Commons. Our approach yields valuable insights into the correlates of the quality of answers in the Question Period. We find that answer quality varies significantly based on the party affiliation of the members of Parliament asking the questions and uncover a meaningful correlation between answer quality and the topics of the questions.</p></details> |  |

The language models in cross-device FL are relatively small, which can be trained with meaningful formal user-level differential privacy (DP) guarantees when massive parallelism in training is enabled by the participation of a moderate size of users. Recently, public data has been used to improve privacy-utility trade-offs for both large and small language models. In this work, we provide a systematic study of using large-scale public data and LLMs to help differentially private training of on-device FL models, and further improve the privacy-utility tradeoff by techniques of distillation. Moreover, we propose a novel distribution matching algorithm with theoretical grounding to sample public data close to private data distribution, which significantly improves the sample efficiency of (pre-)training on public data. The proposed method is efficient and effective for training private models by taking advantage of public data, especially for customized on-device architectures that do not have ready-to-use pre-trained models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at Findings of NAACL 2024</p></details> |

Addressing these concerns necessitates a comprehensive analysis of jailbreak prompts to evaluate LLMs' defensive capabilities and identify potential weaknesses. However, the complexity of evaluating jailbreak performance and understanding prompt characteristics makes this analysis laborious. We collaborate with domain experts to characterize problems and propose an LLM-assisted framework to streamline the analysis process. It provides automatic jailbreak assessment to facilitate performance evaluation and support analysis of components and keywords in prompts. Based on the framework, we design JailbreakLens, a visual analysis system that enables users to explore the jailbreak performance against the target model, conduct multi-level analysis of prompt characteristics, and refine prompt instances to verify findings. Through a case study, technical evaluations, and expert interviews, we demonstrate our system's effectiveness in helping users evaluate model security and identify model weaknesses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to VIS 2024</p></details> |

In recent years, the advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have introduced new possibilities for image segmentation. In this work, we delve into reasoning segmentation, a novel task that enables segmentation system to reason and interpret implicit user intention via large language model reasoning and then segment the corresponding target. Our work on reasoning segmentation contributes on both the methodological design and dataset labeling. For the model, we propose a new framework named LLM-Seg. LLM-Seg effectively connects the current foundational Segmentation Anything Model and the LLM by mask proposals selection.

Recent studies ameliorate the computational costs of LLMs by increasing their activation sparsity but suffer from significant performance degradation on downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce a new framework for sparsifying the activations of base LLMs and reducing inference costs, dubbed Contextually Aware Thresholding for Sparsity (CATS). CATS is relatively simple, easy to implement, and highly effective. At the heart of our framework is a new non-linear activation function. We demonstrate that CATS can be applied to various base models, including Mistral-7B and Llama2-7B, and outperforms existing sparsification techniques in downstream task performance. More precisely, CATS-based models often achieve downstream task performance within 1-2% of their base models without any fine-tuning and even at activation sparsity levels of 50%. Furthermore, CATS-based models converge faster and display better task performance than competing techniques when fine-tuning is applied. Finally, we develop a custom GPU kernel for efficient implementation of CATS that translates the activation of sparsity of CATS to real wall-clock time speedups. Our custom kernel implementation of CATS results in a ~15% improvement in wall-clock inference latency of token generation on both Llama-7B and Mistral-7B.</p></details> |  |

One solution is to use a retriever that fetches relevant information to expand LLM's knowledge scope. However, existing textual-oriented retrieval-based LLMs are not ideal on structured table data due to diversified data modalities and large table sizes. In this work, we propose OpenTab, an open-domain table reasoning framework powered by LLMs. Overall, OpenTab leverages table retriever to fetch relevant tables and then generates SQL programs to parse the retrieved tables efficiently. Utilizing the intermediate data derived from the SQL executions, it conducts grounded inference to produce accurate response.

LMMs typically use a fixed amount of visual tokens, such as the penultimate layer features in the CLIP visual encoder, as the prefix content. Recent LMMs incorporate more complex visual inputs, such as high-resolution images and videos, which increase the number of visual tokens significantly. However, due to the design of the Transformer architecture, computational costs associated with these models tend to increase quadratically with the number of input tokens. To tackle this problem, we explore a token reduction mechanism and find, similar to prior work, that many visual tokens are spatially redundant. Based on this, we propose PruMerge, a novel adaptive visual token reduction approach, which largely reduces the number of visual tokens while maintaining comparable model performance. We first select the unpruned visual tokens based on their similarity to class tokens and spatial tokens. We then cluster the pruned tokens based on key similarity and merge the clustered tokens with the unpruned tokens to supplement their information. Empirically, when applied to LLaVA-1.5, our approach can compress the visual tokens by 18 times on average, and achieve comparable performance across diverse visual question-answering and reasoning tasks.

While memory and run-time requirements hinder their applicability to large datasets, many low-rank kernel approximations, such as random Fourier features, were recently developed to scale up such kernel methods. However, these scalable approaches are based on approximations of isotropic kernels, which cannot remove the influence of irrelevant features. In this work, we design random Fourier features for a family of automatic relevance determination (ARD) kernels, and introduce RFFNet, a new large-scale kernel method that learns the kernel relevances' on the fly via first-order stochastic optimization. We present an effective initialization scheme for the method's non-convex objective function, evaluate if hard-thresholding RFFNet's learned relevances yield a sensible rule for variable selection, and perform an extensive ablation study of RFFNet's components. Numerical validation on simulated and real-world data shows that our approach has a small memory footprint and run-time, achieves low prediction error, and effectively identifies relevant features, thus leading to more interpretable solutions. We supply users with an efficient, PyTorch-based library, that adheres to the scikit-learn standard API and code for fully reproducing our results.</p></details> | <details><summary>New d...</summary><p>New datasets, ablation studies, and discussion of method's components. 45 pages, 11 figures</p></details> |

Traditional techniques, such as those based on geometry and matrix factorization, rely on assumptions about the data relations that become inadequate when handling large and complex graph data. On the other hand, deep learning approaches demonstrate promising results in handling large graph data, but they often fall short of providing interpretable explanations. To equip the graph processing with both high accuracy and explainability, we introduce a novel approach that harnesses the power of a large language model (LLM), enhanced by an uncertainty-aware module to provide a confidence score on the generated answer. We experiment with our approach on two graph processing tasks: few-shot knowledge graph completion and graph classification. Our results demonstrate that through parameter efficient fine-tuning, the LLM surpasses state-of-the-art algorithms by a substantial margin across ten diverse benchmark datasets. Moreover, to address the challenge of explainability, we propose an uncertainty estimation based on perturbation, along with a calibration scheme to quantify the confidence scores of the generated answers. Our confidence measure achieves an AUC of 0.8 or higher on seven out of the ten datasets in predicting the correctness of the answer generated by LLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Becau...</summary><p>Because my organization does not allow members to privately upload papers to arXiv, I am requesting a withdrawal of my submission</p></details> |

Nevertheless, the performance of general LMMs in specific domains is still far from satisfactory. This paper proposes FoodLMM, a versatile food assistant based on LMMs with various capabilities, including food recognition, ingredient recognition, recipe generation, nutrition estimation, food segmentation and multi-round conversation. To facilitate FoodLMM to deal with tasks beyond pure text output, we introduce a series of novel task-specific tokens and heads, enabling the model to predict food nutritional values and multiple segmentation masks. We adopt a two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, we utilize multiple public food benchmarks for multi-task learning by leveraging the instruct-following paradigm. In the second stage, we construct a multi-round conversation dataset and a reasoning segmentation dataset to fine-tune the model, enabling it to conduct professional dialogues and generate segmentation masks based on complex reasoning in the food domain. Our fine-tuned FoodLMM achieves state-of-the-art results across several food benchmarks. We will make our code, models and datasets publicly available.</p></details> |  |

A targeted test in Italian](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08488v1)** | 2024-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a test to perform Thematic Analysis (TA) with Large Language Model (LLM) on data which is in a different language than English. While there has been initial promising work on using pre-trained LLMs for TA on data in English, we lack any tests on whether these models can reasonably perform the same analysis with good quality in other language. In this paper a test will be proposed using an open access dataset of semi-structured interviews in Italian. The test shows that a pre-trained model can perform such a TA on the data, also using prompts in Italian. A comparative test shows the model capacity to produce themes which have a good resemblance with those produced independently by human researchers. The main implication of this study is that pre-trained LLMs may thus be suitable to support analysis in multilingual situations, so long as the language is supported by the model used.</p></details> |  |

However, the volume and complexity of these standards has increased over time, thus complicating access to relevant information for vendors and service providers.

In this paper, we evaluate the capability of state-of-art LLMs to be used as Question Answering (QA) assistants for 3GPP document reference. Our contribution is threefold. First, we provide a benchmark and measuring methods for evaluating performance of LLMs. Second, we do data preprocessing and fine-tuning for one of these LLMs and provide guidelines to increase accuracy of the responses that apply to all LLMs. Third, we provide a model of our own, TeleRoBERTa, that performs on-par with foundation LLMs but with an order of magnitude less number of parameters.

In this paper, we consider OTFS in an overspread channel exhibiting a delay spread that exceeds the block duration in a frame, where traditional channel estimation (CE) fails. We propose a two-stage CE method based on a delay-Doppler (DD) training frame, consisting of a dual chirp converted from time domain and a higher power pilot. The first stage employs a DD domain embedded pilot CE to estimate the aliased delays (due to modulo operation) and Doppler shifts, followed by identifying all the underspread paths not coinciding with any overspread path. The second stage utilizes time domain dual chirp correlation to estimate the actual delays and Doppler shifts of the remaining paths. This stage also resolves ambiguity in estimating delays and Doppler shifts for paths sharing same aliased delay. Furthermore, we present a modified low-complexity maximum ratio combining (MRC) detection algorithm for OTFS in overspread channels. Finally, we evaluate performance of OTFS using the proposed CE and the modified MRC detection in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) and bit error rate (BER).</p></details> |  |

The lack of human-annotated multi-modality aesthetic data further exacerbates this dilemma, resulting in MLLMs falling short of aesthetics perception capabilities. To address the above challenge, we first introduce a comprehensively annotated Aesthetic Multi-Modality Instruction Tuning (AesMMIT) dataset, which serves as the footstone for building multi-modality aesthetics foundation models. Specifically, to align MLLMs with human aesthetics perception, we construct a corpus-rich aesthetic critique database with 21,904 diverse-sourced images and 88K human natural language feedbacks, which are collected via progressive questions, ranging from coarse-grained aesthetic grades to fine-grained aesthetic descriptions. To ensure that MLLMs can handle diverse queries, we further prompt GPT to refine the aesthetic critiques and assemble the large-scale aesthetic instruction tuning dataset, i.e. AesMMIT, which consists of 409K multi-typed instructions to activate stronger aesthetic capabilities. Based on the AesMMIT database, we fine-tune the open-sourced general foundation models, achieving multi-modality Aesthetic Expert models, dubbed AesExpert. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed AesExpert models deliver significantly better aesthetic perception performances than the state-of-the-art MLLMs, including the most advanced GPT-4V and Gemini-Pro-Vision.

The rapid advances in FMs serve as an important contextual backdrop for the vision of next-generation wireless networks, where federated learning (FL) is a key enabler of distributed network intelligence. Currently, the exploration of the interplay between FMs and FL is still in its nascent stage. Naturally, FMs are capable of boosting the performance of FL, and FL could also leverage decentralized data and computing resources to assist in the training of FMs. However, the exceptionally high requirements that FMs have for computing resources, storage, and communication overhead would pose critical challenges to FL-enabled wireless networks. In this article, we explore the extent to which FMs are suitable for FL over wireless networks, including a broad overview of research challenges and opportunities. In particular, we discuss multiple new paradigms for realizing future intelligent networks that integrate FMs and FL. We also consolidate several broad research directions associated with these paradigms.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables.

Nevertheless, directly predicting the coordinates of objects in 3D space from monocular images poses challenges. Therefore, an effective solution involves transforming monocular images into LiDAR-like representations and employing a LiDAR-based 3D object detector to predict the 3D coordinates of objects. The key step in this method is accurately converting the monocular image into a reliable point cloud form. In this paper, we present VFMM3D, an innovative approach that leverages the capabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to accurately transform single-view images into LiDAR point cloud representations. VFMM3D utilizes the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Depth Anything Model (DAM) to generate high-quality pseudo-LiDAR data enriched with rich foreground information. Specifically, the Depth Anything Model (DAM) is employed to generate dense depth maps. Subsequently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is utilized to differentiate foreground and background regions by predicting instance masks. These predicted instance masks and depth maps are then combined and projected into 3D space to generate pseudo-LiDAR points. Finally, any object detectors based on point clouds can be utilized to predict the 3D coordinates of objects. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the challenging 3D object detection dataset KITTI. Our VFMM3D establishes a new state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, experimental results demonstrate the generality of VFMM3D, showcasing its seamless integration into various LiDAR-based 3D object detectors.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

This approach has proven crucial in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, the speech processing community lacks a similar setup to explore the paradigm systematically. In this work, we establish the Speech processing Universal PERformance Benchmark (SUPERB) to study the effectiveness of the paradigm for speech. We propose a unified multi-tasking framework to address speech processing tasks in SUPERB using a frozen foundation model followed by task-specialized, lightweight prediction heads. Combining our results with community submissions, we verify that the foundation model paradigm is promising for speech, and our multi-tasking framework is simple yet effective, as the best-performing foundation model shows competitive generalizability across most SUPERB tasks. For reproducibility and extensibility, we have developed a long-term maintained platform that enables deterministic benchmarking, allows for result sharing via an online leaderboard, and promotes collaboration through a community-driven benchmark database to support new development cycles. Finally, we conduct a series of analyses to offer an in-depth understanding of SUPERB and speech foundation models, including information flows across tasks inside the models, the correctness of the weighted-sum benchmarking protocol and the statistical significance and robustness of the benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>The e...</summary><p>The extended journal version for SUPERB and SUPERB-SG.

However, current methodologies often treat these two tasks as separate entities, thereby failing to leverage shared knowledge. Moreover, the complexity and diversity of remote sensing image scenes pose additional challenges, as most algorithms are designed to model individual small datasets, thus lacking cross-scene generalization. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive remote sensing image building understanding model, termed RSBuilding, developed from the perspective of the foundation model. RSBuilding is designed to enhance cross-scene generalization and task universality. Specifically, we extract image features based on the prior knowledge of the foundation model and devise a multi-level feature sampler to augment scale information. To unify task representation and integrate image spatiotemporal clues, we introduce a cross-attention decoder with task prompts. Addressing the current shortage of datasets that incorporate annotations for both tasks, we have developed a federated training strategy to facilitate smooth model convergence even when supervision for some tasks is missing, thereby bolstering the complementarity of different tasks. Our model was trained on a dataset comprising up to 245,000 images and validated on multiple building extraction and change detection datasets. The experimental results substantiate that RSBuilding can concurrently handle two structurally distinct tasks and exhibits robust zero-shot generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |

This approach has seen massive success for various kinds of data, e.g. images, language, audio, and holds the promise of improving performance in various downstream tasks (e.g. encoding or decoding brain data). However, there has been limited progress taking this approach for modelling brain signals, such as Magneto-/electroencephalography (M/EEG). Here we propose two classes of deep learning foundational models that can be trained using forecasting of unlabelled MEG. First, we consider a modified Wavenet; and second, we consider a modified Transformer-based (GPT2) model. The modified GPT2 includes a novel application of tokenisation and embedding methods, allowing a model developed initially for the discrete domain of language to be applied to continuous multichannel time series data. We also extend the forecasting framework to include condition labels as inputs, enabling better modelling (encoding) of task data. We compare the performance of these deep learning models with standard linear autoregressive (AR) modelling on MEG data. This shows that GPT2-based models provide better modelling capabilities than Wavenet and linear AR models, by better reproducing the temporal, spatial and spectral characteristics of real data and evoked activity in task data. We show how the GPT2 model scales well to multiple subjects, while adapting its model to each subject through subject embedding. Finally, we show how such a model can be useful in downstream decoding tasks through data simulation.

VFMs like CLIP, DINOv2, SAM are trained with distinct objectives, exhibiting unique characteristics for various downstream tasks. We find that despite their conceptual differences, these models can be effectively merged into a unified model through multi-teacher distillation. We name this approach AM-RADIO (Agglomerative Model -- Reduce All Domains Into One). This integrative approach not only surpasses the performance of individual teacher models but also amalgamates their distinctive features, such as zero-shot vision-language comprehension, detailed pixel-level understanding, and open vocabulary segmentation capabilities. In pursuit of the most hardware-efficient backbone, we evaluated numerous architectures in our multi-teacher distillation pipeline using the same training recipe. This led to the development of a novel architecture (E-RADIO) that exceeds the performance of its predecessors and is at least 7x faster than the teacher models.

Not only can recent models generalize to arbitrary images for their training task, their intermediate representations are useful for other visual tasks such as detection and segmentation. Given that such models can classify, delineate, and localize objects in 2D, we ask whether they also represent their 3D structure? In this work, we analyze the 3D awareness of visual foundation models. We posit that 3D awareness implies that representations (1) encode the 3D structure of the scene and (2) consistently represent the surface across views.

However, an attacker could perform data poisoning attacks by manipulating some support samples such that the classifier makes the attacker-desired, arbitrary prediction for a testing input. Empirical defenses cannot provide formal robustness guarantees, leading to a cat-and-mouse game between the attacker and defender. Existing certified defenses are designed for traditional supervised learning, resulting in sub-optimal performance when extended to few-shot classification. In our work, we propose FCert, the first certified defense against data poisoning attacks to few-shot classification. We show our FCert provably predicts the same label for a testing input under arbitrary data poisoning attacks when the total number of poisoned support samples is bounded. We perform extensive experiments on benchmark few-shot classification datasets with foundation models released by OpenAI, Meta, and Google in both vision and text domains. Our experimental results show our FCert: 1) maintains classification accuracy without attacks, 2) outperforms existing state-of-the-art certified defenses for data poisoning attacks, and 3) is efficient and general.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, 2024</p></details> |
| **[Lossy Image Compression with Foundation Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08580v1)** | 2024-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Incorporating diffusion models in the image compression domain has the potential to produce realistic and detailed reconstructions, especially at extremely low bitrates. Previous methods focus on using diffusion models as expressive decoders robust to quantization errors in the conditioning signals, yet achieving competitive results in this manner requires costly training of the diffusion model and long inference times due to the iterative generative process. In this work we formulate the removal of quantization error as a denoising task, using diffusion to recover lost information in the transmitted image latent. Our approach allows us to perform less than 10\% of the full diffusion generative process and requires no architectural changes to the diffusion model, enabling the use of foundation models as a strong prior without additional fine tuning of the backbone. Our proposed codec outperforms previous methods in quantitative realism metrics, and we verify that our reconstructions are qualitatively preferred by end users, even when other methods use twice the bitrate.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Foundation Models for Content-Based Medical Image Retrieval in Radiology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06567v2)** | 2024-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) has the potential to significantly improve diagnostic aid and medical research in radiology. Current CBIR systems face limitations due to their specialization to certain pathologies, limiting their utility. In response, we propose using vision foundation models as powerful and versatile off-the-shelf feature extractors for content-based medical image retrieval. By benchmarking these models on a comprehensive dataset of 1.6 million 2D radiological images spanning four modalities and 161 pathologies, we identify weakly-supervised models as superior, achieving a P@1 of up to 0.594. This performance not only competes with a specialized model but does so without the need for fine-tuning. Our analysis further explores the challenges in retrieving pathological versus anatomical structures, indicating that accurate retrieval of pathological features presents greater difficulty. Despite these challenges, our research underscores the vast potential of foundation models for CBIR in radiology, proposing a shift towards versatile, general-purpose medical image retrieval systems that do not require specific tuning.</p></details> |  |

Subsequent efforts have been made to introduce region-level visual learning into CLIP's pretraining but face scalability challenges due to the lack of large-scale region-level datasets. Drawing inspiration from supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in natural language processing such as instruction tuning, we explore the potential of fine-grained SFT in enhancing the generation of vision foundation models after their pretraining. Thus a two-stage method ViSFT (Vision SFT) is proposed to unleash the fine-grained knowledge of vision foundation models. In ViSFT, the vision foundation model is enhanced by performing visual joint learning on some in-domain tasks and then tested on out-of-domain benchmarks.

| **[Low-Resource Vision Challenges for Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04716v3)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-resource settings are well-established in natural language processing, where many languages lack sufficient data for deep learning at scale. However, low-resource problems are under-explored in computer vision. In this paper, we address this gap and explore the challenges of low-resource image tasks with vision foundation models. We first collect a benchmark of genuinely low-resource image data, covering historic maps, circuit diagrams, and mechanical drawings. These low-resource settings all share three challenges: data scarcity, fine-grained differences, and the distribution shift from natural images to the specialized domain of interest. While existing foundation models have shown impressive generalizability, we find they cannot transfer well to our low-resource tasks. To begin to tackle the challenges of low-resource vision, we introduce one simple baseline per challenge. Specifically, we i) enlarge the data space by generative models, ii) adopt the best sub-kernels to encode local regions for fine-grained difference discovery and iii) learn attention for specialized domains. Experiments on our three low-resource tasks demonstrate our proposals already provide a better baseline than transfer learning, data augmentation, and fine-grained methods. This highlights the unique characteristics and challenges of low-resource vision for foundation models that warrant further investigation.

In response to this challenge, this study introduces Me-LLaMA, a novel medical LLM family that includes foundation models - Me-LLaMA 13/70B, along with their chat-enhanced versions - Me-LLaMA 13/70B-chat, developed through continual pre-training and instruction tuning of LLaMA2 using large medical datasets. Our methodology leverages a comprehensive domain-specific data suite, including a large-scale, continual pre-training dataset with 129B tokens, an instruction tuning dataset with 214k samples, and a new medical evaluation benchmark (MIBE) across six critical medical tasks with 12 datasets. Our extensive evaluation using the MIBE shows that Me-LLaMA models achieve overall better performance than existing open-source medical LLMs in zero-shot, few-shot and supervised learning abilities. With task-specific instruction tuning, Me-LLaMA models outperform ChatGPT on 7 out of 8 datasets and GPT-4 on 5 out of 8 datasets. In addition, we investigated the catastrophic forgetting problem, and our results show that Me-LLaMA models outperform other open-source medical LLMs in mitigating this issue. Me-LLaMA is one of the largest open-source medical foundation LLMs that use both biomedical and clinical data.

Therefore, we propose a method based on foundation models and zero training to solve the tasks of photoacoustic (PA) image segmentation. We employed the segment anything model (SAM) by setting simple prompts and integrating the model's outputs with prior knowledge of the imaged objects to accomplish various tasks, including: (1) removing the skin signal in three-dimensional PA image rendering; (2) dual speed-of-sound reconstruction, and (3) segmentation of finger blood vessels. Through these demonstrations, we have concluded that deep learning can be directly applied in PA imaging without the requirement for network design and training. This potentially allows for a hands-on, convenient approach to achieving efficient and accurate segmentation of PA images. This letter serves as a comprehensive tutorial, facilitating the mastery of the technique through the provision of code and sample datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measuring Geographic Diversity of Foundation Models with a Natural Language--based Geo-guessing Experiment on GPT-4](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07612v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI based on foundation models provides a first glimpse into the world represented by machines trained on vast amounts of multimodal data ingested by these models during training. If we consider the resulting models as knowledge bases in their own right, this may open up new avenues for understanding places through the lens of machines. In this work, we adopt this thinking and select GPT-4, a state-of-the-art representative in the family of multimodal large language models, to study its geographic diversity regarding how well geographic features are represented. Using DBpedia abstracts as a ground-truth corpus for probing, our natural language--based geo-guessing experiment shows that GPT-4 may currently encode insufficient knowledge about several geographic feature types on a global level. On a local level, we observe not only this insufficiency but also inter-regional disparities in GPT-4's geo-guessing performance on UNESCO World Heritage Sites that carry significance to both local and global populations, and the inter-regional disparities may become smaller as the geographic scale increases. Morever, whether assessing the geo-guessing performance on a global or local level, we find inter-model disparities in GPT-4's geo-guessing performance when comparing its unimodal and multimodal variants. We hope this work can initiate a discussion on geographic diversity as an ethical principle within the GIScience community in the face of global socio-technical challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Short...</summary><p>Short paper accepted by AGILE 2024 conference (https://agile-gi.eu/conference-2024)</p></details> |

Industrial metaverses not only visualize the process of productivity in a dynamic and evolutional way, but also provide an immersive laboratory experimental environment for optimizing and remodeling the process. Besides, the customized user needs that are hidden in social media data can be discovered by social computing technologies, which introduces an input channel for building the whole social manufacturing process including industrial metaverses. This makes the fusion of multi-source data cross Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS) the foundational and key challenge. This work firstly proposes a multi-source-data-fusion-driven operational architecture for industrial metaverses on the basis of conducting a comprehensive literature review on the state-of-the-art multi-source data fusion methods. The advantages and disadvantages of each type of method are analyzed by considering the fusion mechanisms and application scenarios. Especially, we combine the strengths of deep learning and knowledge graphs in scalability and parallel computation to enable our proposed framework the ability of prescriptive optimization and evolution. This integration can address the shortcomings of deep learning in terms of explainability and fact fabrication, as well as overcoming the incompleteness and the challenges of construction and maintenance inherent in knowledge graphs. The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is validated through a parallel weaving case study. In the end, we discuss the challenges and future directions of multi-source data fusion cross CPSS for industrial metaverses and social manufacturing in Industries 5.0.</p></details> |  |

Robot applications today are created mostly using manual programming, mathematical models, planning frameworks, and reinforcement learning. These methods do not lead to the leaps in performance and generality seen with deep learning, generative AI, and foundation models (FMs). Furthermore, most FMs do not learn by sensing and acting in the world. They do not learn to experiment or collaborate. They do not learn from others or teach others like people and animals do. Consequently, today's autonomous robots do not learn to provide home care, to be nursing assistants, or to do other service applications. Robots could be better and human compatible. This requires creating a path to get there.</p></details> | 12 pages |

However, the conventional systems primarily focus on delivering diagnostic results through text report generation or medical image classification, positioning them as standalone decision-makers rather than helpers and ignoring radiologists' expertise. This study introduces an innovative paradigm to create an assistive co-pilot system for empowering radiologists by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and medical image analysis tools. Specifically, we develop a collaborative framework to integrate LLMs and quantitative medical image analysis results generated by foundation models with radiologists in the loop, achieving efficient and safe generation of radiology reports and effective utilization of computational power of AI and the expertise of medical professionals. This approach empowers radiologists to generate more precise and detailed diagnostic reports, enhancing patient outcomes while reducing the burnout of clinicians. Our methodology underscores the potential of AI as a supportive tool in medical diagnostics, promoting a harmonious integration of technology and human expertise to advance the field of radiology.</p></details> |  |

Segment-Anything(SAM), among others, is the state-of-the-art image segmentation foundation model demonstrating strong zero/few-shot generalization. Despite the success, recent studies reveal the weakness of SAM under strong distribution shift. In particular, SAM performs awkwardly on corrupted natural images, camouflaged images, medical images, etc. Motivated by the observations, we aim to develop a self-training based strategy to adapt SAM to target distribution. Given the unique challenges of large source dataset, high computation cost and incorrect pseudo label, we propose a weakly supervised self-training architecture with anchor regularization and low-rank finetuning to improve the robustness and computation efficiency of adaptation. We validate the effectiveness on 5 types of downstream segmentation tasks including natural clean/corrupted images, medical images, camouflaged images and robotic images. Our proposed method is task-agnostic in nature and outperforms pre-trained SAM and state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods on almost all downstream tasks with the same testing prompt inputs.</p></details> | 20 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Towards Foundation Models for Knowledge Graph Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04562v2)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models in language and vision have the ability to run inference on any textual and visual inputs thanks to the transferable representations such as a vocabulary of tokens in language. Knowledge graphs (KGs) have different entity and relation vocabularies that generally do not overlap. The key challenge of designing foundation models on KGs is to learn such transferable representations that enable inference on any graph with arbitrary entity and relation vocabularies. In this work, we make a step towards such foundation models and present ULTRA, an approach for learning universal and transferable graph representations. ULTRA builds relational representations as a function conditioned on their interactions. Such a conditioning strategy allows a pre-trained ULTRA model to inductively generalize to any unseen KG with any relation vocabulary and to be fine-tuned on any graph. Conducting link prediction experiments on 57 different KGs, we find that the zero-shot inductive inference performance of a single pre-trained ULTRA model on unseen graphs of various sizes is often on par or better than strong baselines trained on specific graphs. Fine-tuning further boosts the performance.</p></details> | ICLR 2024 |
| **[Playing to Vision Foundation Model's Strengths in Stereo Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06261v1)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stereo matching has become a key technique for 3D environment perception in intelligent vehicles. For a considerable time, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have remained the mainstream choice for feature extraction in this domain. Nonetheless, there is a growing consensus that the existing paradigm should evolve towards vision foundation models (VFM), particularly those developed based on vision Transformers (ViTs) and pre-trained through self-supervision on extensive, unlabeled datasets. While VFMs are adept at extracting informative, general-purpose visual features, specifically for dense prediction tasks, their performance often lacks in geometric vision tasks. This study serves as the first exploration of a viable approach for adapting VFMs to stereo matching. Our ViT adapter, referred to as ViTAS, is constructed upon three types of modules: spatial differentiation, patch attention fusion, and cross-attention. The first module initializes feature pyramids, while the latter two aggregate stereo and multi-scale contextual information into fine-grained features, respectively. ViTAStereo, which combines ViTAS with cost volume-based stereo matching back-end processes, achieves the top rank on the KITTI Stereo 2012 dataset and outperforms the second-best network StereoBase by approximately 7.9% in terms of the percentage of error pixels, with a tolerance of 3 pixels. Additional experiments across diverse scenarios further demonstrate its superior generalizability compared to all other state-of-the-art approaches. We believe this new paradigm will pave the way for the next generation of stereo matching networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Feature Re-Embedding: Towards Foundation Model-Level Performance in Computational Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17228v3)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) is the most widely used framework in computational pathology, encompassing sub-typing, diagnosis, prognosis, and more. However, the existing MIL paradigm typically requires an offline instance feature extractor, such as a pre-trained ResNet or a foundation model. This approach lacks the capability for feature fine-tuning within the specific downstream tasks, limiting its adaptability and performance. To address this issue, we propose a Re-embedded Regional Transformer (R$^2$T) for re-embedding the instance features online, which captures fine-grained local features and establishes connections across different regions. Unlike existing works that focus on pre-training powerful feature extractor or designing sophisticated instance aggregator, R$^2$T is tailored to re-embed instance features online. It serves as a portable module that can seamlessly integrate into mainstream MIL models. Extensive experimental results on common computational pathology tasks validate that: 1) feature re-embedding improves the performance of MIL models based on ResNet-50 features to the level of foundation model features, and further enhances the performance of foundation model features; 2) the R$^2$T can introduce more significant performance improvements to various MIL models; 3) R$^2$T-MIL, as an R$^2$T-enhanced AB-MIL, outperforms other latest methods by a large margin.The code is available at: https://github.com/DearCaat/RRT-MIL.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2024 |

While research in Deepfake detection has grown rapidly in response, many detection methods struggle with unseen Deepfakes generated by new synthesis techniques. To address this generalisation challenge, we propose a novel Deepfake detection approach by adapting rich information encoded inside the Foundation Models with rich information encoded inside, specifically using the image encoder from CLIP which has demonstrated strong zero-shot capability for downstream tasks. Inspired by the recent advances of parameter efficient fine-tuning, we propose a novel side-network-based decoder to extract spatial and temporal cues from the given video clip, with the promotion of the Facial Component Guidance (FCG) to guidencourage the spatial feature to include features of key facial parts for more robust and general Deepfake detection. Through extensive cross-dataset evaluations, our approach exhibits superior effectiveness in identifying unseen Deepfake samples, achieving notable performance improvementsuccess even with limited training samples and manipulation types. Our model secures an average performance enhancement of 0.9% AUROC in cross-dataset assessments comparing with state-of-the-art methods, especiallytablishing a significant lead of achieving 4.4% improvement on the challenging DFDC dataset.</p></details> |  |

Yet, challenges persist, including generalization across scenarios, maintaining reliability, and ensuring real-time responsiveness. This paper introduces a perception framework grounded in foundation models for universal object detection and tracking, moving beyond specific training categories. Integral to our approach is a multi-layered tracker integrated with the foundation detector, ensuring continuous target visibility, even when faced with motion blur, abrupt light shifts, and occlusions. Complementing this, we introduce a model-free controller tailored for resilient quadrotor visual tracking. Our system operates efficiently on limited hardware, relying solely on an onboard camera and an inertial measurement unit. Through extensive validation in diverse challenging indoor and outdoor environments, we demonstrate our system's effectiveness and adaptability. In conclusion, our research represents a step forward in quadrotor visual tracking, moving from task-specific methods to more versatile and adaptable operations.</p></details> |  |

However, clinical adoption of computational models has been hampered by the lack of generalization due to large batch effects, small dataset sizes, and poor performance in transfer learning from natural images. To address these challenges, we introduce DinoBloom, the first foundation model for single cell images in hematology, utilizing a tailored DINOv2 pipeline. Our model is built upon an extensive collection of 13 diverse, publicly available datasets of peripheral blood and bone marrow smears, the most substantial open-source cohort in hematology so far, comprising over 380,000 white blood cell images. To assess its generalization capability, we evaluate it on an external dataset with a challenging domain shift. We show that our model outperforms existing medical and non-medical vision models in (i) linear probing and k-nearest neighbor evaluations for cell-type classification on blood and bone marrow smears and (ii) weakly supervised multiple instance learning for acute myeloid leukemia subtyping by a large margin. A family of four DinoBloom models (small, base, large, and giant) can be adapted for a wide range of downstream applications, be a strong baseline for classification problems, and facilitate the assessment of batch effects in new datasets.

Temperature Network Meets Large Foundation Models via DRO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04575v1)** | 2024-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The temperature parameter plays a profound role during training and/or inference with large foundation models (LFMs) such as large language models (LLMs) and CLIP models. Particularly, it adjusts the logits in the softmax function in LLMs, which is crucial for next token generation, and it scales the similarities in the contrastive loss for training CLIP models. A significant question remains: Is it viable to learn a neural network to predict a personalized temperature of any input data for enhancing LFMs"? In this paper, we present a principled framework for learning a small yet generalizable temperature prediction network (TempNet) to improve LFMs. Our solution is composed of a novel learning framework with a robust loss underpinned by constrained distributionally robust optimization (DRO), and a properly designed TempNet with theoretical inspiration. TempNet can be trained together with a large foundation model from scratch or learned separately given a pretrained foundation model. It is not only useful for predicting personalized temperature to promote the training of LFMs but also generalizable and transferable to new tasks. Our experiments on LLMs and CLIP models demonstrate that TempNet greatly improves the performance of existing solutions or models, e.g. Table 1.

For example, a recent study found them useful for planning problems: plan generation, language translation, model construction, multi-agent planning, interactive planning, heuristics optimization, tool integration, and brain-inspired planning. Besides APS, there are many seemingly related tasks involving the generation of a series of actions with varying guarantees of their executability to achieve intended goals, which we collectively call planning-like (PL) tasks like business processes, programs, workflows, and guidelines, where researchers have considered using FMs. However, previous works have primarily focused on pre-trained, off-the-shelf FMs and optionally fine-tuned them. This paper discusses the need for a comprehensive FM for PL tasks from scratch and explores its design considerations. We argue that such an FM will open new and efficient avenues for PL problem-solving, just like LLMs are creating for APS.</p></details> |  |

Foundation models include large language models (LLMs) that show promising performance on a range of diverse tasks unrelated to their training. We show that these models are highly applicable to the data discovery and data exploration domain. When carefully used, they have superior capability on three representative tasks: table-class detection, column-type annotation and join-column prediction. On all three tasks, we show that a foundation-model-based approach outperforms the task-specific models and so the state of the art. Further, our approach often surpasses human-expert task performance. We investigate the fundamental characteristics of this approach including generalizability to several foundation models and the impact of non-determinism on the outputs. All in all, this suggests a future direction in which disparate data management tasks can be unified under foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in VLDB 2024</p></details> |

Organizations increasingly face such threats in an evolving cyber threat landscape. Understanding and establishing foundations for cyber resilience provide a quantitative and systematic approach to cyber risk assessment, mitigation policy evaluation, and risk-informed defense design. A systems-scientific view toward cyber risks provides holistic and system-level solutions. This chapter starts with a systemic view toward cyber risks and presents the confluence of game theory, control theory, and learning theories, which are three major pillars for the design of cyber resilience mechanisms to counteract increasingly sophisticated and evolving threats in our networks and organizations. Game and control theoretic methods provide a set of modeling frameworks to capture the strategic and dynamic interactions between defenders and attackers. Control and learning frameworks together provide a feedback-driven mechanism that enables autonomous and adaptive responses to threats. Game and learning frameworks offer a data-driven approach to proactively reason about adversarial behaviors and resilient strategies. The confluence of the three lays the theoretical foundations for the analysis and design of cyber resilience. This chapter presents various theoretical paradigms, including dynamic asymmetric games, moving horizon control, conjectural learning, and meta-learning, as recent advances at the intersection. This chapter concludes with future directions and discussions of the role of neurosymbolic learning and the synergy between foundation models and game models in cyber resilience.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bootstrapping SparseFormers from Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01987v2)** | 2024-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently proposed SparseFormer architecture provides an alternative approach to visual understanding by utilizing a significantly lower number of visual tokens via adjusting RoIs, greatly reducing computational costs while still achieving promising performance. However, training SparseFormers from scratch is still expensive, and scaling up the number of parameters can be challenging. In this paper, we propose to bootstrap SparseFormers from ViT-based vision foundation models in a simple and efficient way. Since the majority of SparseFormer blocks are the standard transformer ones, we can inherit weights from large-scale pre-trained vision transformers and freeze them as much as possible. Therefore, we only need to train the SparseFormer-specific lightweight focusing transformer to adjust token RoIs and fine-tune a few early pre-trained blocks to align the final token representation. In such a way, we can bootstrap SparseFormer architectures from various large-scale pre-trained models (e.g., IN-21K pre-trained AugRegs or CLIPs) using a rather smaller amount of training samples (e.g., IN-1K) and without labels or captions within just a few hours. As a result, the bootstrapped unimodal SparseFormer (from AugReg-ViT-L/16-384) can reach 84.9% accuracy on IN-1K with only 49 tokens, and the multimodal SparseFormer from CLIPs also demonstrates notable zero-shot performance with highly reduced computational cost without seeing any caption during the bootstrapping procedure. In addition, CLIP-bootstrapped SparseFormers, which align the output space with language without seeing a word, can serve as efficient vision encoders in multimodal large language models.

It promotes the development of healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) models, breaking the contradiction between limited AI models and diverse healthcare practices. Much more widespread healthcare scenarios will benefit from the development of a healthcare foundation model (HFM), improving their advanced intelligent healthcare services. Despite the impending widespread deployment of HFMs, there is currently a lack of clear understanding about how they work in the healthcare field, their current challenges, and where they are headed in the future. To answer these questions, a comprehensive and deep survey of the challenges, opportunities, and future directions of HFMs is presented in this survey. It first conducted a comprehensive overview of the HFM including the methods, data, and applications for a quick grasp of the current progress. Then, it made an in-depth exploration of the challenges present in data, algorithms, and computing infrastructures for constructing and widespread application of foundation models in healthcare. This survey also identifies emerging and promising directions in this field for future development. We believe that this survey will enhance the community's comprehension of the current progress of HFM and serve as a valuable source of guidance for future development in this field.

However, current state-of-the-art models employ spatio-temporal transformers trained on limited amounts of data, hindering generalizability adaptation to downstream tasks. The benefits of vision foundation models present a potential solution to improve the VSP process. However, adapting image foundation models to the video domain presents significant challenges in modeling scene dynamics and capturing temporal information. To address these challenges, and as the first initiative to design a VSP model based on video foundation models, we introduce SalFoM, a novel encoder-decoder video transformer architecture. Our model employs UnMasked Teacher (UMT) as feature extractor and presents a heterogeneous decoder which features a locality-aware spatio-temporal transformer and integrates local and global spatio-temporal information from various perspectives to produce the final saliency map. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments on the challenging VSP benchmark datasets of DHF1K, Hollywood-2 and UCF-Sports demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |

Zero-shot object 6D pose estimation methods address this challenge by leveraging additional task-specific supervision provided by large-scale, photo-realistic synthetic datasets. However, their performance heavily depends on the quality and diversity of rendered data and they require extensive training. In this work, we show how to tackle the same task but without training on specific data. We propose FreeZe, a novel solution that harnesses the capabilities of pre-trained geometric and vision foundation models. FreeZe leverages 3D geometric descriptors learned from unrelated 3D point clouds and 2D visual features learned from web-scale 2D images to generate discriminative 3D point-level descriptors. We then estimate the 6D pose of unseen objects by 3D registration based on RANSAC. We also introduce a novel algorithm to solve ambiguous cases due to geometrically symmetric objects that is based on visual features. We comprehensively evaluate FreeZe across the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark, which include over a hundred 3D objects and 20,000 images captured in various scenarios. FreeZe consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches, including competitors extensively trained on synthetic 6D pose estimation data.

In this paper, we propose for the first time the use of Transformer neural networks, with a Masked Auto-Encoder architecture, as Foundation Models for SHM. We demonstrate the ability of these models to learn generalizable representations from multiple large datasets through self-supervised pre-training, which, coupled with task-specific fine-tuning, allows them to outperform state-of-the-art traditional methods on diverse tasks, including Anomaly Detection (AD) and Traffic Load Estimation (TLE). We then extensively explore model size versus accuracy trade-offs and experiment with Knowledge Distillation (KD) to improve the performance of smaller Transformers, enabling their embedding directly into the SHM edge nodes. We showcase the effectiveness of our foundation models using data from three operational viaducts. For AD, we achieve a near-perfect 99.9% accuracy with a monitoring time span of just 15 windows. In contrast, a state-of-the-art method based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) obtains its first good result (95.03% accuracy) only considering 120 windows. On two different TLE tasks, our models obtain state-of-the-art performance on multiple evaluation metrics (R$^2$ score, MAE% and MSE%). On the first benchmark, we achieve an R$^2$ score of 0.97 and 0.85 for light and heavy vehicle traffic, respectively, while the best previous approach stops at 0.91 and 0.84.

A case study is presented featuring a vehicle classification application using acoustic and seismic sensing. The work is motivated by the success of foundation models in the areas of natural language processing and computer vision, leading to generalizations of the FM concept to other domains as well, where significant amounts of unlabeled data exist that can be used for self-supervised pre-training. One such domain is IoT applications. Foundation models for selected sensing modalities in the IoT domain can be pre-trained in an environment-agnostic fashion using available unlabeled sensor data and then fine-tuned to the deployment at hand using a small amount of labeled data. The paper shows that the pre-training/fine-tuning approach improves the robustness of downstream inference and facilitates adaptation to different environmental conditions. More specifically, we present a case study in a real-world setting to evaluate a simple (vibration-based) FM-like model, called FOCAL, demonstrating its superior robustness and adaptation, compared to conventional supervised deep neural networks (DNNs). We also demonstrate its superior convergence over supervised solutions. Our findings highlight the advantages of vibration-based FMs (and FM-inspired selfsupervised models in general) in terms of inference robustness, runtime efficiency, and model adaptation (via fine-tuning) in resource-limited IoT settings.</p></details> |  |

Foundation model based agents derive their autonomy from the capabilities of foundation models, which enable them to autonomously break down a given goal into a set of manageable tasks and orchestrate task execution to meet the goal. Despite the huge efforts put into building foundation model based agents, the architecture design of the agents has not yet been systematically explored. Also, while there are significant benefits of using agents for planning and execution, there are serious considerations regarding responsible AI related software quality attributes, such as security and accountability. Therefore, this paper presents a pattern-oriented reference architecture that serves as guidance when designing foundation model based agents. We evaluate the completeness and utility of the proposed reference architecture by mapping it to the architecture of two real-world agents.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, it requires a delicate integration of controller and estimator designs to achieve the desired system behavior. To establish a general controller synthesis framework, we explore the Decision Transformer (DT) architecture. Specifically, we first frame the control task as predicting the current optimal action based on past observations, actions, and rewards, eliminating the need for a separate estimator design. Then, we leverage the pre-trained language models, i.e., the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) series, to initialize DT and subsequently train it for control tasks using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Our comprehensive experiments across five distinct control tasks, ranging from maneuvering aerospace systems to controlling partial differential equations (PDEs), demonstrate DT's capability to capture the parameter-agnostic structures intrinsic to control tasks. DT exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization abilities for completely new tasks and rapidly surpasses expert performance levels with a minimal amount of demonstration data. These findings highlight the potential of DT as a foundational controller for general control applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to CDC 2024</p></details> |

In this study, we explore the adaptation of these models for few-shot semantic segmentation. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of four prominent foundation models: DINO V2, Segment Anything, CLIP, Masked AutoEncoders, and of a straightforward ResNet50 pre-trained on the COCO dataset. We also include 5 adaptation methods, ranging from linear probing to fine tuning. Our findings show that DINO V2 outperforms other models by a large margin, across various datasets and adaptation methods. On the other hand, adaptation methods provide little discrepancy in the obtained results, suggesting that a simple linear probing can compete with advanced, more computationally intensive, alternatives</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-shot Safety Prediction for Autonomous Robots with Foundation World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00462v2)** | 2024-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A world model creates a surrogate world to train a controller and predict safety violations by learning the internal dynamic model of systems. However, the existing world models rely solely on statistical learning of how observations change in response to actions, lacking precise quantification of how accurate the surrogate dynamics are, which poses a significant challenge in safety-critical systems. To address this challenge, we propose foundation world models that embed observations into meaningful and causally latent representations. This enables the surrogate dynamics to directly predict causal future states by leveraging a training-free large language model. In two common benchmarks, this novel model outperforms standard world models in the safety prediction task and has a performance comparable to supervised learning despite not using any data. We evaluate its performance with a more specialized and system-relevant metric by comparing estimated states instead of aggregating observation-wide error.</p></details> |  |

But do their capabilities change depending on the input modality? In this work, we propose $\textbf{IsoBench}$, a benchmark dataset containing problems from four major areas: math, science, algorithms, and games. Each example is presented with multiple $\textbf{isomorphic representations}$ of inputs, such as visual, textual, and mathematical presentations. IsoBench provides fine-grained feedback to diagnose performance gaps caused by the form of the representation. Across various foundation models, we observe that on the same problem, models have a consistent preference towards textual representations. Most prominently, when evaluated on all IsoBench problems, Claude-3 Opus performs 28.7 points worse when provided with images instead of text; similarly, GPT-4 Turbo is 18.7 points worse and Gemini Pro is 14.9 points worse. Finally, we present two prompting techniques, $\textit{IsoCombination}$ and $\textit{IsoScratchPad}$, which improve model performance by considering combinations of, and translations between, different input representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation Models for Time Series Analysis: A Tutorial and Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14735v2)** | 2024-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis stands as a focal point within the data mining community, serving as a cornerstone for extracting valuable insights crucial to a myriad of real-world applications. Recent advancements in Foundation Models (FMs) have fundamentally reshaped the paradigm of model design for time series analysis, boosting various downstream tasks in practice. These innovative approaches often leverage pre-trained or fine-tuned FMs to harness generalized knowledge tailored specifically for time series analysis. In this survey, we aim to furnish a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of FMs for time series analysis. While prior surveys have predominantly focused on either the application or the pipeline aspects of FMs in time series analysis, they have often lacked an in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanisms that elucidate why and how FMs benefit time series analysis. To address this gap, our survey adopts a model-centric classification, delineating various pivotal elements of time-series FMs, including model architectures, pre-training techniques, adaptation methods, and data modalities. Overall, this survey serves to consolidate the latest advancements in FMs pertinent to time series analysis, accentuating their theoretical underpinnings, recent strides in development, and avenues for future research exploration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantifying Self-diagnostic Atomic Knowledge in Chinese Medical Foundation Model: A Computational Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11722v3)** | 2024-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation Models (FMs) have the potential to revolutionize the way users self-diagnose through search engines by offering direct and efficient suggestions. Recent studies primarily focused on the quality of FMs evaluated by GPT-4 or their ability to pass medical exams, no studies have quantified the extent of self-diagnostic atomic knowledge stored in FMs' memory, which is the basis of foundation models to provide factual and reliable suggestions. In this paper, we first constructed a benchmark of Self-diagnostic Atomic Knowledge (SdAK), including the most common types of atomic knowledge involved in self-diagnostic queries, with 17 atomic types and a total of 14, 048 pieces of atomic knowledge. Then, we evaluated both generic and open-source Chinese medical FMs on the benchmark. The experimental results showcase that generic FMs perform better than medical FMs in terms of self-diagnostic atomic knowledge. Error analysis revealed that both generic and medical FMs are sycophantic, e.g., always catering to users' claims when it comes to unknown knowledge. We further explored different types of data commonly adopted for fine-tuning medical FMs, i.e., real-world, semi-distilled, and distilled data, and found that distilled data can benefit FMs most.

The emergence of foundation models (FMs) offers potential solutions to the limitations of existing FL frameworks, e.g., by generating synthetic data for model initialization. However, due to the inherent safety concerns of FMs, integrating FMs into FL could introduce new risks, which remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we conduct the first investigation on the vulnerability of FM integrated FL (FM-FL) under adversarial threats. Based on a unified framework of FM-FL, we introduce a novel attack strategy that exploits safety issues of FM to compromise FL client models. Through extensive experiments with well-known models and benchmark datasets in both image and text domains, we reveal the high susceptibility of the FM-FL to this new threat under various FL configurations. Furthermore, we find that existing FL defense strategies offer limited protection against this novel attack approach. This research highlights the critical need for enhanced security measures in FL in the era of FMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Chen ...</summary><p>Chen Wu and Xi Li are equal contribution.

| **[Predicting the Performance of Foundation Models via Agreement-on-the-Line](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01542v1)** | 2024-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the out-of-distribution performance in regimes where labels are scarce is critical to safely deploy foundation models. Recently, it was shown that ensembles of neural networks observe the phenomena ``agreement-on-the-line'', which can be leveraged to reliably predict OOD performance without labels. However, in contrast to classical neural networks that are trained on in-distribution data from scratch for numerous epochs, foundation models undergo minimal finetuning from heavily pretrained weights, which may reduce the ensemble diversity needed to observe agreement-on-the-line. In our work, we demonstrate that when lightly finetuning multiple runs from a $\textit{single}$ foundation model, the choice of randomness during training (linear head initialization, data ordering, and data subsetting) can lead to drastically different levels of agreement-on-the-line in the resulting ensemble. Surprisingly, only random head initialization is able to reliably induce agreement-on-the-line in finetuned foundation models across vision and language benchmarks. Second, we demonstrate that ensembles of $\textit{multiple}$ foundation models pretrained on different datasets but finetuned on the same task can also show agreement-on-the-line. In total, by careful construction of a diverse ensemble, we can utilize agreement-on-the-line-based methods to predict the OOD performance of foundation models with high precision.</p></details> |  |

Unlike current general-purpose foundation models that are stuck in the dilemma of inferior quality and text-image misalignment for humans, CosmicMan enables generating photo-realistic human images with meticulous appearance, reasonable structure, and precise text-image alignment with detailed dense descriptions. At the heart of CosmicMan's success are the new reflections and perspectives on data and models: (1) We found that data quality and a scalable data production flow are essential for the final results from trained models. Hence, we propose a new data production paradigm, Annotate Anyone, which serves as a perpetual data flywheel to produce high-quality data with accurate yet cost-effective annotations over time. Based on this, we constructed a large-scale dataset, CosmicMan-HQ 1.0, with 6 Million high-quality real-world human images in a mean resolution of 1488x1255, and attached with precise text annotations deriving from 115 Million attributes in diverse granularities. (2) We argue that a text-to-image foundation model specialized for humans must be pragmatic -- easy to integrate into down-streaming tasks while effective in producing high-quality human images. Hence, we propose to model the relationship between dense text descriptions and image pixels in a decomposed manner, and present Decomposed-Attention-Refocusing (Daring) training framework. It seamlessly decomposes the cross-attention features in existing text-to-image diffusion model, and enforces attention refocusing without adding extra modules. Through Daring, we show that explicitly discretizing continuous text space into several basic groups that align with human body structure is the key to tackling the misalignment problem in a breeze.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024.

| **[Bridging Remote Sensors with Multisensor Geospatial Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01260v1)** | 2024-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of geospatial analysis, the diversity of remote sensors, encompassing both optical and microwave technologies, offers a wealth of distinct observational capabilities. Recognizing this, we present msGFM, a multisensor geospatial foundation model that effectively unifies data from four key sensor modalities. This integration spans an expansive dataset of two million multisensor images. msGFM is uniquely adept at handling both paired and unpaired sensor data. For data originating from identical geolocations, our model employs an innovative cross-sensor pretraining approach in masked image modeling, enabling the synthesis of joint representations from diverse sensors. msGFM, incorporating four remote sensors, upholds strong performance, forming a comprehensive model adaptable to various sensor types. msGFM has demonstrated enhanced proficiency in a range of both single-sensor and multisensor downstream tasks. These include scene classification, segmentation, cloud removal, and pan-sharpening. A key discovery of our research is that representations derived from natural images are not always compatible with the distinct characteristics of geospatial remote sensors, underscoring the limitations of existing representations in this field. Our work can serve as a guide for developing multisensor geospatial pretraining models, paving the way for more advanced geospatial capabilities.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR |
| **[Asymmetric Masked Distillation for Pre-Training Small Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03149v2)** | 2024-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised foundation models have shown great potential in computer vision thanks to the pre-training paradigm of masked autoencoding. Scale is a primary factor influencing the performance of these foundation models. However, these large foundation models often result in high computational cost. This paper focuses on pre-training relatively small vision transformer models that could be efficiently adapted to downstream tasks. Specifically, taking inspiration from knowledge distillation in model compression, we propose a new asymmetric masked distillation (AMD) framework for pre-training relatively small models with autoencoding. The core of AMD is to devise an asymmetric masking strategy, where the teacher model is enabled to see more context information with a lower masking ratio, while the student model is still equipped with a high masking ratio. We design customized multi-layer feature alignment between the teacher encoder and student encoder to regularize the pre-training of student MAE. To demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of AMD, we apply it to both ImageMAE and VideoMAE for pre-training relatively small ViT models. AMD achieved 84.6% classification accuracy on IN1K using the ViT-B model. And AMD achieves 73.3% classification accuracy using the ViT-B model on the Something-in-Something V2 dataset, a 3.7% improvement over the original ViT-B model from VideoMAE. We also transfer AMD pre-trained models to downstream tasks and obtain consistent performance improvement over the original masked autoencoding.

In addition to characterizing how these models understand and reason with natural language, we also investigate how well they comprehend cultural practices, nuances, and values. Alongside standard accuracy metrics, we investigate the brittleness of foundation models in the dimensions of semantics and multilinguality. Our analyses span both open-sourced and closed models, leading to empirical results across classic NLP tasks, reasoning, and cultural comprehension. Key findings indicate (1) Most models exhibit varied behavior when given paraphrased instructions. (2) Many models still suffer from exposure bias (e.g., positional bias, majority label bias). (3) For questions rooted in factual, scientific, and commonsense knowledge, consistent responses are expected across multilingual queries that are semantically equivalent. Yet, most models surprisingly demonstrate inconsistent performance on these queries. (4) Multilingually-trained models have not attained "balanced multilingual" capabilities. Our endeavors underscore the need for more generalizable semantic representations and enhanced multilingual contextualization. SeaEval can serve as a launchpad for more thorough investigations and evaluations for multilingual and multicultural scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in NAACL 2024. 20 pages.

| **[Image-to-Image Matching via Foundation Models: A New Perspective for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00262v1)** | 2024-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) aims to segment images of arbitrary categories specified by class labels or captions. However, most previous best-performing methods, whether pixel grouping methods or region recognition methods, suffer from false matches between image features and category labels. We attribute this to the natural gap between the textual features and visual features. In this work, we rethink how to mitigate false matches from the perspective of image-to-image matching and propose a novel relation-aware intra-modal matching (RIM) framework for OVS based on visual foundation models. RIM achieves robust region classification by firstly constructing diverse image-modal reference features and then matching them with region features based on relation-aware ranking distribution. The proposed RIM enjoys several merits. First, the intra-modal reference features are better aligned, circumventing potential ambiguities that may arise in cross-modal matching. Second, the ranking-based matching process harnesses the structure information implicit in the inter-class relationships, making it more robust than comparing individually. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that RIM outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins, obtaining a lead of more than 10% in mIoU on PASCAL VOC benchmark.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2024 |

Many existing foundation models benefit from the generalization capability of contrastive self-supervised learning by learning compact and high-quality representations without relying on any label information. Amidst the explosive advancements in foundation models across multiple domains, including natural language processing and computer vision, a thorough survey on heterogeneous contrastive learning for the foundation model is urgently needed. In response, this survey critically evaluates the current landscape of heterogeneous contrastive learning for foundation models, highlighting the open challenges and future trends of contrastive learning. In particular, we first present how the recent advanced contrastive learning-based methods deal with view heterogeneity and how contrastive learning is applied to train and fine-tune the multi-view foundation models. Then, we move to contrastive learning methods for task heterogeneity, including pretraining tasks and downstream tasks, and show how different tasks are combined with contrastive learning loss for different purposes. Finally, we conclude this survey by discussing the open challenges and shedding light on the future directions of contrastive learning.</p></details> |  |

Existing DGSS methods typically effectuate robust features by means of Domain Randomization (DR). Such an approach is often limited as it can only account for style diversification and not content. In this work, we take an orthogonal approach to DGSS and propose to use an assembly of CoLlaborative FOUndation models for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (CLOUDS). In detail, CLOUDS is a framework that integrates FMs of various kinds: (i) CLIP backbone for its robust feature representation, (ii) generative models to diversify the content, thereby covering various modes of the possible target distribution, and (iii) Segment Anything Model (SAM) for iteratively refining the predictions of the segmentation model. Extensive experiments show that our CLOUDS excels in adapting from synthetic to real DGSS benchmarks and under varying weather conditions, notably outperforming prior methods by 5.6% and 6.7% on averaged miou, respectively.

Of particular interest is the 2B parameter Gemma model, which provides opportunities to construct capable small-scale MMFMs. In line with findings from other papers in this space, we test the effect of ablating three design features: pretraining the connector, utilizing a more powerful image backbone, and increasing the size of the language backbone. The resulting models, which we call LLaVA-Gemma, exhibit moderate performance on an array of evaluations, but fail to improve past the current comparably sized SOTA models. Closer analysis of performance shows mixed effects; skipping pretraining tends to reduce performance, larger vision models sometimes improve performance, and increasing language model size has inconsistent effects.

We propose to fine-tune a VFM to a mixed-precision quantized supernet. The supernet-based neural architecture search (NAS) can be adopted for this purpose, which trains a supernet, and then subnets within arbitrary hardware budgets can be extracted. However, existing methods face difficulties in optimizing the mixed-precision search space and incurring large memory costs during training. To tackle these challenges, first, we study the effective search space design for fine-tuning a VFM by comparing different operators (such as resolution, feature size, width, depth, and bit-widths) in terms of performance and BitOPs reduction. Second, we propose memory-efficient supernet training using a low-rank adapter (LoRA) and a progressive training strategy. The proposed method is evaluated for the recently proposed VFM, Segment Anything Model, fine-tuned on segmentation tasks. The searched model yields about a 95% reduction in BitOPs without incurring performance degradation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lens: A Foundation Model for Network Traffic in Cybersecurity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03646v3)** | 2024-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network traffic refers to the amount of data being sent and received over the internet or any system that connects computers. Analyzing and understanding network traffic is vital for improving network security and management. However, the analysis of network traffic is challenging due to the diverse nature of data packets, which often feature heterogeneous headers and encrypted payloads lacking semantics. To capture the latent semantics of traffic, a few studies have adopted pre-training techniques based on the Transformer encoder or decoder to learn the representations from massive traffic data. However, these methods typically excel in traffic understanding (classification) or traffic generation tasks. To address this issue, we develop Lens, a foundation model for network traffic that leverages the T5 architecture to learn the pre-trained representations from large-scale unlabeled data. Harnessing the strength of the encoder-decoder framework, which captures the global information while preserving the generative ability, our model can better learn the representations from raw data. To further enhance pre-training effectiveness, we design a novel loss that combines three distinct tasks: Masked Span Prediction (MSP), Packet Order Prediction (POP), and Homologous Traffic Prediction (HTP). Evaluation results across various benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed Lens outperforms the baselines in most downstream tasks related to both traffic understanding and generation. Notably, it also requires much less labeled data for fine-tuning compared to current methods.</p></details> |  |

There has been far less work, however, on the zero-shot abilities of ASR foundation models, with these systems typically fine-tuned to specific tasks or constrained to applications that match their training criterion and data annotation. In this work we investigate the ability of Whisper and MMS, ASR foundation models trained primarily for speech recognition, to perform zero-shot audio classification. We use simple template-based text prompts at the decoder and use the resulting decoding probabilities to generate zero-shot predictions. Without training the model on extra data or adding any new parameters, we demonstrate that Whisper shows promising zero-shot classification performance on a range of 8 audio-classification datasets, outperforming the accuracy of existing state-of-the-art zero-shot baselines by an average of 9%. One important step to unlock the emergent ability is debiasing, where a simple unsupervised reweighting method of the class probabilities yields consistent significant performance gains. We further show that performance increases with model size, implying that as ASR foundation models scale up, they may exhibit improved zero-shot performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2024 (main conference)</p></details> |

Such models can be particularly effective in analyzing brain signals, as this field encompasses numerous application scenarios, and it is costly to perform large-scale annotation. In this work, we present the largest foundation model in brain signals, Brant-2. Compared to Brant, a foundation model designed for intracranial neural signals, Brant-2 not only exhibits robustness towards data variations and modeling scales but also can be applied to a broader range of brain neural data. By experimenting on an extensive range of tasks, we demonstrate that Brant-2 is adaptive to various application scenarios in brain signals. Further analyses reveal the scalability of the Brant-2, validate each component's effectiveness, and showcase our model's ability to maintain performance in scenarios with scarce labels.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

In this context, a variety of GNNs have emerged as promising methodologies for encoding the structural information of graphs. By effectively capturing the graph's underlying structure, these GNNs have shown great potential in enhancing performance in graph learning tasks, such as link prediction and node classification. However, despite their successes, a significant challenge persists: these advanced methods often face difficulties in generalizing to unseen graph data that significantly differs from the training instances. In this work, our aim is to advance the graph learning paradigm by developing a general graph foundation model. This model is designed to understand the complex topological patterns present in diverse graph data, enabling it to excel in zero-shot graph learning tasks across different downstream datasets. To achieve this goal, we address several key technical challenges in our OpenGraph model. Firstly, we propose a unified graph tokenizer to adapt our graph model to generalize well on unseen graph data, even when the underlying graph properties differ significantly from those encountered during training. Secondly, we develop a scalable graph transformer as the foundational encoder, which effectively captures node-wise dependencies within the global topological context. Thirdly, we introduce a data augmentation mechanism enhanced by a LLM to alleviate the limitations of data scarcity in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework. By adapting our OpenGraph to new graph characteristics and comprehending the nuances of diverse graphs, our approach achieves remarkable zero-shot graph learning performance across various settings and domains.</p></details> |  |

| **[Dual-Personalizing Adapter for Federated Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19211v1)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, foundation models, particularly large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated an impressive ability to adapt to various tasks by fine-tuning large amounts of instruction data. Notably, federated foundation models emerge as a privacy preservation method to fine-tune models collaboratively under federated learning (FL) settings by leveraging many distributed datasets with non-IID data. To alleviate communication and computation overhead, parameter-efficient methods are introduced for efficiency, and some research adapted personalization methods to federated foundation models for better user preferences alignment. However, a critical gap in existing research is the neglect of test-time distribution shifts in real-world applications. Therefore, to bridge this gap, we propose a new setting, termed test-time personalization, which not only concentrates on the targeted local task but also extends to other tasks that exhibit test-time distribution shifts. To address challenges in this new setting, we explore a simple yet effective solution to learn a comprehensive foundation model. Specifically, a dual-personalizing adapter architecture (FedDPA) is proposed, comprising a global adapter and a local adapter for addressing test-time distribution shifts and personalization, respectively. Additionally, we introduce an instance-wise dynamic weighting mechanism to optimize the balance between the global and local adapters, enhancing overall performance. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been evaluated on benchmark datasets across different NLP tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[FluoroSAM: A Language-aligned Foundation Model for X-ray Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08059v2)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated X-ray image segmentation would accelerate research and development in diagnostic and interventional precision medicine. Prior efforts have contributed task-specific models capable of solving specific image analysis problems, but the utility of these models is restricted to their particular task domain, and expanding to broader use requires additional data, labels, and retraining efforts. Recently, foundation models (FMs) -- machine learning models trained on large amounts of highly variable data thus enabling broad applicability -- have emerged as promising tools for automated image analysis. Existing FMs for medical image analysis focus on scenarios and modalities where objects are clearly defined by visually apparent boundaries, such as surgical tool segmentation in endoscopy. X-ray imaging, by contrast, does not generally offer such clearly delineated boundaries or structure priors. During X-ray image formation, complex 3D structures are projected in transmission onto the imaging plane, resulting in overlapping features of varying opacity and shape. To pave the way toward an FM for comprehensive and automated analysis of arbitrary medical X-ray images, we develop FluoroSAM, a language-aligned variant of the Segment-Anything Model, trained from scratch on 1.6M synthetic X-ray images. FluoroSAM is trained on data including masks for 128 organ types and 464 non-anatomical objects, such as tools and implants. In real X-ray images of cadaveric specimens, FluoroSAM is able to segment bony anatomical structures based on text-only prompting with 0.51 and 0.79 DICE with point-based refinement, outperforming competing SAM variants for all structures. FluoroSAM is also capable of zero-shot generalization to segmenting classes beyond the training set thanks to its language alignment, which we demonstrate for full lung segmentation on real chest X-rays.</p></details> |  |

Unlike distributed learning frameworks such as federated learning, which often struggle with multimodal data, FMs can transform diverse inputs into embeddings. This process facilitates the integration of information from various modalities and the application of prior learning to new domains. However, deploying FMs in resource-constrained edge systems poses significant challenges. To this end, we introduce CoRAST, a novel learning framework that utilizes FMs for enhanced analysis of distributed, correlated heterogeneous data. Utilizing a server-based FM, CoRAST can exploit existing environment information to extract temporal, spatial, and cross-modal correlations among sensor data. This enables CoRAST to offer context-aware insights for localized client tasks through FM-powered global representation learning. Our evaluation on real-world weather dataset demonstrates CoRAST's ability to exploit correlated heterogeneous data through environmental representation learning to reduce the forecast errors by up to 50.3% compared to the baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted and to be published in 2024 IEEE International Workshop on Foundation Models for Cyber-Physical Systems & Internet of Things (FMSys)</p></details> |

Understanding and mitigating negative effects requires parsing data on forests at global scale from a broad array of sensory modalities, and recently many such problems have been approached using machine learning algorithms for remote sensing. To date, forest-monitoring problems have largely been addressed in isolation. Inspired by the rise of foundation models for computer vision and remote sensing, we here present the first unified Forest Monitoring Benchmark (FoMo-Bench). FoMo-Bench consists of 15 diverse datasets encompassing satellite, aerial, and inventory data, covering a variety of geographical regions, and including multispectral, red-green-blue, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and LiDAR data with various temporal, spatial and spectral resolutions. FoMo-Bench includes multiple types of forest-monitoring tasks, spanning classification, segmentation, and object detection. To further enhance the diversity of tasks and geographies represented in FoMo-Bench, we introduce a novel global dataset, TalloS, combining satellite imagery with ground-based annotations for tree species classification, encompassing 1,000+ categories across multiple hierarchical taxonomic levels (species, genus, family). Finally, we propose FoMo-Net, a baseline foundation model with the capacity to process any combination of commonly used spectral bands in remote sensing, across diverse ground sampling distances and geographical locations worldwide. This work aims to inspire research collaborations between machine learning and forest biology researchers in exploring scalable multi-modal and multi-task models for forest monitoring. All code and data will be made publicly available.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[Foundation Model Makes Clustering A Better Initialization For Cold-Start Active Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02561v2)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Active learning selects the most informative samples from the unlabelled dataset to annotate in the context of a limited annotation budget. While numerous methods have been proposed for subsequent sample selection based on an initialized model, scant attention has been paid to the indispensable phase of active learning: selecting samples for model cold-start initialization. Most of the previous studies resort to random sampling or naive clustering. However, random sampling is prone to fluctuation, and naive clustering suffers from convergence speed, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional data such as imaging data. In this work, we propose to integrate foundation models with clustering methods to select samples for cold-start active learning initialization. Foundation models refer to those trained on massive datasets by the self-supervised paradigm and capable of generating informative and compacted embeddings for various downstream tasks. Leveraging these embeddings to replace raw features such as pixel values, clustering quickly converges and identifies better initial samples. For a comprehensive comparison, we included a classic ImageNet-supervised model to acquire embeddings. Experiments on two clinical tasks of image classification and segmentation demonstrated that foundation model-based clustering efficiently pinpointed informative initial samples, leading to models showcasing enhanced performance than the baseline methods. We envisage that this study provides an effective paradigm for future cold-start active learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Logit Adjustment: Calibrating Fine-tuned Models by Removing Label Bias in Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08106v3)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models like CLIP allow zero-shot transfer on various tasks without additional training data. Yet, the zero-shot performance is less competitive than a fully supervised one. Thus, to enhance the performance, fine-tuning and ensembling are also commonly adopted to better fit the downstream tasks. However, we argue that such prior work has overlooked the inherent biases in foundation models. Due to the highly imbalanced Web-scale training set, these foundation models are inevitably skewed toward frequent semantics, and thus the subsequent fine-tuning or ensembling is still biased. In this study, we systematically examine the biases in foundation models and demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed Generalized Logit Adjustment (GLA) method. Note that bias estimation in foundation models is challenging, as most pre-train data cannot be explicitly accessed like in traditional long-tailed classification tasks. To this end, GLA has an optimization-based bias estimation approach for debiasing foundation models. As our work resolves a fundamental flaw in the pre-training, the proposed GLA demonstrates significant improvements across a diverse range of tasks: it achieves 1.5 pp accuracy gains on ImageNet, an large average improvement (1.4-4.6 pp) on 11 few-shot datasets, 2.4 pp gains on long-tailed classification.

Nevertheless these methods are computationally expensive to train, introduce additional complexity and may require domain knowledge to adapt hyper-parameters to a new dataset. Inspired by developments in object detection, segmentation and large-scale self-supervised foundation vision models, we introduce Component Features (ComFe), a novel explainable-by-design image classification approach using a transformer-decoder head and hierarchical mixture-modelling. With only global image labels and no segmentation or part annotations, ComFe can identify consistent image components, such as the head, body, wings and tail of a bird, and the image background, and determine which of these features are informative in making a prediction. We demonstrate that ComFe obtains higher accuracy compared to previous interpretable models across a range of fine-grained vision benchmarks, without the need to individually tune hyper-parameters for each dataset. We also show that ComFe outperforms a non-interpretable linear head across a range of datasets, including ImageNet, and improves performance on generalisation and robustness benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

The narrative and unstructured nature of clinical notes is a major obstacle for healthcare intelligentization. We address a critical problem of structuring clinical notes into clinical data, according to international interoperability standards. We collect and annotate data for three subtasks, namely, international patient summary, clinical impression and medical encounter. We then supervised fine-tuned a state-of-the-art LLM using public and credentialed clinical data. The training is orchestrated in a way that the target model can first support basic clinical tasks such as abbreviation expansion and temporal information extraction, and then learn to perform more complex downstream clinical tasks. Moreover, we address several modeling challenges in the healthcare context, e.g., extra long context window. Our blind pairwise evaluation shows that SoftTiger outperforms other popular open-source models and GPT-3.5, comparable to Gemini-pro, with a mild gap from GPT-4. We believe that LLMs may become a step-stone towards healthcare digitalization and democratization. Therefore, we publicly release SoftTiger models at scales of 13 billion and 70 billion parameters, as well as datasets and code for our innovative scalable evaluation, hopefully, making a significant contribution to the healthcare industry.</p></details> |  |
| **[Batched Low-Rank Adaptation of Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05677v2)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has recently gained attention for fine-tuning foundation models by incorporating trainable low-rank matrices, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters. While LoRA offers numerous advantages, its applicability for real-time serving to a diverse and global user base is constrained by its incapability to handle multiple task-specific adapters efficiently. This imposes a performance bottleneck in scenarios requiring personalized, task-specific adaptations for each incoming request. To mitigate this constraint, we introduce Fast LoRA (FLoRA), a framework in which each input example in a minibatch can be associated with its unique low-rank adaptation weights, allowing for efficient batching of heterogeneous requests. We empirically demonstrate that FLoRA retains the performance merits of LoRA, showcasing competitive results on the MultiPL-E code generation benchmark spanning over 8 languages and a multilingual speech recognition task across 6 languages.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |

However, the scarcity of such data presents a significant hurdle to extending these methods to general use cases. To address this concern, we present an automated framework to decompose trajectory data into temporally bounded and natural language-based descriptive sub-tasks by leveraging recent prompting strategies for Foundation Models (FMs) including both Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our framework provides both time-based and language-based descriptions for lower-level sub-tasks that comprise full trajectories. To rigorously evaluate the quality of our automatic labeling framework, we contribute an algorithm SIMILARITY to produce two novel metrics, temporal similarity and semantic similarity. The metrics measure the temporal alignment and semantic fidelity of language descriptions between two sub-task decompositions, namely an FM sub-task decomposition prediction and a ground-truth sub-task decomposition. We present scores for temporal similarity and semantic similarity above 90%, compared to 30% of a randomized baseline, for multiple robotic environments, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Our results enable building diverse, large-scale, language-supervised datasets for improved robotic TAMP.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures.

Automatic chart understanding has witnessed significant advancements with the rise of large foundation models in recent years. Foundation models, such as large language models, have revolutionized various natural language processing tasks and are increasingly being applied to chart understanding tasks. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of the recent developments, challenges, and future directions in chart understanding within the context of these foundation models. We review fundamental building blocks crucial for studying chart understanding tasks. Additionally, we explore various tasks and their evaluation metrics and sources of both charts and textual inputs. Various modeling strategies are then examined, encompassing both classification-based and generation-based approaches, along with tool augmentation techniques that enhance chart understanding performance. Furthermore, we discuss the state-of-the-art performance of each task and discuss how we can improve the performance. Challenges and future directions are addressed, highlighting the importance of several topics, such as domain-specific charts, lack of efforts in developing evaluation metrics, and agent-oriented settings. This survey paper serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners in the fields of natural language processing, computer vision, and data analysis, providing valuable insights and directions for future research in chart understanding leveraging large foundation models.

| **[State Space Models as Foundation Models: A Control Theoretic Overview](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16899v1)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been a growing interest in integrating linear state-space models (SSM) in deep neural network architectures of foundation models. This is exemplified by the recent success of Mamba, showing better performance than the state-of-the-art Transformer architectures in language tasks. Foundation models, like e.g. GPT-4, aim to encode sequential data into a latent space in order to learn a compressed representation of the data. The same goal has been pursued by control theorists using SSMs to efficiently model dynamical systems. Therefore, SSMs can be naturally connected to deep sequence modeling, offering the opportunity to create synergies between the corresponding research areas. This paper is intended as a gentle introduction to SSM-based architectures for control theorists and summarizes the latest research developments. It provides a systematic review of the most successful SSM proposals and highlights their main features from a control theoretic perspective. Additionally, we present a comparative analysis of these models, evaluating their performance on a standardized benchmark designed for assessing a model's efficiency at learning long sequences.</p></details> |  |

The system can obtain new skills via the behavioral cloning approach of visuomotor diffusion policies given teleoperated demonstrations. Foundational models are being used to perform skill selection given the user's prompt in natural language. Before executing a skill the foundational model performs a precondition check given an observation of the workspace. We compare the performance of different foundational models to this end as well as give a detailed experimental evaluation of the skills taught by the user in simulation and the real world. Finally, we showcase the combined system on a challenging food serving scenario in the real world. Videos of all experimental executions, as well as the process of teaching new skills in simulation and the real world, are available on the project's website.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://roboskillframework.github.io</p></details> |

The majority of these systems are developed with modular sub-components for decision-making, planning, and control that may be hand-engineered or learning-based. While these existing approaches have been shown to perform well under the situations they were specifically designed for, they can perform especially poorly in rare, out-of-distribution scenarios that will undoubtedly arise at test-time. The rise of foundation models trained on multiple tasks with impressively large datasets from a variety of fields has led researchers to believe that these models may provide common sense reasoning that existing planners are missing. Researchers posit that this common sense reasoning will bridge the gap between algorithm development and deployment to out-of-distribution tasks, like how humans adapt to unexpected scenarios. Large language models have already penetrated the robotics and autonomous systems domains as researchers are scrambling to showcase their potential use cases in deployment. While this application direction is very promising empirically, foundation models are known to hallucinate and generate decisions that may sound reasonable, but are in fact poor. We argue there is a need to step back and simultaneously design systems that can quantify the certainty of a model's decision, and detect when it may be hallucinating. In this work, we discuss the current use cases of foundation models for decision-making tasks, provide a general definition for hallucinations with examples, discuss existing approaches to hallucination detection and mitigation with a focus on decision problems, and explore areas for further research in this exciting field.</p></details> | 31 pages, 2 tables |

Despite the predominant focus on pretraining pathological foundation models, how to adapt foundation models to downstream tasks is little explored. For downstream adaptation, we propose the existence of two domain gaps, i.e., the Foundation-Task Gap and the Task-Instance Gap. To mitigate these gaps, we introduce PathoTune, a framework designed to efficiently adapt pathological or even visual foundation models to pathology-specific tasks via multi-modal prompt tuning. The proposed framework leverages Task-specific Visual Prompts and Task-specific Textual Prompts to identify task-relevant features, along with Instance-specific Visual Prompts for encoding single pathological image features. Results across multiple datasets at both patch-level and WSI-level demonstrate its superior performance over single-modality prompt tuning approaches. Significantly, PathoTune facilitates the direct adaptation of natural visual foundation models to pathological tasks, drastically outperforming pathological foundation models with simple linear probing. The code will be available upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to MICCAI 2024</p></details> |

Many previous methods attempted to solve this task by relying on supervised or reinforcement learning, where they are trained on limited household datasets with close-set objects. However, two key challenges are unsolved: understanding free-form natural language instructions that demand open-set objects, and generalizing to new environments in a zero-shot manner. Aiming to solve the two challenges, in this paper, we propose OpenFMNav, an Open-set Foundation Model based framework for zero-shot object Navigation. We first unleash the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) to extract proposed objects from natural language instructions that meet the user's demand. We then leverage the generalizability of large vision language models (VLMs) to actively discover and detect candidate objects from the scene, building a Versatile Semantic Score Map (VSSM). Then, by conducting common sense reasoning on VSSM, our method can perform effective language-guided exploration and exploitation of the scene and finally reach the goal. By leveraging the reasoning and generalizing abilities of foundation models, our method can understand free-form human instructions and perform effective open-set zero-shot navigation in diverse environments. Extensive experiments on the HM3D ObjectNav benchmark show that our method surpasses all the strong baselines on all metrics, proving our method's effectiveness. Furthermore, we perform real robot demonstrations to validate our method's open-set-ness and generalizability to real-world environments.</p></details> | NAACL 2024 Findings |

Our approach employs a progressive training paradigm that unifies the different self- or weakly-supervised learning frameworks of masked video token reconstruction, cross-modal contrastive learning, and next token prediction. Different training stages would guide our model to capture different levels of structure and semantic information through different pretext tasks. At the data level, we prioritize the spatiotemporal consistency by semantically segmenting videos and generating video-audio-speech captions. This improves the alignment between video and text. We scale both data and model size for our InternVideo2. Through extensive experiments, we validate our designs and demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance on over 60 video and audio tasks.

Traditional models have been siloed, tailored to specific sensors or data types like optical, radar, and hyperspectral, each with its own unique characteristics. This specialization hinders the potential for a holistic analysis that could benefit from the combined strengths of these diverse data sources. Our novel approach introduces the Dynamic One-For-All (DOFA) model, leveraging the concept of neural plasticity in brain science to integrate various data modalities into a single framework adaptively. This dynamic hypernetwork, adjusting to different wavelengths, enables a single versatile Transformer jointly trained on data from five sensors to excel across 12 distinct Earth observation tasks, including sensors never seen during pretraining. DOFA's innovative design offers a promising leap towards more accurate, efficient, and unified Earth observation analysis, showcasing remarkable adaptability and performance in harnessing the potential of multimodal Earth observation data.</p></details> | 33 pages, 10 figures |

Nevertheless, these works primarily focus on a single modality without temporal and geo-context modeling, hampering their capabilities for diverse tasks. In this study, we present SkySense, a generic billion-scale model, pre-trained on a curated multi-modal Remote Sensing Imagery (RSI) dataset with 21.5 million temporal sequences. SkySense incorporates a factorized multi-modal spatiotemporal encoder taking temporal sequences of optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data as input. This encoder is pre-trained by our proposed Multi-Granularity Contrastive Learning to learn representations across different modal and spatial granularities. To further enhance the RSI representations by the geo-context clue, we introduce Geo-Context Prototype Learning to learn region-aware prototypes upon RSI's multi-modal spatiotemporal features. To our best knowledge, SkySense is the largest Multi-Modal RSFM to date, whose modules can be flexibly combined or used individually to accommodate various tasks. It demonstrates remarkable generalization capabilities on a thorough evaluation encompassing 16 datasets over 7 tasks, from single- to multi-modal, static to temporal, and classification to localization. SkySense surpasses 18 recent RSFMs in all test scenarios. Specifically, it outperforms the latest models such as GFM, SatLas and Scale-MAE by a large margin, i.e., 2.76%, 3.67% and 3.61% on average respectively. We will release the pre-trained weights to facilitate future research and Earth Observation applications.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2024 |

In this paper we introduce TensorBank, a petabyte scale tensor lakehouse capable of streaming tensors from Cloud Object Store (COS) to GPU memory at wire speed based on complex relational queries. We use Hierarchical Statistical Indices (HSI) for query acceleration. Our architecture allows to directly address tensors on block level using HTTP range reads. Once in GPU memory, data can be transformed using PyTorch transforms. We provide a generic PyTorch dataset type with a corresponding dataset factory translating relational queries and requested transformations as an instance. By making use of the HSI, irrelevant blocks can be skipped without reading them as those indices contain statistics on their content at different hierarchical resolution levels. This is an opinionated architecture powered by open standards and making heavy use of open-source technology. Although, hardened for production use using geospatial-temporal data, this architecture generalizes to other use case like computer vision, computational neuroscience, biological sequence analysis and more.</p></details> |  |

Addressing the need for efficient spatial understanding in robotics, EPG provides a compact yet powerful approach by attaching foundation model features to the nodes of a pose graph. Unlike traditional methods that rely on bulky data formats like voxel grids or point clouds, EPG is lightweight and scalable. It facilitates a range of robotic tasks, including open-vocabulary querying, disambiguation, image-based querying, language-directed navigation, and re-localization in 3D environments. We showcase the effectiveness of EPG in handling these tasks, demonstrating its capacity to improve how robots interact with and navigate through complex spaces. Through both qualitative and quantitative assessments, we illustrate EPG's strong performance and its ability to outperform existing methods in re-localization. Our work introduces a crucial step forward in enabling robots to efficiently understand and operate within large-scale 3D spaces.</p></details> |  |

Pretraining is an active research topic, encompassing supervised and self-supervised learning methods to initialize model weights effectively. However, transferring the pretrained models to downstream tasks may encounter task discrepancy due to their formulation of pretraining as image classification or object discrimination tasks. In this study, we explore the Multi-Task Pretraining (MTP) paradigm for RS foundation models to address this issue. Using a shared encoder and task-specific decoder architecture, we conduct multi-task supervised pretraining on the SAMRS dataset, encompassing semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and rotated object detection. MTP supports both convolutional neural networks and vision transformer foundation models with over 300 million parameters. The pretrained models are finetuned on various RS downstream tasks, such as scene classification, horizontal and rotated object detection, semantic segmentation, and change detection.

However, this advantage introduces a significant trade-off between diversity and correctness. In software engineering tasks, diversity is key to exploring design spaces and fostering creativity, but the practical value of these solutions is heavily dependent on their correctness. Our study systematically investigates this trade-off using experiments with HumanEval tasks, exploring various parameter settings and prompting strategies. We assess the diversity of code solutions using similarity metrics from the code clone community. The study identifies combinations of parameters and strategies that strike an optimal balance between diversity and correctness, situated on the Pareto front of this trade-off space. These findings offer valuable insights for software engineers on how to effectively use AI foundation models to generate code solutions that are diverse and accurate.</p></details> | 4 pages,Forge 2024 |

However, optimizing FMs often requires access to sensitive data, raising privacy concerns and limiting their applicability in many domains. In this paper, we propose the Federated Foundation Models (FFMs) paradigm, which combines the benefits of FMs and Federated Learning (FL) to enable privacy-preserving and collaborative learning across multiple end-users. We discuss the potential benefits and challenges of integrating FL into the lifespan of FMs, covering pre-training, fine-tuning, and application. We further outline potential future research avenues in FFM, including FFM pre-training, FFM fine-tuning, and federated prompt tuning, which allow the development of more personalized and context-aware models while ensuring data privacy. Moreover, we explore the possibility of continual/lifelong learning in FFMs, as increased computational power at the edge may unlock the potential for optimizing FMs using newly generated private data close to the data source. The proposed FFM concepts offer a flexible and scalable framework for training large language models in a privacy-preserving manner, setting the stage for subsequent advancements in both FM training and federated learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2024 Joint International Conference on Computational Linguistics, Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC-COLING 2024)</p></details> |
| **[As Firm As Their Foundations: Can open-sourced foundation models be used to create adversarial examples for downstream tasks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12693v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pre-trained on web-scale vision-language data, such as CLIP, are widely used as cornerstones of powerful machine learning systems. While pre-training offers clear advantages for downstream learning, it also endows downstream models with shared adversarial vulnerabilities that can be easily identified through the open-sourced foundation model. In this work, we expose such vulnerabilities in CLIP's downstream models and show that foundation models can serve as a basis for attacking their downstream systems. In particular, we propose a simple yet effective adversarial attack strategy termed Patch Representation Misalignment (PRM). Solely based on open-sourced CLIP vision encoders, this method produces adversaries that simultaneously fool more than 20 downstream models spanning 4 common vision-language tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image captioning and visual question-answering). Our findings highlight the concerning safety risks introduced by the extensive usage of public foundational models in the development of downstream systems, calling for extra caution in these scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundations of Causal Discovery on Groups of Variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07047v3)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering causal relationships from observational data is a challenging task that relies on assumptions connecting statistical quantities to graphical or algebraic causal models. In this work, we focus on widely employed assumptions for causal discovery when objects of interest are (multivariate) groups of random variables rather than individual (univariate) random variables, as is the case in a variety of problems in scientific domains such as climate science or neuroscience. If the group-level causal models are derived from partitioning a micro-level model into groups, we explore the relationship between micro and group-level causal discovery assumptions. We investigate the conditions under which assumptions like Causal Faithfulness hold or fail to hold. Our analysis encompasses graphical causal models that contain cycles and bidirected edges. We also discuss grouped time series causal graphs and variants thereof as special cases of our general theoretical framework. Thereby, we aim to provide researchers with a solid theoretical foundation for the development and application of causal discovery methods for variable groups.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised version, minor restructuring.

| **[NetBench: A Large-Scale and Comprehensive Network Traffic Benchmark Dataset for Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10319v2)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In computer networking, network traffic refers to the amount of data transmitted in the form of packets between internetworked computers or Cyber-Physical Systems. Monitoring and analyzing network traffic is crucial for ensuring the performance, security, and reliability of a network. However, a significant challenge in network traffic analysis is to process diverse data packets including both ciphertext and plaintext. While many methods have been adopted to analyze network traffic, they often rely on different datasets for performance evaluation. This inconsistency results in substantial manual data processing efforts and unfair comparisons. Moreover, some data processing methods may cause data leakage due to improper separation of training and testing data. To address these issues, we introduce the NetBench, a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark dataset for assessing machine learning models, especially foundation models, in both network traffic classification and generation tasks. NetBench is built upon seven publicly available datasets and encompasses a broad spectrum of 20 tasks, including 15 classification tasks and 5 generation tasks. Furthermore, we evaluate eight State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) classification models (including two foundation models) and two generative models using our benchmark. The results show that foundation models significantly outperform the traditional deep learning methods in traffic classification. We believe NetBench will facilitate fair comparisons among various approaches and advance the development of foundation models for network traffic. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/WM-JayLab/NetBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[DNABERT-2: Efficient Foundation Model and Benchmark For Multi-Species Genome](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15006v2)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoding the linguistic intricacies of the genome is a crucial problem in biology, and pre-trained foundational models such as DNABERT and Nucleotide Transformer have made significant strides in this area. Existing works have largely hinged on k-mer, fixed-length permutations of A, T, C, and G, as the token of the genome language due to its simplicity. However, we argue that the computation and sample inefficiencies introduced by k-mer tokenization are primary obstacles in developing large genome foundational models. We provide conceptual and empirical insights into genome tokenization, building on which we propose to replace k-mer tokenization with Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a statistics-based data compression algorithm that constructs tokens by iteratively merging the most frequent co-occurring genome segment in the corpus. We demonstrate that BPE not only overcomes the limitations of k-mer tokenization but also benefits from the computational efficiency of non-overlapping tokenization. Based on these insights, we introduce DNABERT-2, a refined genome foundation model that adapts an efficient tokenizer and employs multiple strategies to overcome input length constraints, reduce time and memory expenditure, and enhance model capability. Furthermore, we identify the absence of a comprehensive and standardized benchmark for genome understanding as another significant impediment to fair comparative analysis. In response, we propose the Genome Understanding Evaluation (GUE), a comprehensive multi-species genome classification dataset that amalgamates $36$ distinct datasets across $9$ tasks, with input lengths ranging from $70$ to $10000$. Through comprehensive experiments on the GUE benchmark, we demonstrate that DNABERT-2 achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art model with $21 \times$ fewer parameters and approximately $92 \times$ less GPU time in pre-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2024</p></details> |
| **[Transferring Foundation Models for Generalizable Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05716v4)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving the generalization capabilities of general-purpose robotic manipulation agents in the real world has long been a significant challenge. Existing approaches often rely on collecting large-scale robotic data which is costly and time-consuming, such as the RT-1 dataset. However, due to insufficient diversity of data, these approaches typically suffer from limiting their capability in open-domain scenarios with new objects and diverse environments. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that effectively leverages language-reasoning segmentation mask generated by internet-scale foundation models, to condition robot manipulation tasks. By integrating the mask modality, which incorporates semantic, geometric, and temporal correlation priors derived from vision foundation models, into the end-to-end policy model, our approach can effectively and robustly perceive object pose and enable sample-efficient generalization learning, including new object instances, semantic categories, and unseen backgrounds. We first introduce a series of foundation models to ground natural language demands across multiple tasks. Secondly, we develop a two-stream 2D policy model based on imitation learning, which processes raw images and object masks to predict robot actions with a local-global perception manner. Extensive realworld experiments conducted on a Franka Emika robot arm demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed paradigm and policy architecture. Demos can be found in our submitted video, and more comprehensive ones can be found in link1 or link2.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, we propose the first TTT method for 3D semantic segmentation, TTT-KD, which models Knowledge Distillation (KD) from foundation models (e.g. DINOv2) as a self-supervised objective for adaptation to distribution shifts at test-time. Given access to paired image-pointcloud (2D-3D) data, we first optimize a 3D segmentation backbone for the main task of semantic segmentation using the pointclouds and the task of 2D $\to$ 3D KD by using an off-the-shelf 2D pre-trained foundation model. At test-time, our TTT-KD updates the 3D segmentation backbone for each test sample, by using the self-supervised task of knowledge distillation, before performing the final prediction. Extensive evaluations on multiple indoor and outdoor 3D segmentation benchmarks show the utility of TTT-KD, as it improves performance for both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (ODO) test datasets. We achieve a gain of up to 13% mIoU (7% on average) when the train and test distributions are similar and up to 45% (20% on average) when adapting to OOD test samples.</p></details> |  |
