| **[SPHERE: Unveiling Spatial Blind Spots in Vision-Language Models Through Hierarchical Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12693v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current vision-language models may grasp basic spatial cues and simple directions (e.g. left, right, front, back), but struggle with the multi-dimensional spatial reasoning necessary for human-like understanding and real-world applications. To address this gap, we develop SPHERE (Spatial Perception and Hierarchical Evaluation of REasoning), a hierarchical evaluation framework supported by a new human-annotated dataset. SPHERE systematically probes models across increasing levels of complexity, from fundamental skills to multi-skill integration and high-level reasoning that combines spatial, visual, and logical understanding. Benchmark evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals significant deficiencies, especially in reasoning about distance and proximity, understanding both egocentric and allocentric perspectives, and applying spatial logic in physical contexts. These findings expose critical blind spots in existing models and underscore the need for more advanced spatial reasoning techniques, driving the development of vision-language models that align more closely with human spatial cognition. The SPHERE benchmark is available at https://github.com/zwenyu/SPHERE-VLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Reasoning with Denoising Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21075v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Spatial Reasoning Models (SRMs), a framework to perform reasoning over sets of continuous variables via denoising generative models. SRMs infer continuous representations on a set of unobserved variables, given observations on observed variables. Current generative models on spatial domains, such as diffusion and flow matching models, often collapse to hallucination in case of complex distributions. To measure this, we introduce a set of benchmark tasks that test the quality of complex reasoning in generative models and can quantify hallucination. The SRM framework allows to report key findings about importance of sequentialization in generation, the associated order, as well as the sampling strategies during training. It demonstrates, for the first time, that order of generation can successfully be predicted by the denoising network itself. Using these findings, we can increase the accuracy of specific reasoning tasks from <1% to >50%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://geometric-rl.mpi-inf.mpg.de/srm/</p></details> |
| **[The spatially discrete to continuous limit in the nonlocal quantum diffusion equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21062v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose and analyse a spatial discretization of the non-local Quantum Drift Diffusion (nlQDD) model by Degond, M\`{e}hats and Ringhofer in one space dimension. With our approach, that uses consistently matrices on ${\mathbb C}^N$ instead of operators on $L^2$, we circumvent a variety of analytical subtleties in the analysis of the original nlQDD equation, e.g. related to positivity of densities or to the quantum exponential function. Our starting point is spatially discretized quantum Boltzmann equation with a BGK-type collision kernel, from which we derive the discretized nlQDD model in the diffusive limit. Then we verify that solutions dissipate the von-Neumann entropy, which is a known key property of the original nlQDD, and prove global existence of positive solutions, which seems to be a particular feature of the discretization. Our main result concerns convergence of the scheme: discrete solutions converge -- locally uniformly with respect to space and time -- to classical solutions of the the original nlQDD model on any time interval $[0,T)$ on which the latter remain positive. In particular, this extends the existence theory for nlQDD, that has been established only for initial data close to equilibrium so far.</p></details> | 42 pages, no figures |
| **[Sixth-Sense: Self-Supervised Learning of Spatial Awareness of Humans from a Planar Lidar](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21029v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Localizing humans is a key prerequisite for any service robot operating in proximity to people. In these scenarios, robots rely on a multitude of state-of-the-art detectors usually designed to operate with RGB-D cameras or expensive 3D LiDARs. However, most commercially available service robots are equipped with cameras with a narrow field of view, making them blind when a user is approaching from other directions, or inexpensive 1D LiDARs whose readings are difficult to interpret. To address these limitations, we propose a self-supervised approach to detect humans and estimate their 2D pose from 1D LiDAR data, using detections from an RGB-D camera as a supervision source. Our approach aims to provide service robots with spatial awareness of nearby humans. After training on 70 minutes of data autonomously collected in two environments, our model is capable of detecting humans omnidirectionally from 1D LiDAR data in a novel environment, with 71% precision and 80% recall, while retaining an average absolute error of 13 cm in distance and 44{\deg} in orientation.</p></details> |  |
| **[MagNet: Multi-Level Attention Graph Network for Predicting High-Resolution Spatial Transcriptomics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21011v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of spatial transcriptomics (ST) offers new opportunities to explore the gene expression patterns within the spatial microenvironment. Current research integrates pathological images to infer gene expression, addressing the high costs and time-consuming processes to generate spatial transcriptomics data. However, as spatial transcriptomics resolution continues to improve, existing methods remain primarily focused on gene expression prediction at low-resolution spot levels. These methods face significant challenges, especially the information bottleneck, when they are applied to high-resolution HD data. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces MagNet, a multi-level attention graph network designed for accurate prediction of high-resolution HD data. MagNet employs cross-attention layers to integrate features from multi-resolution image patches hierarchically and utilizes a GAT-Transformer module to aggregate neighborhood information. By integrating multilevel features, MagNet overcomes the limitations posed by low-resolution inputs in predicting high-resolution gene expression. We systematically evaluated MagNet and existing ST prediction models on both a private spatial transcriptomics dataset and a public dataset at three different resolution levels. The results demonstrate that MagNet achieves state-of-the-art performance at both spot level and high-resolution bin levels, providing a novel methodology and benchmark for future research and applications in high-resolution HD-level spatial transcriptomics. Code is available at https://github.com/Junchao-Zhu/MagNet.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two-Stream Spatial-Temporal Transformer Framework for Person Identification via Natural Conversational Keypoints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20803v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the age of AI-driven generative technologies, traditional biometric recognition systems face unprecedented challenges, particularly from sophisticated deepfake and face reenactment techniques. In this study, we propose a Two-Stream Spatial-Temporal Transformer Framework for person identification using upper body keypoints visible during online conversations, which we term conversational keypoints. Our framework processes both spatial relationships between keypoints and their temporal evolution through two specialized branches: a Spatial Transformer (STR) that learns distinctive structural patterns in keypoint configurations, and a Temporal Transformer (TTR) that captures sequential motion patterns. Using the state-of-the-art Sapiens pose estimator, we extract 133 keypoints (based on COCO-WholeBody format) representing facial features, head pose, and hand positions. The framework was evaluated on a dataset of 114 individuals engaged in natural conversations, achieving recognition accuracies of 80.12% for the spatial stream, 63.61% for the temporal stream. We then explored two fusion strategies: a shared loss function approach achieving 82.22% accuracy, and a feature-level fusion method that concatenates feature maps from both streams, significantly improving performance to 94.86%. By jointly modeling both static anatomical relationships and dynamic movement patterns, our approach learns comprehensive identity signatures that are more robust to spoofing than traditional appearance-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modelling the Spatially Varying Non-Linear Effects of Heat Exposure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20745v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exposure to high ambient temperatures is a significant driver of preventable mortality, with non-linear health effects and elevated risks in specific regions. To capture this complexity and account for spatial dependencies across small areas, we propose a Bayesian framework that integrates non-linear functions with the Besag, York, and Mollie (BYM2) model. Applying this framework to all-cause mortality data in Switzerland, we quantified spatial inequalities in heat-related mortality. We retrieved daily all-cause mortality at small areas (2,145 municipalities) for people older than 65 years from the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health and daily mean temperature at 1km$\times$1km grid from the Swiss Federal Office of Meteorology. By fully propagating uncertainties, we derived key epidemiological metrics, including heat-related excess mortality and minimum mortality temperature (MMT). Heat-related excess mortality rates were higher in northern Switzerland, while lower MMTs were observed in mountainous regions. Further, we explored the role of the proportion of individuals older than 85 years, green space, average temperature, deprivation, urbanicity, and language regions in explaining these discrepancies. We found that spatial disparities in heat-related excess mortality were primarily driven by population age distribution, green space, and vulnerabilities associated with elevated temperature exposure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Series ridge regression for spatial data on $\mathbb{R}^d$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02773v7)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper develops a general asymptotic theory of series estimators for spatial data collected at irregularly spaced locations within a sampling region $R_n \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. We employ a stochastic sampling design that can flexibly generate irregularly spaced sampling sites, encompassing both pure increasing and mixed increasing domain frameworks. Specifically, we focus on a spatial trend regression model and a nonparametric regression model with spatially dependent covariates. For these models, we investigate $L^2$-penalized series estimation of the trend and regression functions. We establish uniform and $L^2$ convergence rates and multivariate central limit theorems for general series estimators as main results. Additionally, we show that spline and wavelet series estimators achieve optimal uniform and $L^2$ convergence rates and propose methods for constructing confidence intervals for these estimators. Finally, we demonstrate that our dependence structure conditions on the underlying spatial processes cover a broad class of random fields, including L\'evy-driven continuous autoregressive and moving average random fields.</p></details> | 54 pages, 1 figure |
| **[STPro: Spatial and Temporal Progressive Learning for Weakly Supervised Spatio-Temporal Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20678v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work we study Weakly Supervised Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (WSTVG), a challenging task of localizing subjects spatio-temporally in videos using only textual queries and no bounding box supervision. Inspired by recent advances in vision-language foundation models, we investigate their utility for WSTVG, leveraging their zero-shot grounding capabilities. However, we find that a simple adaptation lacks essential spatio-temporal grounding abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce Tubelet Referral Grounding (TRG), which connects textual queries to tubelets to enable spatio-temporal predictions. Despite its promise, TRG struggles with compositional action understanding and dense scene scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose STPro, a novel progressive learning framework with two key modules: (1) Sub-Action Temporal Curriculum Learning (SA-TCL), which incrementally builds compositional action understanding, and (2) Congestion-Guided Spatial Curriculum Learning (CG-SCL), which adapts the model to complex scenes by spatially increasing task difficulty. STPro achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets, with improvements of 1.0% on VidSTG-Declarative and 3.0% on HCSTVG-v1.</p></details> | CVPR'25 Conference |
| **[GravMAD: Grounded Spatial Value Maps Guided Action Diffusion for Generalized 3D Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20154v5)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots' ability to follow language instructions and execute diverse 3D manipulation tasks is vital in robot learning. Traditional imitation learning-based methods perform well on seen tasks but struggle with novel, unseen ones due to variability. Recent approaches leverage large foundation models to assist in understanding novel tasks, thereby mitigating this issue. However, these methods lack a task-specific learning process, which is essential for an accurate understanding of 3D environments, often leading to execution failures. In this paper, we introduce GravMAD, a sub-goal-driven, language-conditioned action diffusion framework that combines the strengths of imitation learning and foundation models. Our approach breaks tasks into sub-goals based on language instructions, allowing auxiliary guidance during both training and inference. During training, we introduce Sub-goal Keypose Discovery to identify key sub-goals from demonstrations. Inference differs from training, as there are no demonstrations available, so we use pre-trained foundation models to bridge the gap and identify sub-goals for the current task. In both phases, GravMaps are generated from sub-goals, providing GravMAD with more flexible 3D spatial guidance compared to fixed 3D positions. Empirical evaluations on RLBench show that GravMAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with a 28.63% improvement on novel tasks and a 13.36% gain on tasks encountered during training. Evaluations on real-world robotic tasks further show that GravMAD can reason about real-world tasks, associate them with relevant visual information, and generalize to novel tasks. These results demonstrate GravMAD's strong multi-task learning and generalization in 3D manipulation. Video demonstrations are available at: https://gravmad.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025. The first two authors contributed equally</p></details> |
| **[Simultaneous spatial-parametric collocation approximation for parametric PDEs with log-normal random inputs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07799v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We proved convergence rates of fully discrete multi-level simultaneous linear collocation approximation of solutions to parametric elliptic PDEs on bounded polygonal domain with log-normal random inputs based on a finite number of their values at points in the spatial-parametric domain. These convergence rates significantly improve the best-known convergence rates of fully discrete collocation approximation and with some logarithm factors coincide with the convergence rates of best $n$-term approximation. These results are obtained as consequences of general results on multi-level linear sampling recovery by extended least squares algorithms in abstract Bochner spaces.</p></details> |  |
| **[Show and Tell: Visually Explainable Deep Neural Nets via Spatially-Aware Concept Bottleneck Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20134v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern deep neural networks have now reached human-level performance across a variety of tasks. However, unlike humans they lack the ability to explain their decisions by showing where and telling what concepts guided them. In this work, we present a unified framework for transforming any vision neural network into a spatially and conceptually interpretable model. We introduce a spatially-aware concept bottleneck layer that projects "black-box" features of pre-trained backbone models into interpretable concept maps, without requiring human labels. By training a classification layer over this bottleneck, we obtain a self-explaining model that articulates which concepts most influenced its prediction, along with heatmaps that ground them in the input image. Accordingly, we name this method "Spatially-Aware and Label-Free Concept Bottleneck Model" (SALF-CBM). Our results show that the proposed SALF-CBM: (1) Outperforms non-spatial CBM methods, as well as the original backbone, on a variety of classification tasks; (2) Produces high-quality spatial explanations, outperforming widely used heatmap-based methods on a zero-shot segmentation task; (3) Facilitates model exploration and debugging, enabling users to query specific image regions and refine the model's decisions by locally editing its concept maps.</p></details> |  |
| **[STUPD: A Synthetic Dataset for Spatial and Temporal Relation Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06680v3)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding relations between objects is crucial for understanding the semantics of a visual scene. It is also an essential step in order to bridge visual and language models. However, current state-of-the-art computer vision models still lack the ability to perform spatial reasoning well. Existing datasets mostly cover a relatively small number of spatial relations, all of which are static relations that do not intrinsically involve motion. In this paper, we propose the Spatial and Temporal Understanding of Prepositions Dataset (STUPD) -- a large-scale video dataset for understanding static and dynamic spatial relationships derived from prepositions of the English language. The dataset contains 150K visual depictions (videos and images), consisting of 30 distinct spatial prepositional senses, in the form of object interaction simulations generated synthetically using Unity3D. In addition to spatial relations, we also propose 50K visual depictions across 10 temporal relations, consisting of videos depicting event/time-point interactions. To our knowledge, no dataset exists that represents temporal relations through visual settings. In this dataset, we also provide 3D information about object interactions such as frame-wise coordinates, and descriptions of the objects used. The goal of this synthetic dataset is to help models perform better in visual relationship detection in real-world settings. We demonstrate an increase in the performance of various models over 2 real-world datasets (ImageNet-VidVRD and Spatial Senses) when pretrained on the STUPD dataset, in comparison to other pretraining datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Oryx MLLM: On-Demand Spatial-Temporal Understanding at Arbitrary Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12961v4)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual data comes in various forms, ranging from small icons of just a few pixels to long videos spanning hours. Existing multi-modal LLMs usually standardize these diverse visual inputs to a fixed resolution for visual encoders and yield similar numbers of tokens for LLMs. This approach is non-optimal for multimodal understanding and inefficient for processing inputs with long and short visual contents. To solve the problem, we propose Oryx, a unified multimodal architecture for the spatial-temporal understanding of images, videos, and multi-view 3D scenes. Oryx offers an on-demand solution to seamlessly and efficiently process visual inputs with arbitrary spatial sizes and temporal lengths through two core innovations: 1) a pre-trained OryxViT model that can encode images at any resolution into LLM-friendly visual representations; 2) a dynamic compressor module that supports 1x to 16x compression on visual tokens by request. These design features enable Oryx to accommodate extremely long visual contexts, such as videos, with lower resolution and high compression while maintaining high recognition precision for tasks like document understanding with native resolution and no compression. Beyond the architectural improvements, enhanced data curation and specialized training on long-context retrieval and spatial-aware data help Oryx achieve strong capabilities in image, video, and 3D multimodal understanding simultaneously. Our work is open-sourced at https://github.com/Oryx-mllm/Oryx.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Spatial-RAG: Spatial Retrieval Augmented Generation for Real-World Spatial Reasoning Questions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18470v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial reasoning remains a challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), which struggle with spatial data retrieval and reasoning. We propose Spatial Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Spatial-RAG), a framework that extends RAG to spatial tasks by integrating sparse spatial retrieval (spatial databases) and dense semantic retrieval (LLM-based similarity). A multi-objective ranking strategy balances spatial constraints and semantic relevance, while an LLM-guided generator ensures coherent responses. Experiments on a real-world tourism dataset show that Spatial-RAG significantly improves spatial question answering, bridging the gap between LLMs and spatial intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Spectral Diffusion Contrastive Representation Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19699v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although efficient extraction of discriminative spatial-spectral features is critical for hyperspectral images classification (HSIC), it is difficult to achieve these features due to factors such as the spatial-spectral heterogeneity and noise effect. This paper presents a Spatial-Spectral Diffusion Contrastive Representation Network (DiffCRN), based on denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) combined with contrastive learning (CL) for HSIC, with the following characteristics. First,to improve spatial-spectral feature representation, instead of adopting the UNets-like structure which is widely used for DDPM, we design a novel staged architecture with spatial self-attention denoising module (SSAD) and spectral group self-attention denoising module (SGSAD) in DiffCRN with improved efficiency for spectral-spatial feature learning. Second, to improve unsupervised feature learning efficiency, we design new DDPM model with logarithmic absolute error (LAE) loss and CL that improve the loss function effectiveness and increase the instance-level and inter-class discriminability. Third, to improve feature selection, we design a learnable approach based on pixel-level spectral angle mapping (SAM) for the selection of time steps in the proposed DDPM model in an adaptive and automatic manner. Last, to improve feature integration and classification, we design an Adaptive weighted addition modul (AWAM) and Cross time step Spectral-Spatial Fusion Module (CTSSFM) to fuse time-step-wise features and perform classification. Experiments conducted on widely used four HSI datasets demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed DiffCRN over the classical backbone models and state-of-the-art GAN, transformer models and other pretrained methods. The source code and pre-trained model will be made available publicly.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAMBA4D: Efficient Long-Sequence Point Cloud Video Understanding with Disentangled Spatial-Temporal State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14338v3)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud videos can faithfully capture real-world spatial geometries and temporal dynamics, which are essential for enabling intelligent agents to understand the dynamically changing world. However, designing an effective 4D backbone remains challenging, mainly due to the irregular and unordered distribution of points and temporal inconsistencies across frames. Also, recent transformer-based 4D backbones commonly suffer from large computational costs due to their quadratic complexity, particularly for long video sequences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel point cloud video understanding backbone purely based on the State Space Models (SSMs). Specifically, we first disentangle space and time in 4D video sequences and then establish the spatio-temporal correlation with our designed Mamba blocks. The Intra-frame Spatial Mamba module is developed to encode locally similar geometric structures within a certain temporal stride. Subsequently, locally correlated tokens are delivered to the Inter-frame Temporal Mamba module, which integrates long-term point features across the entire video with linear complexity. Our proposed Mamba4d achieves competitive performance on the MSR-Action3D action recognition (+10.4% accuracy), HOI4D action segmentation (+0.7 F1 Score), and Synthia4D semantic segmentation (+0.19 mIoU) datasets. Especially, for long video sequences, our method has a significant efficiency improvement with 87.5% GPU memory reduction and 5.36 times speed-up. Codes will be released at https://github.com/IRMVLab/Mamba4D.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025. The first two authors contribute equally</p></details> |
| **[Efficient 4D fMRI ASD Classification using Spatial-Temporal-Omics-based Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19386v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder impacting social and behavioral development. Resting-state fMRI, a non-invasive tool for capturing brain connectivity patterns, aids in early ASD diagnosis and differentiation from typical controls (TC). However, previous methods, which rely on either mean time series or full 4D data, are limited by a lack of spatial information or by high computational costs. This underscores the need for an efficient solution that preserves both spatial and temporal information. In this paper, we propose a novel, simple, and efficient spatial-temporal-omics learning framework designed to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from fMRI for ASD classification. Our approach addresses these limitations by utilizing 3D time-domain derivatives as the spatial-temporal inter-voxel omics, which preserve full spatial resolution while capturing diverse statistical characteristics of the time series at each voxel. Meanwhile, functional connectivity features serve as the spatial-temporal inter-regional omics, capturing correlations across brain regions. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the ABIDE dataset demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms previous methods while maintaining computational efficiency. We believe our research offers valuable insights that will inform and advance future ASD studies, particularly in the realm of spatial-temporal-omics-based learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)</p></details> |
| **[Efficient and Accurate Spatial Mixing of Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials for Materials Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19081v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine-learned interatomic potentials offer near first-principles accuracy but are computationally expensive, limiting their application in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. Inspired by quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics methods, we present ML-MIX, an efficient and flexible LAMMPS package for accelerating simulations by spatially mixing interatomic potentials of different complexities. Through constrained linear fitting, we show it is possible to generate a 'cheap' approximate model which closely matches an 'expensive' reference in relevant regions of configuration space. We demonstrate the capability of ML-MIX through case-studies in Si, Fe, and W-He systems, achieving up to an 11x speedup on 8,000 atom systems without sacrificing accuracy on static and dynamic quantities, including calculation of minimum energy paths and dynamical simulations of defect diffusion. For larger domain sizes, we show that the achievable speedup of ML-MIX simulations is limited only by the relative speed of the cheap potential over the expensive potential. The ease of use and flexible nature of this method will extend the practical reach of MLIPs throughout computational materials science, enabling parsimonious application to large spatial and temporal domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 13 figures.

| **[Latte++: Spatial-Temporal Voxel-based Test-Time Adaptation for Multi-Modal Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06461v4)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal test-time adaptation (MM-TTA) is proposed to adapt models to an unlabeled target domain by leveraging the complementary multi-modal inputs in an online manner. Previous MM-TTA methods for 3D segmentation rely on predictions of cross-modal information in each input frame, while they ignore the fact that predictions of geometric neighborhoods within consecutive frames are highly correlated, leading to unstable predictions across time. To fulfill this gap, we propose ReLiable Spatial-temporal Voxels (Latte), an MM-TTA method that leverages reliable cross-modal spatial-temporal correspondences for multi-modal 3D segmentation. Motivated by the fact that reliable predictions should be consistent with their spatial-temporal correspondences, Latte aggregates consecutive frames in a sliding-window manner and constructs Spatial-Temporal (ST) voxels to capture temporally local prediction consistency for each modality. After filtering out ST voxels with high ST entropy, Latte conducts cross-modal learning for each point and pixel by attending to those with reliable and consistent predictions among both spatial and temporal neighborhoods. Considering the prediction consistency might vary under different sliding windows, we further propose Latte++ which leverages ST voxels generated under various sliding windows to more thoroughly evaluate intra-modal prediction consistency before the cross-modal fusion. Experimental results show that both Latte and Latte++ achieve state-of-the-art performance on five MM-TTA benchmarks compared to previous MM-TTA or TTA methods. Code will be available at https://github.com/AronCao49/Latte-plusplus.</p></details> |  |
| **[Validating uncertainty propagation approaches for two-stage Bayesian spatial models using simulation-based calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18962v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work tackles the problem of uncertainty propagation in two-stage Bayesian models, with a focus on spatial applications. A two-stage modeling framework has the advantage of being more computationally efficient than a fully Bayesian approach when the first-stage model is already complex in itself, and avoids the potential problem of unwanted feedback effects. Two ways of doing two-stage modeling are the crude plug-in method and the posterior sampling method. The former ignores the uncertainty in the first-stage model, while the latter can be computationally expensive. This paper validates the two aforementioned approaches and proposes a new approach to do uncertainty propagation, which we call the $\mathbf{Q}$ uncertainty method, implemented using the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA). We validate the different approaches using the simulation-based calibration method, which tests the self-consistency property of Bayesian models. Results show that the crude plug-in method underestimates the true posterior uncertainty in the second-stage model parameters, while the resampling approach and the proposed method are correct. We illustrate the approaches in a real life data application which aims to link relative humidity and Dengue cases in the Philippines for August 2018.</p></details> |  |
| **[DualSpec: Text-to-spatial-audio Generation via Dual-Spectrogram Guided Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18952v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-audio (TTA), which generates audio signals from textual descriptions, has received huge attention in recent years. However, recent works focused on text to monaural audio only. As we know, spatial audio provides more immersive auditory experience than monaural audio, e.g. in virtual reality. To address this issue, we propose a text-to-spatial-audio (TTSA) generation framework named DualSpec.Specifically, it first trains variational autoencoders (VAEs) for extracting the latent acoustic representations from sound event audio. Then, given text that describes sound events and event directions, the proposed method uses the encoder of a pretrained large language model to transform the text into text features. Finally, it trains a diffusion model from the latent acoustic representations and text features for the spatial audio generation. In the inference stage, only the text description is needed to generate spatial audio. Particularly, to improve the synthesis quality and azimuth accuracy of the spatial sound events simultaneously, we propose to use two kinds of acoustic features. One is the Mel spectrograms which is good for improving the synthesis quality, and the other is the short-time Fourier transform spectrograms which is good at improving the azimuth accuracy. We provide a pipeline of constructing spatial audio dataset with text prompts, for the training of the VAEs and diffusion model. We also introduce new spatial-aware evaluation metrics to quantify the azimuth errors of the generated spatial audio recordings. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can generate spatial audio with high directional and event consistency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sherlock: Towards Multi-scene Video Abnormal Event Extraction and Localization via a Global-local Spatial-sensitive LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18863v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior studies on Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) mainly focus on detecting whether each video frame is abnormal or not in the video, which largely ignore the structured video semantic information (i.e., what, when, and where does the abnormal event happen). With this in mind, we propose a new chat-paradigm \textbf{M}ulti-scene Video Abnormal Event Extraction and Localization (M-VAE) task, aiming to extract the abnormal event quadruples (i.e., subject, event type, object, scene) and localize such event. Further, this paper believes that this new task faces two key challenges, i.e., global-local spatial modeling and global-local spatial balancing. To this end, this paper proposes a Global-local Spatial-sensitive Large Language Model (LLM) named Sherlock, i.e., acting like Sherlock Holmes to track down the criminal events, for this M-VAE task. Specifically, this model designs a Global-local Spatial-enhanced MoE (GSM) module and a Spatial Imbalance Regulator (SIR) to address the two challenges respectively. Extensive experiments on our M-VAE instruction dataset show the significant advantages of Sherlock over several advanced Video-LLMs. This justifies the importance of global-local spatial information for the M-VAE task and the effectiveness of Sherlock in capturing such information.</p></details> |  |
| **[Both Ears Wide Open: Towards Language-Driven Spatial Audio Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10676v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion models have achieved great success in mono-channel audio generation. However, when it comes to stereo audio generation, the soundscapes often have a complex scene of multiple objects and directions. Controlling stereo audio with spatial contexts remains challenging due to high data costs and unstable generative models. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first attempt to address these issues. We first construct a large-scale, simulation-based, and GPT-assisted dataset, BEWO-1M, with abundant soundscapes and descriptions even including moving and multiple sources. Beyond text modality, we have also acquired a set of images and rationally paired stereo audios through retrieval to advance multimodal generation. Existing audio generation models tend to generate rather random and indistinct spatial audio. To provide accurate guidance for Latent Diffusion Models, we introduce the SpatialSonic model utilizing spatial-aware encoders and azimuth state matrices to reveal reasonable spatial guidance. By leveraging spatial guidance, our model not only achieves the objective of generating immersive and controllable spatial audio from text but also extends to other modalities as the pioneer attempt. Finally, under fair settings, we conduct subjective and objective evaluations on simulated and real-world data to compare our approach with prevailing methods. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its capability to generate spatial audio that adheres to physical rules.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Specifically, we define a differentially private Poisson point synthesizer (PPS) and Cox point synthesizer (CPS) to generate synthetic point patterns with the concept of the $\alpha$-neighborhood that relaxes the original definition of DP. We present three example models to construct a differentially private PPS and CPS, providing sufficient conditions on their parameters to ensure the DP given a specified privacy budget. In addition, we demonstrate that the synthesizers can be applied to point patterns on the linear network. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed approaches effectively maintain the privacy and utility of synthetic data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Reconstruction of Spatially-Coherent and Realistic Clothed Humans and Objects from a Single Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18150v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in human shape learning have focused on achieving accurate human reconstruction from single-view images. However, in the real world, humans share space with other objects. Reconstructing images with humans and objects is challenging due to the occlusions and lack of 3D spatial awareness, which leads to depth ambiguity in the reconstruction. Existing methods in monocular human-object reconstruction fail to capture intricate details of clothed human bodies and object surfaces due to their template-based nature. In this paper, we jointly reconstruct clothed humans and objects in a spatially coherent manner from single-view images, while addressing human-object occlusions. A novel attention-based neural implicit model is proposed that leverages image pixel alignment to retrieve high-quality details, and incorporates semantic features extracted from the human-object pose to enable 3D spatial awareness. A generative diffusion model is used to handle human-object occlusions. For training and evaluation, we introduce a synthetic dataset with rendered scenes of inter-occluded 3D human scans and diverse objects. Extensive evaluation on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrates the superior quality of proposed human-object reconstructions over competitive methods.</p></details> |  |

Despite the success of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) in computer vision, its application to HTR has been rather scattered, leaving key SSL methodologies unexplored. This work focuses on one of them, namely Spatial Context-based SSL. We investigate how this family of approaches can be adapted and optimized for HTR and propose new workflows that leverage the unique features of handwritten text. Our experiments demonstrate that the methods considered lead to advancements in the state-of-the-art of SSL for HTR in a number of benchmark cases.</p></details> | Under review |

In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage training framework designed to equip standard LLMs with visual reasoning abilities for maze navigation. First, we leverage Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) on a curated dataset of tokenized maze representations to teach the model to predict step-by-step movement commands. Next, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-a technique used in DeepSeekR1-with a carefully crafted reward function to refine the model's sequential decision-making and encourage emergent chain-of-thought behaviors. Experimental results on synthetically generated mazes show that while a baseline model fails to navigate the maze, the SFT-trained model achieves 86% accuracy, and further GRPO fine-tuning boosts accuracy to 93%. Qualitative analyses reveal that GRPO fosters more robust and self-corrective reasoning, highlighting the potential of our approach to bridge the gap between language models and visual spatial tasks. These findings offer promising implications for applications in robotics, autonomous navigation, and other domains that require integrated visual and sequential reasoning.</p></details> |  |

In this scheme, the adaptive spatial modulation (ASM)-based antennas selection works at the receiver by employing the characteristics of the RIS in each time slot, where the signal-to-noise ratio at specific selected antennas can be further enhanced with near few powers. Besides for the bits from constellation symbols, the extra bits can be mapped into the indices of receive antenna combinations and conveyed to the receiver through the ASM-based antenna-combination selection, thus providing higher spectral efficiency. To explicitly present the RASM scheme, the analytical performance of bit error rate of it is discussed in this paper. As a trade-off selection, the proposed scheme shows higher spectral efficiency and remains the satisfactory error performance. Simulation and analytical results demonstrate the better performance and exhibit more potential to apply in practical wireless communication.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted by IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC) 2025</p></details> |
| **[FoREST: Frame of Reference Evaluation in Spatial Reasoning Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17775v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence. One key concept in spatial cognition is the Frame of Reference (FoR), which identifies the perspective of spatial expressions. Despite its significance, FoR has received limited attention in AI models that need spatial intelligence. There is a lack of dedicated benchmarks and in-depth evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in this area. To address this issue, we introduce the Frame of Reference Evaluation in Spatial Reasoning Tasks (FoREST) benchmark, designed to assess FoR comprehension in LLMs. We evaluate LLMs on answering questions that require FoR comprehension and layout generation in text-to-image models using FoREST. Our results reveal a notable performance gap across different FoR classes in various LLMs, affecting their ability to generate accurate layouts for text-to-image generation. This highlights critical shortcomings in FoR comprehension. To improve FoR understanding, we propose Spatial-Guided prompting, which improves LLMs ability to extract essential spatial concepts. Our proposed method improves overall performance across spatial reasoning tasks.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[AI-driven 3D Spatial Transcriptomics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17761v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A comprehensive three-dimensional (3D) map of tissue architecture and gene expression is crucial for illuminating the complexity and heterogeneity of tissues across diverse biomedical applications. However, most spatial transcriptomics (ST) approaches remain limited to two-dimensional (2D) sections of tissue. Although current 3D ST methods hold promise, they typically require extensive tissue sectioning, are complex, are not compatible with non-destructive 3D tissue imaging technologies, and often lack scalability. Here, we present VOlumetrically Resolved Transcriptomics EXpression (VORTEX), an AI framework that leverages 3D tissue morphology and minimal 2D ST to predict volumetric 3D ST. By pretraining on diverse 3D morphology-transcriptomic pairs from heterogeneous tissue samples and then fine-tuning on minimal 2D ST data from a specific volume of interest, VORTEX learns both generic tissue-related and sample-specific morphological correlates of gene expression. This approach enables dense, high-throughput, and fast 3D ST, scaling seamlessly to large tissue volumes far beyond the reach of existing 3D ST techniques. By offering a cost-effective and minimally destructive route to obtaining volumetric molecular insights, we anticipate that VORTEX will accelerate biomarker discovery and our understanding of morphomolecular associations and cell states in complex tissues. Interactive 3D ST volumes can be viewed at https://vortex-demo.github.io/</p></details> |  |
| **[Traveling Waves Integrate Spatial Information Through Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06034v3)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traveling waves of neural activity are widely observed in the brain, but their precise computational function remains unclear. One prominent hypothesis is that they enable the transfer and integration of spatial information across neural populations. However, few computational models have explored how traveling waves might be harnessed to perform such integrative processing. Drawing inspiration from the famous "Can one hear the shape of a drum?" problem -- which highlights how normal modes of wave dynamics encode geometric information -- we investigate whether similar principles can be leveraged in artificial neural networks. Specifically, we introduce convolutional recurrent neural networks that learn to produce traveling waves in their hidden states in response to visual stimuli, enabling spatial integration. By then treating these wave-like activation sequences as visual representations themselves, we obtain a powerful representational space that outperforms local feed-forward networks on tasks requiring global spatial context. In particular, we observe that traveling waves effectively expand the receptive field of locally connected neurons, supporting long-range encoding and communication of information. We demonstrate that models equipped with this mechanism solve visual semantic segmentation tasks demanding global integration, significantly outperforming local feed-forward models and rivaling non-local U-Net models with fewer parameters. As a first step toward traveling-wave-based communication and visual representation in artificial networks, our findings suggest wave-dynamics may provide efficiency and training stability benefits, while simultaneously offering a new framework for connecting models to biological recordings of neural activity.</p></details> |  |

Existing autoregressive methods, which rely on previous frame-sentence pairs, struggle with high memory usage, slow generation speeds, and limited context integration. To address these issues, we propose ContextualStory, a novel framework designed to generate coherent story frames and extend frames for visual storytelling. ContextualStory utilizes Spatially-Enhanced Temporal Attention to capture spatial and temporal dependencies, handling significant character movements effectively. Additionally, we introduce a Storyline Contextualizer to enrich context in storyline embedding, and a StoryFlow Adapter to measure scene changes between frames for guiding the model. Extensive experiments on PororoSV and FlintstonesSV datasets demonstrate that ContextualStory significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods in both story visualization and continuation.

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable translation performance in gloss-free methods by harnessing their powerful natural language generation capabilities. However, these methods often rely on domain-specific fine-tuning of visual encoders to achieve optimal results. By contrast, this paper emphasizes the importance of capturing the spatial configurations and motion dynamics inherent in sign language. With this in mind, we introduce Spatial and Motion-based Sign Language Translation (SpaMo), a novel LLM-based SLT framework. The core idea of SpaMo is simple yet effective. We first extract spatial and motion features using off-the-shelf visual encoders and then input these features into an LLM with a language prompt. Additionally, we employ a visual-text alignment process as a warm-up before the SLT supervision. Our experiments demonstrate that SpaMo achieves state-of-the-art performance on two popular datasets, PHOENIX14T and How2Sign.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025 main</p></details> |
| **[Weighted model calibration with spatial conditional information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16785v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cost functions such as mean square error are often used in environmental model calibration. These treat observations as independent and equally important even though model residuals exhibit spatial dependence and additional observations near existing points do not provide as much information on the system as those elsewhere. To address this issue, we develop a method to derive calibration weights based on spatial conditional information. Using simulation experiments with Gaussian processes and the Tephra2 volcanic tephra dispersion model, we show that the additional accuracy and precision from weighted inference increases with the degree of observation clustering and spatial dependence present. To demonstrate real-world relevance, the methods are applied to tephra load observations from the 2014 eruption of the Kelud volcano in Indonesia.</p></details> |  |

A Benchmark and Investigation on Spatial-temporal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03249v3)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide spectrum of tasks; however, they still face limitations in scenarios that demand long-term planning and spatial reasoning. To facilitate this line of research, in this work, we propose a new benchmark, termed $\textbf{P}$ath $\textbf{P}$lanning from $\textbf{N}$atural $\textbf{L}$anguage ($\textbf{PPNL}$). Our benchmark evaluates LLMs' spatial-temporal reasoning by formulating ''path planning'' tasks that require an LLM to navigate to target locations while avoiding obstacles and adhering to constraints. Leveraging this benchmark, we systematically investigate LLMs including GPT-4 via different few-shot prompting methodologies as well as BART and T5 of various sizes via fine-tuning. Our experimental results show the promise of few-shot GPT-4 in spatial reasoning, when it is prompted to reason and act interleavedly, although it still fails to perform long-term temporal reasoning. In contrast, while fine-tuned LLMs achieved impressive results on in-distribution reasoning tasks, they struggled to generalize to larger environments or environments with more obstacles.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we introduce SmartSpatial, an innovative approach that not only enhances the spatial arrangement capabilities of Stable Diffusion but also fosters AI-assisted creative workflows through 3D-aware conditioning and attention-guided mechanisms. SmartSpatial incorporates depth information injection and cross-attention control to ensure precise object placement, delivering notable improvements in spatial accuracy metrics. In conjunction with SmartSpatial, we present SmartSpatialEval, a comprehensive evaluation framework that bridges computational spatial accuracy with qualitative artistic assessments. Experimental results show that SmartSpatial significantly outperforms existing methods, setting new benchmarks for spatial fidelity in AI-driven art and creativity.</p></details> | 9 pages |

In this work, we investigate the influence of different text-based spatial representations on LLM performance and internal activations in a grid-world navigation task. By evaluating models of various sizes on a task that requires navigating toward a goal, we examine how the format used to encode spatial information impacts decision-making. Our experiments reveal that cartesian representations of space consistently yield higher success rates and path efficiency, with performance scaling markedly with model size. Moreover, probing LLaMA-3.1-8B revealed subsets of internal units, primarily located in intermediate layers, that robustly correlate with spatial features, such as the position of the agent in the grid or action correctness, regardless of how that information is represented, and are also activated by unrelated spatial reasoning tasks. This work advances our understanding of how LLMs process spatial information and provides valuable insights for developing more interpretable and robust agentic AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Common destinations, typically referred to as hubs or points of interest, are arguably the most effective spots for the type of disease spread via airborne transmission. In this work, we model the locations of individuals (agents) and common destinations (hubs) by random spatial point processes in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and focus on disease propagation through agents visiting common hubs. The probability of an agent visiting a hub depends on their distance through a connection function $f$. The system is represented by a random bipartite geometric (RBG) graph. We study the degrees and percolation of the RBG graph for general connection functions. We show that the critical density of hubs for percolation is dictated by the support of the connection function $f$, which reveals the critical role of long-distance travel (or its restrictions) in disease spreading.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering</p></details> |

The framework combines a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) inferring the two spatially varying TGV parameters with an unrolled algorithmic scheme that solves the corresponding variational problem. The two subnetworks are jointly trained end-to-end in a supervised fashion and as such the CNN learns to compute those parameters that drive the reconstructed images as close to the ground truth as possible. Numerical results in image denoising and MRI reconstruction show a significant qualitative and quantitative improvement compared to the best TGV scalar parameter case as well as to other approaches employing spatially varying parameters computed by unsupervised methods. We also observe that the inferred spatially varying parameter maps have a consistent structure near the image edges, asking for further theoretical investigations. In particular, the parameter that weighs the first-order TGV term has a triple-edge structure with alternating high-low-high values whereas the one that weighs the second-order term attains small values in a large neighbourhood around the edges.</p></details> |  |

In order to simultaneously visualize more objects, in this paper, we propose to use video-to-video translation that mimics the development process of microscopic objects. In essence, we use a microscopy video-to-video translation framework namely Spatial-temporal Generative Adversarial Network (STGAN) to reveal the spatial and temporal relationships between the microscopic objects, after which a microscopy video of one object can be translated to another object in a different domain. The experimental results confirm that the proposed STGAN is effective in microscopy video-to-video translation that mitigates the spectral conflicts caused by the limited fluorescent labels, allowing multiple microscopic objects be simultaneously visualized.</p></details> |  |

The spatial structure of the data significantly impacts valid statistical inference. Existing models for areal data often rely on adjacency matrices, struggling to differentiate between polygons of varying sizes and shapes. Conversely, data fusion models rely on computationally intensive numerical integrals, presenting challenges for moderately large datasets. In response to these issues, we propose the Hausdorff-Gaussian process (HGP), a versatile model utilizing the Hausdorff distance to capture spatial dependence in both point and areal data. Integration into generalized linear mixed-effects models enhances its applicability, particularly in addressing data fusion challenges. We validate our approach through a comprehensive simulation study and application to two real-world scenarios: one involving areal data and another demonstrating its effectiveness in data fusion. The results suggest that the HGP is competitive with specialized models regarding goodness-of-fit and prediction performances. In summary, the HGP offers a flexible and robust solution for modeling spatial data of various types and shapes, with potential applications spanning fields such as public health and climate science.</p></details> |  |

The proposed estimation methodology covers both homoscedastic and heteroscedastic data, ensuring consistency and efficiency in the estimators of the parameters $\pmb{\rho}$ and $\pmb{\beta}$. The model is based on a robust theoretical framework, supported by the analysis of the asymptotic properties of the estimators, which reinforces its practical implementation. To facilitate its use, an algorithm has been developed in the R software, making it a standard tool for the analysis of complex spatial data. The proposed model proves to be more effective than other similar techniques, especially when modeling data with normal spatial structures and non-normal distributions, even when the residuals are not homoscedastic. Finally, the application of the model to homicide rates in the United States highlights its advantages in both statistical and social analysis, positioning it as a key tool for the analysis of spatial data in various disciplines.</p></details> |  |

We describe toric codes as quantum counterparts of classical two-dimensional spatially-coupled (2D-SC) codes, and introduce spatially-coupled quantum LDPC (SC-QLDPC) codes as a generalization. We use the convolutional structure to represent the parity check matrix of a 2D-SC code as a polynomial in two indeterminates, and derive an algebraic condition that is both necessary and sufficient for a 2D-SC code to be a stabilizer code. This algebraic framework facilitates the construction of new code families. While not the focus of this paper, we note that small memory facilitates physical connectivity of qubits, and it enables local encoding and low-latency windowed decoding. In this paper, we use the algebraic framework to optimize short cycles in the Tanner graph of 2D-SC hypergraph product (HGP) codes that arise from short cycles in either component code. While prior work focuses on QLDPC codes with rate less than 1/10, we construct 2D-SC HGP codes with small memories, higher rates (about 1/3), and superior thresholds.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 10 figures.

However, while latent space modeling paradigms have transformed image and video generation, similar approaches are more difficult for most dynamical systems. Such systems -- from chemical molecule structures to collective human behavior -- are described by interactions of entities, making them inherently linked to connectivity patterns and the traceability of entities over time. Our approach, LaM-SLidE (Latent Space Modeling of Spatial Dynamical Systems via Linked Entities), combines the advantages of graph neural networks, i.e., the traceability of entities across time-steps, with the efficiency and scalability of recent advances in image and video generation, where pre-trained encoder and decoder are frozen to enable generative modeling in the latent space. The core idea of LaM-SLidE is to introduce identifier representations (IDs) to allow for retrieval of entity properties, e.g., entity coordinates, from latent system representations and thus enables traceability. Experimentally, across different domains, we show that LaM-SLidE performs favorably in terms of speed, accuracy, and generalizability.

Egocentric spatial images and videos are emerging as a compelling form of stereoscopic XR content. The assessment for the Quality of Experience (QoE) of XR content is important to ensure a high-quality viewing experience. Different from traditional 2D images, egocentric spatial images present challenges for perceptual quality assessment due to their special shooting, processing methods, and stereoscopic characteristics. However, the corresponding image quality assessment (IQA) research for egocentric spatial images is still lacking. In this paper, we establish the Egocentric Spatial Images Quality Assessment Database (ESIQAD), the first IQA database dedicated for egocentric spatial images as far as we know. Our ESIQAD includes 500 egocentric spatial images and the corresponding mean opinion scores (MOSs) under three display modes, including 2D display, 3D-window display, and 3D-immersive display. Based on our ESIQAD, we propose a novel mamba2-based multi-stage feature fusion model, termed ESIQAnet, which predicts the perceptual quality of egocentric spatial images under the three display modes. Specifically, we first extract features from multiple visual state space duality (VSSD) blocks, then apply cross attention to fuse binocular view information and use transposed attention to further refine the features. The multi-stage features are finally concatenated and fed into a quality regression network to predict the quality score. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the ESIQAnet outperforms 22 state-of-the-art IQA models on the ESIQAD under all three display modes. The database and code are available at https://github.com/IntMeGroup/ESIQA.</p></details> | 9 pages, 12 figures |

Traditional approaches like on-device storage or reactive data fetching from the cloud often result in limited AR experiences or unacceptable lag. Edge caching, which caches AR objects closer to the user, provides a promising solution. However, existing edge caching approaches do not consider AR-specific features such as AR object sizes, user interactions, and physical location. This paper investigates how to further optimize edge caching by employing AR-aware prefetching techniques. We present SAAP, a Spatial Awareness and Association-based Prefetching policy specifically designed for MAR Caches. SAAP intelligently prioritizes the caching of virtual objects based on their association with other similar objects and the user's proximity to them. It also considers the recency of associations and uses a lazy fetching strategy to efficiently manage edge resources and maximize Quality of Experience (QoE). Through extensive evaluation using both synthetic and real-world workloads, we demonstrate that SAAP significantly improves cache hit rates compared to standard caching algorithms, achieving gains ranging from 3\% to 40\% while reducing the need for on-demand data retrieval from the cloud. Further, we present an adaptive tuning algorithm that automatically tunes SAAP parameters to achieve optimal performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SAAP to substantially enhance the user experience in MAR applications by ensuring the timely availability of virtual objects.</p></details> |  |

It is desirable to develop flexible regression models that allow for nonlinearities and interactions in the covariate specification. Existing machine learning approaches that allow for spatial dependence in the residuals fail to provide reliable uncertainty estimates. In this paper, we investigate the combination of a Gaussian process spatial model with a Bayesian Additive Regression Tree (BART) model. The computational burden of the approach is reduced by combining Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) technique. We study the performance of the method first via simulation. We then use the model to predict anthropometric responses in Kenya, with the data collected via a complex sampling design. In particular, household survey data are collected via stratified two-stage unequal probability cluster sampling, which requires special care when modeled.</p></details> |  |

A power station or transmission line can be significantly affected due to bushfires, leading to an increase in operational costs. We study a fundamental but challenging problem of planning the optimal power flow (OPF) for power systems subject to bushfires. Considering the stochastic nature of bushfire spread, we develop a model to capture such dynamics based on Moore's neighborhood model. Under a periodic inspection scheme that reveals the in-situ bushfire status, we propose an online optimization modeling framework that sequentially plans the power flows in the electricity network. Our framework assumes that the spread of bushfires is non-stationary over time, and the spread and containment probabilities are unknown. To meet these challenges, we develop a contextual online learning algorithm that treats the in-situ geographical information of the bushfire as a 'spatial context'. The online learning algorithm learns the unknown probabilities sequentially based on the observed data and then makes the OPF decision accordingly. The sequential OPF decisions aim to minimize the regret function, which is defined as the cumulative loss against the clairvoyant strategy that knows the true model parameters. We provide a theoretical guarantee of our algorithm by deriving a bound on the regret function, which outperforms the regret bound achieved by other benchmark algorithms. Our model assumptions are verified by the real bushfire data from NSW, Australia, and we apply our model to two power systems to illustrate its applicability.</p></details> |  |

However, existing deep learning models often face challenges related to scalability and flexibility as datasets grow. To this end, this paper introduces GeoAggregator, an efficient and lightweight algorithm based on transformer architecture designed specifically for geospatial tabular data modeling. GeoAggregators explicitly account for spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity through Gaussian-biased local attention and global positional awareness. Additionally, we introduce a new attention mechanism that uses the Cartesian product to manage the size of the model while maintaining strong expressive power. We benchmark GeoAggregator against spatial statistical models, XGBoost, and several state-of-the-art geospatial deep learning methods using both synthetic and empirical geospatial datasets. The results demonstrate that GeoAggregators achieve the best or second-best performance compared to their competitors on nearly all datasets. GeoAggregator's efficiency is underscored by its reduced model size, making it both scalable and lightweight. Moreover, ablation experiments offer insights into the effectiveness of the Gaussian bias and Cartesian attention mechanism, providing recommendations for further optimizing the GeoAggregator's performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the main technical track of the AAAI 2025</p></details> |

The problem is important since accurate quantification of the carbon cycle in agroecosystems is crucial for mitigating climate change and ensuring sustainable food production. Predicting accurate land emissions is challenging since calibrating the heterogeneous nature of soil properties, moisture, and environmental conditions is hard at decision-relevant scales. Traditional approaches do not adequately estimate land emissions due to location-independent parameters failing to leverage the spatial heterogeneity and also require large datasets. To overcome these limitations, we proposed Spatial Distribution-Shift Aware Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (SDSA-KGML), which leverages location-dependent parameters that account for significant spatial heterogeneity in soil moisture from multiple sites within the same region. Experimental results demonstrate that SDSA-KGML models achieve higher local accuracy for the specified states in the Midwest Region.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatially Varying Coefficient Models for Estimating Heterogeneous Mixture Effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14651v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies of associations between environmental exposures and health outcomes have shifted toward estimating the effect of simultaneous exposure to multiple chemicals. Summary index methods, such as the weighted quantile sum and quantile g-computation, are now commonly used to analyze environmental exposure mixtures in a broad range of applications. These methods provide a simple and interpretable framework for quantifying mixture effects. However, when data arise from a large geographical study region, it may be unreasonable to expect a common mixture effect. In this work, we explore the use of a recently developed spatially varying coefficient model based on Bayesian additive regression trees to estimate spatially heterogeneous mixture effects using quantile g-computation. We conducted simulation studies to evaluate the method's performance. We then applied this model to an analysis of multiple ambient air pollutants and birthweight in Georgia, USA from 2005-2016. We find evidence of county-level spatially varying mixture associations, where for 17 of 159 counties in Georgia, elevated concentrations of a mixture of PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone, and carbon monoxide were associated with a reduction in birthweight by as much as -16.65 grams (95% credible interval: -33.93, -0.40) per decile increase in all five air pollutants.</p></details> | 19 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Reliable Explainability of Deep Learning Spatial-Spectral Classifiers for Improved Semantic Segmentation in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14416v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating hyperspectral imagery (HSI) with deep neural networks (DNNs) can strengthen the accuracy of intelligent vision systems by combining spectral and spatial information, which is useful for tasks like semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. To advance research in such safety-critical systems, determining the precise contribution of spectral information to complex DNNs' output is needed. To address this, several saliency methods, such as class activation maps (CAM), have been proposed primarily for image classification. However, recent studies have raised concerns regarding their reliability. In this paper, we address their limitations and propose an alternative approach by leveraging the data provided by activations and weights from relevant DNN layers to better capture the relationship between input features and predictions. The study aims to assess the superior performance of HSI compared to 3-channel and single-channel DNNs. We also address the influence of spectral signature normalization for enhancing DNN robustness in real-world driving conditions.</p></details> |  |

To advance Spatial Artificial Intelligence, we pioneer a psychometric framework defining five Basic Spatial Abilities (BSAs) in Visual Language Models (VLMs): Spatial Perception, Spatial Relation, Spatial Orientation, Mental Rotation, and Spatial Visualization. Benchmarking 13 mainstream VLMs through nine validated psychometric experiments reveals significant gaps versus humans (average score 24.95 vs. 68.38), with three key findings: 1) VLMs mirror human hierarchies (strongest in 2D orientation, weakest in 3D rotation) with independent BSAs (Pearson's r<0.4); 2) Smaller models such as Qwen2-VL-7B surpass larger counterparts, with Qwen leading (30.82) and InternVL2 lagging (19.6); 3) Interventions like chain-of-thought (0.100 accuracy gain) and 5-shot training (0.259 improvement) show limits from architectural constraints. Identified barriers include weak geometry encoding and missing dynamic simulation. By linking psychometric BSAs to VLM capabilities, we provide a diagnostic toolkit for spatial intelligence evaluation, methodological foundations for embodied AI development, and a cognitive science-informed roadmap for achieving human-like spatial intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient 3D Perception on Multi-Sweep Point Cloud with Gumbel Spatial Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07742v3)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies point cloud perception within outdoor environments. Existing methods face limitations in recognizing objects located at a distance or occluded, due to the sparse nature of outdoor point clouds. In this work, we observe a significant mitigation of this problem by accumulating multiple temporally consecutive point cloud sweeps, resulting in a remarkable improvement in perception accuracy. However, the computation cost also increases, hindering previous approaches from utilizing a large number of point cloud sweeps. To tackle this challenge, we find that a considerable portion of points in the accumulated point cloud is redundant, and discarding these points has minimal impact on perception accuracy. We introduce a simple yet effective Gumbel Spatial Pruning (GSP) layer that dynamically prunes points based on a learned end-to-end sampling. The GSP layer is decoupled from other network components and thus can be seamlessly integrated into existing point cloud network architectures. Without incurring additional computational overhead, we increase the number of point cloud sweeps from 10, a common practice, to as many as 40. Consequently, there is a significant enhancement in perception performance. For instance, in nuScenes 3D object detection and BEV map segmentation tasks, our pruning strategy improves several 3D perception baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods are limited to highway or highly simplified intersection scenarios due to the intricacy and diversity of traffic scenarios. In response, we propose Traffic Scenario Logic (TSL), which is a spatial-temporal logic designed for modeling and reasoning of urban pedestrian-free traffic scenarios. TSL provides a formal representation of the urban road network that can be derived from OpenDRIVE, i.e., the de facto industry standard of high-definition maps for autonomous driving, enabling the representation of a broad range of traffic scenarios without discretization approximations. We implemented the reasoning of TSL using Telingo, i.e., a solver for temporal programs based on Answer Set Programming, and tested it on different urban road layouts. Demonstrations show the effectiveness of TSL in test scenario generation and its potential value in areas like decision-making and control verification of autonomous driving. The code for TSL reasoning has been open-sourced.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025. 8 pages of main text, 19 pages of technical appendix</p></details> |
| **[Spatial and Frequency Domain Adaptive Fusion Network for Image Deblurring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14209v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image deblurring aims to reconstruct a latent sharp image from its corresponding blurred one. Although existing methods have achieved good performance, most of them operate exclusively in either the spatial domain or the frequency domain, rarely exploring solutions that fuse both domains. In this paper, we propose a spatial-frequency domain adaptive fusion network (SFAFNet) to address this limitation. Specifically, we design a gated spatial-frequency domain feature fusion block (GSFFBlock), which consists of three key components: a spatial domain information module, a frequency domain information dynamic generation module (FDGM), and a gated fusion module (GFM). The spatial domain information module employs the NAFBlock to integrate local information. Meanwhile, in the FDGM, we design a learnable low-pass filter that dynamically decomposes features into separate frequency subbands, capturing the image-wide receptive field and enabling the adaptive exploration of global contextual information. Additionally, to facilitate information flow and the learning of complementary representations. In the GFM, we present a gating mechanism (GATE) to re-weight spatial and frequency domain features, which are then fused through the cross-attention mechanism (CAM). Experimental results demonstrate that our SFAFNet performs favorably compared to state-of-the-art approaches on commonly used benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CarbonEdge: Leveraging Mesoscale Spatial Carbon-Intensity Variations for Low Carbon Edge Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14076v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of latency-critical and compute-intensive edge applications is driving increases in computing demand and carbon emissions at the edge. To better understand carbon emissions at the edge, we analyze granular carbon intensity traces at intermediate "mesoscales," such as within a single US state or among neighboring countries in Europe, and observe significant variations in carbon intensity at these spatial scales. Importantly, our analysis shows that carbon intensity variations, which are known to occur at large continental scales (e.g., cloud regions), also occur at much finer spatial scales, making it feasible to exploit geographic workload shifting in the edge computing context. Motivated by these findings, we propose \proposedsystem, a carbon-aware framework for edge computing that optimizes the placement of edge workloads across mesoscale edge data centers to reduce carbon emissions while meeting latency SLOs. We implement CarbonEdge and evaluate it on a real edge computing testbed and through large-scale simulations for multiple edge workloads and settings. Our experimental results on a real testbed demonstrate that CarbonEdge can reduce emissions by up to 78.7\% for a regional edge deployment in central Europe. Moreover, our CDN-scale experiments show potential savings of 49.5\% and 67.8\% in the US and Europe, respectively, while limiting the one-way latency increase to less than 5.5 ms.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel conditional diffusion model with spatial attention and latent embedding (cDAL) for medical image segmentation. In cDAL, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based discriminator is used at every time-step of the diffusion process to distinguish between the generated labels and the real ones. A spatial attention map is computed based on the features learned by the discriminator to help cDAL generate more accurate segmentation of discriminative regions in an input image. Additionally, we incorporated a random latent embedding into each layer of our model to significantly reduce the number of training and sampling time-steps, thereby making it much faster than other diffusion models for image segmentation. We applied cDAL on 3 publicly available medical image segmentation datasets (MoNuSeg, Chest X-ray and Hippocampus) and observed significant qualitative and quantitative improvements with higher Dice scores and mIoU over the state-of-the-art algorithms. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/Hejrati/cDAL/.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables, Accepted in MICCAI 2024</p></details> |

SLGPs are examined from the perspective of random measures and their densities, investigating the relationships between SLGPs and underlying processes. Our inquiries are motivated by SLGP's abilities in delivering probabilistic predictions of conditional distributions at candidate points, allowing conditional simulations of probability densities, and jointly predicting multiple functionals of target distributions. We demonstrate that SLGP models exhibit joint Gaussianity of their log-increments, enabling us to establish theoretical results regarding spatial regularity. Additionally, we extend the notion of mean-square continuity to random measure fields and establish sufficient conditions on covariance kernels underlying SLGPs to ensure these models enjoy such regularity properties. Finally, we propose an implementation using Random Fourier Features and showcase its applicability on synthetic examples and on temperature distributions at meteorological stations.</p></details> |  |
| **[BISON: Bi-clustering of spatial omics data with feature selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13453v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of next-generation sequencing-based spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) techniques has reshaped genomic studies by enabling high-throughput gene expression profiling while preserving spatial and morphological context. Understanding gene functions and interactions in different spatial domains is crucial, as it can enhance our comprehension of biological mechanisms, such as cancer-immune interactions and cell differentiation in various regions. It is necessary to cluster tissue regions into distinct spatial domains and identify discriminating genes that elucidate the clustering result, referred to as spatial domain-specific discriminating genes (DGs). Existing methods for identifying these genes typically rely on a two-stage approach, which can lead to the phenomenon known as \textit{double-dipping}. To address the challenge, we propose a unified Bayesian latent block model that simultaneously detects a list of DGs contributing to spatial domain identification while clustering these DGs and spatial locations. The efficacy of our proposed method is validated through a series of simulation experiments, and its capability to identify DGs is demonstrated through applications to benchmark SRT datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[SoFar: Language-Grounded Orientation Bridges Spatial Reasoning and Object Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13143v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial intelligence is a critical component of embodied AI, promoting robots to understand and interact with their environments. While recent advances have enhanced the ability of VLMs to perceive object locations and positional relationships, they still lack the capability to precisely understand object orientations-a key requirement for tasks involving fine-grained manipulations. Addressing this limitation not only requires geometric reasoning but also an expressive and intuitive way to represent orientation. In this context, we propose that natural language offers a more flexible representation space than canonical frames, making it particularly suitable for instruction-following robotic systems. In this paper, we introduce the concept of semantic orientation, which defines object orientations using natural language in a reference-frame-free manner (e.g., the ''plug-in'' direction of a USB or the ''handle'' direction of a knife). To support this, we construct OrienText300K, a large-scale dataset of 3D models annotated with semantic orientations that link geometric understanding to functional semantics. By integrating semantic orientation into a VLM system, we enable robots to generate manipulation actions with both positional and orientational constraints. Extensive experiments in simulation and real world demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances robotic manipulation capabilities, e.g., 48.7% accuracy on Open6DOR and 74.9% accuracy on SIMPLER.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://qizekun.github.io/sofar/</p></details> |

To facilitate VR accessibility for blind users, in this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of two types of haptic cues - vibrotactile and skin-stretch cues - in conveying the spatial information of a virtual object when applied to the dorsal side of a blind user's hand. We conducted a user study with 10 blind users to investigate how they perceive static and moving objects in VR with a custom-made haptic apparatus. Our results reveal that blind users can more accurately understand an object's location and movement when receiving skin-stretch cues, as opposed to vibrotactile cues. We discuss the pros and cons of both types of haptic cues and conclude with design recommendations for future haptic solutions for VR accessibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[TEASER: Token Enhanced Spatial Modeling for Expressions Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10982v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D facial reconstruction from a single in-the-wild image is a crucial task in human-centered computer vision tasks. While existing methods can recover accurate facial shapes, there remains significant space for improvement in fine-grained expression capture. Current approaches struggle with irregular mouth shapes, exaggerated expressions, and asymmetrical facial movements. We present TEASER (Token EnhAnced Spatial modeling for Expressions Reconstruction), which addresses these challenges and enhances 3D facial geometry performance. TEASER tackles two main limitations of existing methods: insufficient photometric loss for self-reconstruction and inaccurate localization of subtle expressions. We introduce a multi-scale tokenizer to extract facial appearance information. Combined with a neural renderer, these tokens provide precise geometric guidance for expression reconstruction. Furthermore, TEASER incorporates a pose-dependent landmark loss to further improve geometric performances. Our approach not only significantly enhances expression reconstruction quality but also offers interpretable tokens suitable for various downstream applications, such as photorealistic facial video driving, expression transfer, and identity swapping. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that TEASER achieves state-of-the-art performance in precise expression reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

In particular, interconnections between tiles are critical for high performance in these tile-based architectures. In this work, we identify the inefficiency of the widely used traditional on-chip networks and the opportunity of software-hardware co-design. We propose METRO with the basic idea of decoupling the traffic scheduling policies from hardware fabrics and moving them to the software level. METRO contains two modules working in synergy: METRO software scheduling framework to coordinate the traffics and METRO hardware facilities to deliver the data based on software configurations. We evaluate the co-design using different flit sizes for synthetic study, illustrating its effectiveness under various hardware resource constraints, in addition to a wide range of DNN models selected from real-world workloads. The results show that METRO achieves 56.3% communication speedup on average and up to 73.6% overall processing time reduction compared with traditional on-chip network designs.</p></details> |  |

However, learning self-supervised representations for spatially characterised time series, like traffic interactions, poses challenges as it requires maintaining fine-grained similarity relations in the latent space. In this study, we incorporate two structure-preserving regularisers for the contrastive learning of spatial time series: one regulariser preserves the topology of similarities between instances, and the other preserves the graph geometry of similarities across spatial and temporal dimensions. To balance contrastive learning and structure preservation, we propose a dynamic mechanism that adaptively weighs the trade-off and stabilises training. We conduct experiments on multivariate time series classification, as well as macroscopic and microscopic traffic prediction. For all three tasks, our approach preserves the structures of similarity relations more effectively and improves state-of-the-art task performances. The proposed approach can be applied to an arbitrary encoder and is particularly beneficial for time series with spatial or geographical features. Furthermore, this study suggests that higher similarity structure preservation indicates more informative and useful representations. This may help to understand the contribution of representation learning in pattern recognition with neural networks. Our code is made openly accessible with all resulting data at https://github.com/yiru-jiao/spclt.</p></details> | <details><summary>TL;DR...</summary><p>TL;DR: Preserving certain structures of similarity relations in spatio-temporal data can improve downstream task performance via contrastive learning</p></details> |

Most leading ventral stream models are derived by optimizing networks for object categorization, which seems to imply that the ventral stream is also derived under such an objective. Here, we explore an alternative hypothesis: Might the ventral stream be optimized for estimating spatial latents? And a closely related question: How different -- if at all -- are representations learned from spatial latent estimation compared to categorization? To ask these questions, we leveraged synthetic image datasets generated by a 3D graphic engine and trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to estimate different combinations of spatial and category latents. We found that models trained to estimate just a few spatial latents achieve neural alignment scores comparable to those trained on hundreds of categories, and the spatial latent performance of models strongly correlates with their neural alignment. Spatial latent and category-trained models have very similar -- but not identical -- internal representations, especially in their early and middle layers. We provide evidence that this convergence is partly driven by non-target latent variability in the training data, which facilitates the implicit learning of representations of those non-target latents. Taken together, these results suggest that many training objectives, such as spatial latents, can lead to similar models aligned neurally with the ventral stream. Thus, one should not assume that the ventral stream is optimized for object categorization only. As a field, we need to continue to sharpen our measures of comparing models to brains to better understand the functional roles of the ventral stream.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 21 figures, ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Secretion usually takes place over the cell membrane in a spatially heterogeneous manner. Mathematical models of these processes will be part of more elaborate models, e.g. of the movement of immune cells that react to cytokines in their environment. Here, we compare two approaches to modelling of the secretion-diffusion process of signalling compounds. The first is the so-called spatial exclusion model, in which the intracellular space is excluded from consideration and the computational space is the extracellular environment. The second consists of point source models, where the secreting cell is replaced by one or more non-spatial point sources or sinks, using -- mathematically -- Dirac delta distributions. We propose a multi-Dirac approach and provide explicit expressions for the intensities of the Dirac distributions. We show that two to three well-positioned Dirac points suffice to approximate well a temporally constant but spatially heterogeneous flux distribution of compound over the cell membrane, for a wide range of variation in flux density and diffusivity. The multi-Dirac approach is compared to a single-Dirac approach that was studied in previous work. Moreover, an explicit Green's function approach is introduced that has significant benefits in circumventing numerical instability that may occur when the Dirac sources have high intensities.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by recent advances in vision-language foundation models, we investigate their utility for WSTVG, leveraging their zero-shot grounding capabilities. However, we find that a simple adaptation lacks essential spatio-temporal grounding abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce Tubelet Referral Grounding (TRG), which connects textual queries to tubelets to enable spatio-temporal predictions. Despite its promise, TRG struggles with compositional action understanding and dense scene scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose STPro, a novel progressive learning framework with two key modules: (1) Sub-Action Temporal Curriculum Learning (SA-TCL), which incrementally builds compositional action understanding, and (2) Congestion-Guided Spatial Curriculum Learning (CG-SCL), which adapts the model to complex scenes by spatially increasing task difficulty. STPro achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets, with improvements of 1.0% on VidSTG-Declarative and 3.0% on HCSTVG-v1.</p></details> | CVPR'25 Conference |

To address these limitations, this paper presents the Spatio-Temporal GraphFormer framework (STGFormer) for 3D human pose estimation in videos. First, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal criss-cross Graph (STG) attention mechanism, designed to more effectively leverage the inherent graph priors of the human body within continuous sequence distributions while capturing spatiotemporal long-range dependencies. Next, we present a dual-path Modulated Hop-wise Regular GCN (MHR-GCN) to independently process temporal and spatial dimensions in parallel, preserving features rich in temporal dynamics and the original or high-dimensional representations of spatial structures. Furthermore, the module leverages modulation to optimize parameter efficiency and incorporates spatiotemporal hop-wise skip connections to capture higher-order information. Finally, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPIINF-3DHP datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[H-FLTN: A Privacy-Preserving Hierarchical Framework for Electric Vehicle Spatio-Temporal Charge Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18697v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) poses critical challenges for energy providers, particularly in predicting charging time (temporal prediction), ensuring user privacy, and managing resources efficiently in mobility-driven networks. This paper introduces the Hierarchical Federated Learning Transformer Network (H-FLTN) framework to address these challenges. H-FLTN employs a three-tier hierarchical architecture comprising EVs, community Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems (DERMS), and the Energy Provider Data Centre (EPDC) to enable accurate spatio-temporal predictions of EV charging needs while preserving privacy. Temporal prediction is enhanced using Transformer-based learning, capturing complex dependencies in charging behavior. Privacy is ensured through Secure Aggregation, Additive Secret Sharing, and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Sharing with Augmentation, which allow only secret shares of model weights to be exchanged while securing all transmissions. To improve training efficiency and resource management, H-FLTN integrates Dynamic Client Capping Mechanism (DCCM) and Client Rotation Management (CRM), ensuring that training remains both computationally and temporally efficient as the number of participating EVs increases.

Recently, advancements in monitoring technology have facilitated the effective recording of nuclear radiation levels and related factors, such as weather conditions. The abundance of monitoring data enables the development of accurate and reliable nuclear radiation forecasting models, which play a crucial role in informing decision-making for individuals and governments. However, this task is challenging due to the imbalanced distribution of monitoring stations over a wide spatial range and the non-stationary radiation variation patterns. In this study, we introduce NRFormer, a novel framework tailored for the nationwide prediction of nuclear radiation variations. By integrating a non-stationary temporal attention module, an imbalance-aware spatial attention module, and a radiation propagation prompting module, NRFormer collectively captures complex spatio-temporal dynamics of nuclear radiation. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework against 11 baselines.</p></details> |  |

The objective is to provide a quality score to ensure correct performance and achieve desired results. To achieve this goal, a new graph-based model, the Dense Spatio-Temporal Graph Conv-GRU Network with Transformer, is introduced. This model combines a modified version of STGCN and transformer architectures for efficient handling of spatio-temporal data. The key idea is to consider skeleton data respecting its non-linear structure as a graph and detecting joints playing the main role in each rehabilitation exercise. Dense connections and GRU mechanisms are used to rapidly process large 3D skeleton inputs and effectively model temporal dynamics. The transformer encoder's attention mechanism focuses on relevant parts of the input sequence, making it useful for evaluating rehabilitation exercises. The evaluation of our proposed approach on the KIMORE and UI-PRMD datasets highlighted its potential, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational time. This resulted in faster and more accurate learning and assessment of rehabilitation exercises. Additionally, our model provides valuable feedback through qualitative illustrations, effectively highlighting the significance of joints in specific exercises.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, Computers in Biology and Medicine Journal</p></details> |

However, traditional approaches to assess patient actions often rely on manual observation and scoring, which are subjective and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an automated approach for patient action assessment using a Multi-Residual Spatio Temporal Graph Network (MR-STGN) that incorporates both angular and positional 3D skeletons. The MR-STGN is specifically designed to capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of patient actions. It achieves this by integrating information from multiple residual layers, with each layer extracting features at distinct levels of abstraction. Furthermore, we integrate an attention fusion mechanism into the network, which facilitates the adaptive weighting of various features. This empowers the model to concentrate on the most pertinent aspects of the patient's movements, offering precise instructions regarding specific body parts or movements that require attention. Ablation studies are conducted to analyze the impact of individual components within the proposed model. We evaluate our model on the UI-PRMD dataset demonstrating its performance in accurately predicting real-time patient action scores, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, maintaining its adaptability under diverse object properties and complex working conditions remains challenging. This article highlights the importance of completely representing spatio-temporal features of slip, and proposes a novel approach for incipient slip modeling and detection. Based on the analysis of localized displacement phenomenon, we establish the relationship between the characteristic strain rate extreme events and the local slip state. This approach enables the detection of both the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of stick-slip regions. Also, the proposed method can be applied to strain distribution sensing devices, such as vision-based tactile sensors. Simulations and prototype experiments validated the effectiveness of this approach under varying contact conditions, including different contact geometries, friction coefficients, and combined loads. Experiments demonstrated that this method not only accurately and reliably delineates incipient slip, but also facilitates friction parameter estimation and adaptive grasping control.</p></details> | 21 pages, 19 figures |

However, most approaches are based on the assumption of the availability of and accessibility to a sufficiently dense data source, which is rather the rare case in reality. Traffic sensors in road networks are generally highly sparse in their distribution: fleet-based traffic sensing is sparse in space but also sparse in time. There are also other traffic application, besides road traffic, like moving objects in the marine space, where observations are sparsely and arbitrarily distributed in space. In this paper, we tackle the problem of traffic prediction on sparse and spatially irregular and non-deterministic traffic observations. We draw a border between imputations and this work as we consider high sparsity rates and no fixed sensor locations. We advance correlation mining methods with a Sparse Unstructured Spatio Temporal Reconstruction (SUSTeR) framework that reconstructs traffic states from sparse non-stationary observations. For the prediction the framework creates a hidden context traffic state which is enriched in a residual fashion with each observation. Such an assimilated hidden traffic state can be used by existing traffic prediction methods to predict future traffic states. We query these states with query locations from the spatial domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted and presented at ACM SIGSPATIAL '23</p></details> |

However, existing whole-body-object interaction video benchmarks overlook the truth that open-world objects are diverse, that is, they usually provide limited and predefined object classes. Therefore, we introduce a new open-world benchmark: Grounding Interacted Objects (GIO) including 1,098 interacted objects class and 290K interacted object boxes annotation. Accordingly, an object grounding task is proposed expecting vision systems to discover interacted objects. Even though today's detectors and grounding methods have succeeded greatly, they perform unsatisfactorily in localizing diverse and rare objects in GIO. This profoundly reveals the limitations of current vision systems and poses a great challenge. Thus, we explore leveraging spatio-temporal cues to address object grounding and propose a 4D question-answering framework (4D-QA) to discover interacted objects from diverse videos. Our method demonstrates significant superiority in extensive experiments compared to current baselines.

HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, which meet the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges, such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STAD) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which are then used as conditional inputs to direct the reverse denoising process. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the STAD significantly enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STAD demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks, indicating their potential to substantially boost the spatial resolution of EEG.</p></details> |  |

With around 2000 ball events per game, their precise and exhaustive annotation based on a monocular video stream remains a tedious and costly manual task. While state-of-the-art spatio-temporal action detection methods show promise for automating this task, they lack contextual understanding of the game. Assuming professional players' behaviors are interdependent, we hypothesize that incorporating surrounding players' information such as positions, velocity and team membership can enhance purely visual predictions. We propose a spatio-temporal action detection approach that combines visual and game state information via Graph Neural Networks trained end-to-end with state-of-the-art 3D CNNs, demonstrating improved metrics through game state integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[LEAP: Enhancing Vision-Based Occupancy Networks with Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Correlation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15438v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-based occupancy networks provide an end-to-end solution for reconstructing the surrounding environment using semantic occupied voxels derived from multi-view images. This technique relies on effectively learning the correlation between pixel-level visual information and voxels. Despite recent advancements, occupancy results still suffer from limited accuracy due to occlusions and sparse visual cues. To address this, we propose a Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Correlation (LEAP)} method, which significantly enhances the performance of existing occupancy networks with minimal computational overhead. LEAP can be seamlessly integrated into various baseline networks, enabling a plug-and-play application. LEAP operates in three stages: 1) it tokenizes information from recent baseline and motion features into a shared, compact latent space; 2) it establishes full correlation through a tri-stream fusion architecture; 3) it generates occupancy results that strengthen the baseline's output. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method, outperforming the latest baseline models. The source code and several demos are available in the supplementary material.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Fixed Variables: Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting via Flat Scheme and Spatio-temporal Focal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15296v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) has long been a key research focus. Traditionally, these studies assume a fixed number of variables, but in real-world applications, Cyber-Physical Systems often expand as new sensors are deployed, increasing variables in MTSF. In light of this, we introduce a novel task, Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting (EVTSF). This task presents unique challenges, specifically (1) handling inconsistent data shapes caused by adding new variables, and (2) addressing imbalanced spatio-temporal learning, where expanding variables have limited observed data due to the necessity for timely operation. To address these challenges, we propose STEV, a flexible spatio-temporal forecasting framework. STEV includes a new Flat Scheme to tackle the inconsistent data shape issue, which extends the graph-based spatio-temporal modeling architecture into 1D space by flattening the 2D samples along the variable dimension, making the model variable-scale-agnostic while still preserving dynamic spatial correlations through a holistic graph. We introduce a novel Spatio-temporal Focal Learning strategy that incorporates a negative filter to resolve potential conflicts between contrastive learning and graph representation, and a focal contrastive loss as its core to guide the framework to focus on optimizing the expanding variables. We benchmark EVTSF performance using three real-world datasets and compare it against three potential solutions employing SOTA MTSF models tailored for EVSTF. Experimental results show that STEV significantly outperforms its competitors, particularly on expanding variables. Notably, STEV, with only 5% of observations from the expanding period, is on par with SOTA MTSF models trained with complete observations. Further exploration of various expanding strategies underscores the generalizability of STEV in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from the stochastic processes associated with the particle labels. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over a large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the limiting dynamics of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</p></details> |  |

Compared with the traditional trajectory composed of a set of point-estimates obtained by a tracker in the measurement time-series, the trajectory that our series of studies including this paper pursued is given by a curve function of time (FoT). The trajectory FoT provides complete information of the movement of the target over time and can be used to infer the state corresponding to arbitrary time, not only at the measurement time. However, there are no metrics available for comparing and evaluating the trajectory FoT. To address this lacuna, we propose a metric denominated as the spatiotemporal-aligned trajectory integral distance (Star-ID). The StarID associates and aligns the estimated and actual trajectories in the spatio-temporal domain and distinguishes between the time-aligned and unaligned segments in calculating the spatial divergence including false alarm, miss-detection and localization errors. The effectiveness of the proposed distance metric and the time-averaged version is validated through theoretical analysis and numerical examples of a single target or multiple targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Part ...</summary><p>Part I of a series of companion papers; 11 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) sequences, recognized as the gold standard for diagnosing CVDs, can clearly visualize the dynamic flow and reveal pathological conditions within the cerebrovasculature. Therefore, precise segmentation of cerebral arteries (CAs) and classification between their main trunks and branches are crucial for physicians to accurately quantify diseases. However, achieving accurate CA segmentation in DSA sequences remains a challenging task due to small vessels with low contrast, and ambiguity between vessels and residual skull structures. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets limits exploration in the field. In this paper, we introduce a DSA Sequence-based Cerebral Artery segmentation dataset (DSCA), the publicly accessible dataset designed specifically for pixel-level semantic segmentation of CAs. Additionally, we propose DSANet, a spatio-temporal network for CA segmentation in DSA sequences. Unlike existing DSA segmentation methods that focus only on a single frame, the proposed DSANet introduces a separate temporal encoding branch to capture dynamic vessel details across multiple frames. To enhance small vessel segmentation and improve vessel connectivity, we design a novel TemporalFormer module to capture global context and correlations among sequential frames. Furthermore, we develop a Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) module to effectively integrate spatial and temporal features from the encoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSANet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in CA segmentation, achieving a Dice of 0.9033.</p></details> | Published by TMI |

However, existing approaches often produce overly conservative uncertainty intervals at individual spatial units and fail to properly capture uncertainties when aggregating predictions across different spatial scales. This paper presents a novel hierarchical spatio-temporal model based on the conformal prediction framework to address these challenges. Our approach generates circuit-level DER growth predictions and efficiently aggregates them to the substation level while maintaining statistical validity through a tailored non-conformity score. Applied to a decade of DER installation data from a local utility network, our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches, particularly in reducing prediction interval widths while maintaining coverage.</p></details> |  |

We propose an adaptive, AI-driven spectrum-sharing framework within the O-RAN architecture, integrating discriminative and generative AI (GenAI) to forecast spectrum needs across multiple timescales and spatial granularities. A marketplace model, managed by an authorized spectrum broker, enables operators to trade spectrum dynamically, balancing static assignments with real-time trading. GenAI enhances traffic prediction, spectrum estimation, and allocation, optimizing utilization while reducing costs. This modular, flexible approach fosters operator collaboration, maximizing efficiency and revenue. A key research challenge is refining allocation granularity and spatio-temporal dynamics beyond existing models.</p></details> |  |

We also give accompanying structure preserving time discretizations for Lie--Poisson systems on the dual of semi-direct product Lie algebras of the form $\mathfrak{f}=\mathfrak{g}\ltimes\mathfrak{g^{*}}$, where $\mathfrak{g}$ is a $J$-quadratic Lie algebra. The time integration method is free of computationally costly matrix exponentials. We prove that the full method preserves a modified Lie--Poisson structure and corresponding Casimir functions, and that the modified structure and Casimirs converge to the continuous ones.

We propose AQ-Net, a spatiotemporal reanalysis model for both observed and unobserved stations in the near future. AQ-Net utilizes the LSTM and multi-head attention for the temporal regression. We also propose a cyclic encoding technique to ensure continuous time representation. To learn fine-grained spatial air quality estimation, we incorporate AQ-Net with the neural kNN to explore feature-based interpolation, such that we can fill the spatial gaps given coarse observation stations. To demonstrate the efficiency of our model for spatiotemporal reanalysis, we use data from 2013-2017 collected in northern China for PM2.5 analysis. Extensive experiments show that AQ-Net excels in air quality reanalysis, highlighting the potential of hybrid spatio-temporal models to better capture environmental dynamics, especially in urban areas where both spatial and temporal variability are critical.</p></details> |  |

Existing spatio-temporal data secure retrieval schemes have significant shortcomings regarding dynamic updates, either compromising privacy through leakage during updates (forward insecurity) or incurring excessively high update costs that hinder practical application. Under these circumstances, we first propose a basic filter-based spatio-temporal range query scheme \TrinityI that supports low-cost dynamic updates and automatic expansion. Furthermore, to improve security, reduce storage cost, and false positives, we propose a forward secure and verifiable scheme \TrinityII that simultaneously minimizes storage overhead. A formal security analysis proves that \TrinityI and \TrinityII are Indistinguishable under Selective Chosen-Plaintext Attack (IND-SCPA). Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our design \TrinityII significantly reduces storage requirements by 80\%, enables data retrieval at the 1 million-record level in just 0.01 seconds, and achieves 10 $\times$ update efficiency than state-of-art.</p></details> | 14pages,6 figures |

To achieve this goal, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Memory Agent (STMA), a novel framework designed to enhance task planning and execution by integrating spatio-temporal memory. STMA is built upon three critical components: (1) a spatio-temporal memory module that captures historical and environmental changes in real time, (2) a dynamic knowledge graph that facilitates adaptive spatial reasoning, and (3) a planner-critic mechanism that iteratively refines task strategies. We evaluate STMA in the TextWorld environment on 32 tasks, involving multi-step planning and exploration under varying levels of complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that STMA achieves a 31.25% improvement in success rate and a 24.7% increase in average score compared to the state-of-the-art model.

Naturally, automated detection of forged Deepfake videos is attracting a proportional amount of interest of researchers. Current methods for detecting forged videos mainly rely on global frame features and under-utilize the spatio-temporal inconsistencies found in the manipulated videos. Moreover, they fail to attend to manipulation-specific subtle and well-localized pattern variations along both spatial and temporal dimensions. Addressing these gaps, we propose a neural Deepfake detector that focuses on the localized manipulative signatures of the forged videos at individual frame level as well as frame sequence level. Using a ResNet backbone, it strengthens the shallow frame-level feature learning with a spatial attention mechanism. The spatial stream of the model is further helped by fusing texture enhanced shallow features with the deeper features. Simultaneously, the model processes frame sequences with a distance attention mechanism that further allows fusion of temporal attention maps with the learned features at the deeper layers. The overall model is trained to detect forged content as a classifier. We evaluate our method on two popular large data sets and achieve significant performance over the state-of-the-art methods.Moreover, our technique also provides memory and computational advantages over the competitive techniques.</p></details> |  |

Full-scale resolving simulations for systems such as highly turbulent flows are not feasible in the foreseeable future, and reduced-order models must capture dynamics that involve interactions across scales. In the present work, we propose a novel framework, Graph-based Learning of Effective Dynamics (Graph-LED), that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs), as well as an attention-based autoregressive model, to extract the effective dynamics from a small amount of simulation data. GNNs represent flow fields on unstructured meshes as graphs and effectively handle complex geometries and non-uniform grids. The proposed method combines a GNN based, dimensionality reduction for variable-size unstructured meshes with an autoregressive temporal attention model that can learn temporal dependencies automatically. We evaluated the proposed approach on a suite of fluid dynamics problems, including flow past a cylinder and flow over a backward-facing step over a range of Reynolds numbers. The results demonstrate robust and effective forecasting of spatio-temporal physics; in the case of the flow past a cylinder, both small-scale effects that occur close to the cylinder as well as its wake are accurately captured.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference on Parsimony and Learning (CPAL)</p></details> |

In particular, ride-hailing vehicles can effectively facilitate flexible data collection and contribute towards urban intelligence, despite resource limitations. Therefore, this work explores a promising scenario, where edge-assisted vehicles perform joint tasks of order serving and the emerging foundation model fine-tuning using various urban data. However, integrating the VCS AI task with the conventional order serving task is challenging, due to their inconsistent spatio-temporal characteristics: (i) The distributions of ride orders and data point-of-interests (PoIs) may not coincide in geography, both following a priori unknown patterns; (ii) they have distinct forms of temporal effects, i.e., prolonged waiting makes orders become instantly invalid while data with increased staleness gradually reduces its utility for model fine-tuning.To overcome these obstacles, we propose an online framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with careful augmentation. A new quality-of-service (QoS) metric is designed to characterize and balance the utility of the two joint tasks, under the effects of varying data volumes and staleness. We also integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) with MARL to enhance state representations, capturing graph-structured, time-varying dependencies among vehicles and across locations. Extensive experiments on our testbed simulator, utilizing various real-world foundation model fine-tuning tasks and the New York City Taxi ride order dataset, demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenSTARLab: Open Approach for Spatio-Temporal Agent Data Analysis in Soccer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02785v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sports analytics has become both more professional and sophisticated, driven by the growing availability of detailed performance data. This progress enables applications such as match outcome prediction, player scouting, and tactical analysis. In soccer, the effective utilization of event and tracking data is fundamental for capturing and analyzing the dynamics of the game. However, there are two primary challenges: the limited availability of event data, primarily restricted to top-tier teams and leagues, and the scarcity and high cost of tracking data, which complicates its integration with event data for comprehensive analysis. Here we propose OpenSTARLab, an open-source framework designed to democratize spatio-temporal agent data analysis in sports by addressing these key challenges. OpenSTARLab includes the Pre-processing Package that standardizes event and tracking data through Unified and Integrated Event Data and State-Action-Reward formats, the Event Modeling Package that implements deep learning-based event prediction, alongside the RLearn Package for reinforcement learning tasks. These technical components facilitate the handling of diverse data sources and support advanced analytical tasks, thereby enhancing the overall functionality and usability of the framework. To assess OpenSTARLab's effectiveness, we conducted several experimental evaluations. These demonstrate the superior performance of the specific event prediction model in terms of action and time prediction accuracies and maintained its robust event simulation performance. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments reveal a trade-off between action accuracy and temporal difference loss and show comprehensive visualization. Overall, OpenSTARLab serves as a robust platform for researchers and practitioners, enhancing innovation and collaboration in the field of soccer data analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>OpenS...</summary><p>OpenSTARLab is available at https://github.com/open-starlab, and its documentation can be found at https://openstarlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</p></details> |

This task is however challenging due to multiple sign variations, complexity in language and inherent richness of expressions. Computational approaches have evidenced capabilities to support SLT. Nonetheless, these approaches remain limited to cover gestures variability and support long sequence translations. This paper introduces a Transformer-based architecture that encodes spatio-temporal motion gestures, preserving both local and long-range spatial information through the use of multiple convolutional and attention mechanisms. The proposed approach was validated on the Colombian Sign Language Translation Dataset (CoL-SLTD) outperforming baseline approaches, and achieving a BLEU4 of 46.84%. Additionally, the proposed approach was validated on the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T (PHOENIX14T), achieving a BLEU4 score of 30.77%, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in handling real-world variations</p></details> |  |

It is a multimodal task aimed at localizing specific subjects spatio-temporally based on textual queries without bounding box supervision. Motivated by recent advancements in multi-modal foundation models for grounding tasks, we first explore the potential of state-of-the-art object detection models for WSTVG. Despite their robust zero-shot capabilities, our adaptation reveals significant limitations, including inconsistent temporal predictions, inadequate understanding of complex queries, and challenges in adapting to difficult scenarios. We propose CoSPaL (Contextual Self-Paced Learning), a novel approach which is designed to overcome these limitations. CoSPaL integrates three core components: (1) Tubelet Phrase Grounding (TPG), which introduces spatio-temporal prediction by linking textual queries to tubelets; (2) Contextual Referral Grounding (CRG), which improves comprehension of complex queries by extracting contextual information to refine object identification over time; and (3) Self-Paced Scene Understanding (SPS), a training paradigm that progressively increases task difficulty, enabling the model to adapt to complex scenarios by transitioning from coarse to fine-grained understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR'...</summary><p>ICLR'25 Main Conference.

In this paper, we adapt and specialise the robust and conjugate GP (RCGP) framework of Altamirano et al. (2024) to the spatio-temporal setting. In doing so, we obtain an outlier-robust spatio-temporal GP with a computational cost comparable to classical spatio-temporal GPs. We also overcome the three main drawbacks of RCGPs: their unreliable performance when the prior mean is chosen poorly, their lack of reliable uncertainty quantification, and the need to carefully select a hyperparameter by hand. We study our method extensively in finance and weather forecasting applications, demonstrating that it provides a reliable approach to spatio-temporal modelling in the presence of outliers.</p></details> |  |

We further introduce the TUMTraffic-Qwen baseline model, enhanced with visual token sampling strategies, providing valuable insights into the challenges of fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the dataset's complexity, highlight the limitations of existing models, and position TUMTraffic-VideoQA as a robust foundation for advancing research in intelligent transportation systems.

| **[Automated Extraction of Spatio-Semantic Graphs for Identifying Cognitive Impairment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01685v1)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing methods for analyzing linguistic content from picture descriptions for assessment of cognitive-linguistic impairment often overlook the participant's visual narrative path, which typically requires eye tracking to assess. Spatio-semantic graphs are a useful tool for analyzing this narrative path from transcripts alone, however they are limited by the need for manual tagging of content information units (CIUs). In this paper, we propose an automated approach for estimation of spatio-semantic graphs (via automated extraction of CIUs) from the Cookie Theft picture commonly used in cognitive-linguistic analyses. The method enables the automatic characterization of the visual semantic path during picture description. Experiments demonstrate that the automatic spatio-semantic graphs effectively differentiate between cognitively impaired and unimpaired speakers. Statistical analyses reveal that the features derived by the automated method produce comparable results to the manual method, with even greater group differences between clinical groups of interest. These results highlight the potential of the automated approach for extracting spatio-semantic features in developing clinical speech models for cognitive impairment assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

For this purpose, spatial homogeneity and temporal stationarity are widely used assumptions, and many parametric covariance models have been developed under these assumptions. However, these are strong and unrealistic conditions in many cases. In addition, on the sphere, although different statistical approaches from those on Euclidean space should be applied to build a proper covariance model considering its unique characteristics, relevant studies are rare. In this research, we introduce novel parameterized models of the covariance function for spatially non-homogeneous and temporally non-stationary random processes on the sphere. To alleviate the spatial homogeneity assumption and temporal stationarity, and to consider the spherical domain and time domain together, this research will apply the theories of Intrinsic Random Functions (IRF). We also provide a methodology to estimate the associated parameters for the model. Finally, through a simulation study and analysis of a real-world data set about global temperature anomaly, we demonstrate validity of the suggested covariance model with its advantage of interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Existing state-of-the-art methods, like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), achieve high imputation accuracy; however, they suffer from significant computational costs and are notably time-consuming due to their iterative nature. In this work, we propose CoSTI, an innovative adaptation of Consistency Models (CMs) for the MTSI domain. CoSTI employs Consistency Training to achieve comparable imputation quality to DDPMs while drastically reducing inference times, making it more suitable for real-time applications. We evaluate CoSTI across multiple datasets and missing data scenarios, demonstrating up to a 98% reduction in imputation time with performance on par with diffusion-based models. This work bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in generative imputation tasks, providing a scalable solution for handling missing data in critical spatio-temporal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Deep Spatio-Temporal Architecture for Dynamic Effective Connectivity Network Analysis Based on Dynamic Causal Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18859v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic effective connectivity networks (dECNs) reveal the changing directed brain activity and the dynamic causal influences among brain regions, which facilitate the identification of individual differences and enhance the understanding of human brain. Although the existing causal discovery methods have shown promising results in effective connectivity network analysis, they often overlook the dynamics of causality, in addition to the incorporation of spatio-temporal information in brain activity data. To address these issues, we propose a deep spatio-temporal fusion architecture, which employs a dynamic causal deep encoder to incorporate spatio-temporal information into dynamic causality modeling, and a dynamic causal deep decoder to verify the discovered causality. The effectiveness of the proposed method is first illustrated with simulated data. Then, experimental results from Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in inferring dECNs, which reveal the dynamic evolution of directed flow between brain regions. The analysis shows the difference of dECNs between young adults and children. Specifically, the directed brain functional networks transit from fluctuating undifferentiated systems to more stable specialized networks as one grows. This observation provides further evidence on the modularization and adaptation of brain networks during development, leading to higher cognitive abilities observed in young adults.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation for unbiased cross-validation of spatio-temporal models for species distribution modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03480v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Species Distribution Models (SDMs) often suffer from spatial autocorrelation (SAC), leading to biased performance estimates. We tested cross-validation (CV) strategies - random splits, spatial blocking with varied distances, environmental (ENV) clustering, and a novel spatio-temporal method - under two proposed training schemes: LAST FOLD, widely used in spatial CV at the cost of data loss, and RETRAIN, which maximizes data usage but risks reintroducing SAC. LAST FOLD consistently yielded lower errors and stronger correlations. Spatial blocking at an optimal distance (SP 422) and ENV performed best, achieving Spearman and Pearson correlations of 0.485 and 0.548, respectively, although ENV may be unsuitable for long-term forecasts involving major environmental shifts. A spatio-temporal approach yielded modest benefits in our moderately variable dataset, but may excel with stronger temporal changes. These findings highlight the need to align CV approaches with the spatial and temporal structure of SDM data, ensuring rigorous validation and reliable predictive outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Classification of Mild Cognitive Impairment Based on Dynamic Functional Connectivity Using Spatio-Temporal Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16409v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is an advanced technique for capturing the dynamic changes of neural activities, and can be very useful in the studies of brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, existing studies have not fully leveraged the sequential information embedded within dFC that can potentially provide valuable information when identifying brain conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that jointly learns the embedding of both spatial and temporal information within dFC based on the transformer architecture. Specifically, we first construct dFC networks from rs-fMRI data through a sliding window strategy. Then, we simultaneously employ a temporal block and a spatial block to capture higher-order representations of dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies, via mapping them into an efficient fused feature representation. To further enhance the robustness of these feature representations by reducing the dependency on labeled data, we also introduce a contrastive learning strategy to manipulate different brain states. Experimental results on 345 subjects with 570 scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method for MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment, the prodromal stage of AD) prediction, highlighting its potential for early identification of AD.</p></details> |  |

Rabies is a prominent example with various instances globally, facilitated by a surplus of meso-predators (commonly, facultative synanthropic species e.g., golden jackals [Canis aureus, hereafter jackals]) thanks to the abundance of anthropogenic resources leading to dense populations close to human establishments. To mitigate rabies outbreaks and prevent human infections, authorities target the jackal which is the main rabies vector in many regions, through the dissemination of oral vaccines in known jackals' activity centers, as well as opportunistic culling to reduce population density. Because dilution (i.e., culling) is not selective towards sick or un-vaccinated individuals, these two complementary epizootic intervention policies (EIPs) can interfere with each other. Nonetheless, there is only limited examination of the interactive effectiveness of these EIPs and their potential influence on rabies epizootic spread dynamics, highlighting the need to understand these measures and the spread of rabies in wild jackals. In this study, we introduce a novel spatio-temporal extended-SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model with a graph-based spatial framework for evaluating mitigation efficiency. We implement the model in a case study using a jackal population in northern Israel, and using spatial and movement data collected by Advanced Tracking and Localization of Animals in real-life Systems (ATLAS) telemetry. An agent-based simulation approach allows us to explore various biologically-realistic scenarios, and assess the impact of different EIPs configurations. Our model suggests that under biologically-realistic underlying assumptions and scenarios, the effectiveness of both EIPs is not influenced much by the jackal population size but is sensitive to their dispersal between activity centers.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-temporal Graph Network Allowing Incomplete Trajectory Input for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13973v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is important in the research of mobile robot navigation in environments with pedestrians. Most pedestrian trajectory prediction algorithms require the input historical trajectories to be complete. If a pedestrian is unobservable in any frame in the past, then its historical trajectory become incomplete, the algorithm will not predict its future trajectory. To address this limitation, we propose the STGN-IT, a spatio-temporal graph network allowing incomplete trajectory input, which can predict the future trajectories of pedestrians with incomplete historical trajectories. STGN-IT uses the spatio-temporal graph with an additional encoding method to represent the historical trajectories and observation states of pedestrians. Moreover, STGN-IT introduces static obstacles in the environment that may affect the future trajectories as nodes to further improve the prediction accuracy. A clustering algorithm is also applied in the construction of spatio-temporal graphs. Experiments on public datasets show that STGN-IT outperforms state of the art algorithms on these metrics.</p></details> |  |

However, existing GCN-based methods face critical limitations: (1) they lack effective spatio-temporal topology modeling that captures dynamic variations in skeletal motion, and (2) they struggle to model multiscale structural relationships beyond local joint connectivity. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Semantic Awareness Graph Convolutional Network (DSTSA-GCN). DSTSA-GCN introduces three key modules: Group Channel-wise Graph Convolution (GC-GC), Group Temporal-wise Graph Convolution (GT-GC), and Multi-Scale Temporal Convolution (MS-TCN). GC-GC and GT-GC operate in parallel to independently model channel-specific and frame-specific correlations, enabling robust topology learning that accounts for temporal variations. Additionally, both modules employ a grouping strategy to adaptively capture multiscale structural relationships. Complementing this, MS-TCN enhances temporal modeling through group-wise temporal convolutions with diverse receptive fields. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSTSA-GCN significantly improves the topology modeling capabilities of GCNs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets for gesture and action recognition, including SHREC17 Track, DHG-14\/28, NTU-RGB+D, and NTU-RGB+D-120.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submit to Neurocomputing</p></details> |

In this regard, covariance properties with respect to geometric image transformations in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy are essential for expressing robust image operations, and for formulating invariant visual operations at higher levels. This paper defines and proves a set of joint covariance properties for spatio-temporal receptive fields in terms of spatio-temporal derivative operators applied to spatio-temporally smoothed image data under compositions of spatial scaling transformations, spatial affine transformations, Galilean transformations and temporal scaling transformations. Specifically, the derived relations show how the parameters of the receptive fields need to be transformed, in order to match the output from spatio-temporal receptive fields under composed spatio-temporal image transformations. For this purpose, we also fundamentally extend the notion of scale-normalized derivatives to affine-normalized derivatives, that are computed based on spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels, and analyze the covariance properties of the resulting affine-normalized derivatives for the affine group as well as for important subgroups thereof. We conclude with a geometric analysis, showing how the derived joint covariance properties make it possible to relate or match spatio-temporal receptive field responses, when observing, possibly moving, local surface patches from different views, under locally linearized perspective or projective transformations, as well as when observing different instances of spatio-temporal events, that may occur either faster or slower between different views of similar spatio-temporal events.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 19 figures.

The sound generated by vessels can have various adverse effects on fish and aquatic ecosystems in general. In this setting, the estimation and analysis of the underwater noise produced by vessels is an important challenge for the preservation of the marine environment. In this paper we propose a model for the spatio-temporal characterisation of the underwater noise generated by vessels. The approach is based on the reconstruction of the vessels' trajectories from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and on their deployment in a spatio-temporal database. Trajectories are enriched with semantic information like the acoustic characteristics of the vessels' engines or the activity performed by the vessels. We define a model for underwater noise propagation and use the trajectories' information to infer how noise propagates in the area of interest. We develop our approach for the case study of the fishery activities in the Northern Adriatic sea, an area of the Mediterranean sea which is well known to be highly exploited. We implement our approach using MobilityDB, an open source geospatial trajectory data management and analysis platform, which offers spatio-temporal operators and indexes improving the efficiency of our system. We use this platform to conduct various analyses of the underwater noise generated in the Northern Adriatic Sea, aiming at estimating the impact of fishing activities on underwater noise pollution and at demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Different regions in the area exhibit different characteristics while having latent correlations. This spatial heterogeneity and correlations greatly affect the spatio-temporal distributions of event occurrences, which has not been addressed by state-of-the-art models. Learning spatial dependencies of events in a continuous space is challenging due to its fine granularity and a lack of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a novel Graph Spatio-Temporal Point Process (GSTPP) model for fine-grained event prediction. It adopts an encoder-decoder architecture that jointly models the state dynamics of spatially localized regions using neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). The state evolution is built on the foundation of a novel Self-Adaptive Anchor Graph (SAAG) that captures spatial dependencies. By adaptively localizing the anchor nodes in the space and jointly constructing the correlation edges between them, the SAAG enhances the model's ability of learning complex spatial event patterns. The proposed GSTPP model greatly improves the accuracy of fine-grained event prediction. Extensive experimental results show that our method greatly improves the prediction accuracy over existing spatio-temporal event prediction approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIAM International Conference on Data Mining 2025 (SDM'25)</p></details> |

Multi-sensor synchronous measurement has proven to be more effective for WHAR than using a single sensor. However, existing WHAR methods use shared convolutional kernels for indiscriminate temporal feature extraction across each sensor variable, which fails to effectively capture spatio-temporal relationships of intra-sensor and inter-sensor variables. We propose the DecomposeWHAR model consisting of a decomposition phase and a fusion phase to better model the relationships between modality variables. The decomposition creates high-dimensional representations of each intra-sensor variable through the improved Depth Separable Convolution to capture local temporal features while preserving their unique characteristics. The fusion phase begins by capturing relationships between intra-sensor variables and fusing their features at both the channel and variable levels. Long-range temporal dependencies are modeled using the State Space Model (SSM), and later cross-sensor interactions are dynamically captured through a self-attention mechanism, highlighting inter-sensor spatial correlations. Our model demonstrates superior performance on three widely used WHAR datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models while maintaining acceptable computational efficiency. Our codes and supplementary materials are available at https://github.com/Anakin2555/DecomposeWHAR.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods still suffer from noisy and inconsistent flow matching, making it difficult to handle challenging scenarios and long-sequence estimation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Spatio-Temporal Visual Odometry (STVO), a novel deep network architecture that effectively leverages inherent spatio-temporal cues to enhance the accuracy and consistency of multi-frame flow matching. With more accurate and consistent flow matching, STVO can achieve better pose estimation through the bundle adjustment (BA). Specifically, STVO introduces two innovative components: 1) the Temporal Propagation Module that utilizes multi-frame information to extract and propagate temporal cues across adjacent frames, maintaining temporal consistency; 2) the Spatial Activation Module that utilizes geometric priors from the depth maps to enhance spatial consistency while filtering out excessive noise and incorrect matches. Our STVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on TUM-RGBD, EuRoc MAV, ETH3D and KITTI Odometry benchmarks. Notably, it improves accuracy by 77.8% on ETH3D benchmark and 38.9% on KITTI Odometry benchmark over the previous best methods.</p></details> |  |

Most recent approaches rely on binary classifiers trained on both real and fake data. However, such methods may struggle to focus on important artifacts, which can hinder their generalization capability. Additionally, these models often lack interpretability, making it difficult to understand how predictions are made. To address these issues, we propose FakeSTormer, offering two key contributions. First, we introduce a multi-task learning framework with additional spatial and temporal branches that enable the model to focus on subtle spatio-temporal artifacts. These branches also provide interpretability by highlighting video regions that may contain artifacts. Second, we propose a video-level data synthesis algorithm that generates pseudo-fake videos with subtle artifacts, providing the model with high-quality samples and ground truth data for our spatial and temporal branches. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate the competitiveness of our approach compared to recent state-of-the-art methods.

Concretely, earth science systems rely heavily on the extensive deployment of sensors, however, the data collection from sensors is constrained by complex geographical and social factors, making it challenging to achieve comprehensive coverage and uniform deployment. To alleviate the obstacle, traditional approaches to sensor deployment utilize specific algorithms to design and deploy sensors. These methods \textit{dynamically adjust the activation times of sensors to optimize the detection process across each sub-region}. Regrettably, formulating an activation strategy generally based on historical observations and geographic characteristics, which make the methods and resultant models were neither simple nor practical. Worse still, the complex technical design may ultimately lead to a model with weak generalizability. In this paper, we introduce for the first time the concept of spatio-temporal data dynamic sparse training and are committed to adaptively, dynamically filtering important sensor distributions. To our knowledge, this is the \textbf{first} proposal (\textit{termed DynST}) of an \textbf{industry-level} deployment optimization concept at the data level. However, due to the existence of the temporal dimension, pruning of spatio-temporal data may lead to conflicts at different timestamps. To achieve this goal, we employ dynamic merge technology, along with ingenious dimensional mapping to mitigate potential impacts caused by the temporal aspect. During the training process, DynST utilize iterative pruning and sparse training, repeatedly identifying and dynamically removing sensor perception areas that contribute the least to future predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Get Rid of Isolation: A Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10524v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal learning has become a pivotal technique to enable urban intelligence. Traditional spatiotemporal models mostly focus on a specific task by assuming a same distribution between training and testing sets. However, given that urban systems are usually dynamic, multi-sourced with imbalanced data distributions, current specific task-specific models fail to generalize to new urban conditions and adapt to new domains without explicitly modeling interdependencies across various dimensions and types of urban data. To this end, we argue that there is an essential to propose a Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal learning framework (CMuST) to empower collective urban intelligence, which reforms the urban spatiotemporal learning from single-domain to cooperatively multi-dimensional and multi-task learning. Specifically, CMuST proposes a new multi-dimensional spatiotemporal interaction network (MSTI) to allow cross-interactions between context and main observations as well as self-interactions within spatial and temporal aspects to be exposed, which is also the core for capturing task-level commonality and personalization. To ensure continuous task learning, a novel Rolling Adaptation training scheme (RoAda) is devised, which not only preserves task uniqueness by constructing data summarization-driven task prompts, but also harnesses correlated patterns among tasks by iterative model behavior modeling. We further establish a benchmark of three cities for multi-task spatiotemporal learning, and empirically demonstrate the superiority of CMuST via extensive evaluations on these datasets.

Point processes specified on linear networks can provide a more accurate description of crime incidents by considering the geometry of the city. We propose a spatio-temporal Dirichlet process mixture model on a linear network to analyze crime events in Valencia, Spain. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model with a Dirichlet process prior to automatically detect space-time clusters of the events and adopt a convolution kernel estimator to account for the network structure in the city. From the fitted model, we provide crime hotspot visualizations that can inform social interventions to prevent crime incidents. Furthermore, we study the relationships between the detected cluster centers and the city's amenities, which provides an intuitive explanation of criminal contagion.</p></details> |  |

Recently, we have witnessed the rise of variational autoencoder-based latent factor models, which learn latent factors self-adaptively. While these models focus on modeling overall market conditions, they often fail to effectively capture the temporal patterns of individual stocks. Additionally, representing multiple factors as single values simplifies the model but limits its ability to capture complex relationships and dependencies. As a result, the learned factors are of low quality and lack diversity, reducing their effectiveness and robustness across different trading periods. To address these issues, we propose a Spatio-Temporal factOR Model based on dual vector quantized variational autoencoders, named STORM, which extracts features of stocks from temporal and spatial perspectives, then fuses and aligns these features at the fine-grained and semantic level, and represents the factors as multi-dimensional embeddings. The discrete codebooks cluster similar factor embeddings, ensuring orthogonality and diversity, which helps distinguish between different factors and enables factor selection in financial trading. To show the performance of the proposed factor model, we apply it to two downstream experiments: portfolio management on two stock datasets and individual trading tasks on six specific stocks. The extensive experiments demonstrate STORM's flexibility in adapting to downstream tasks and superior performance over baseline models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Traffic Prediction Through Spatio-Temporal Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10459v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained considerable attention in recent years for traffic flow prediction due to their ability to learn spatio-temporal pattern representations through a graph-based message-passing framework. Although GNNs have shown great promise in handling traffic datasets, their deployment in real-life applications has been hindered by scalability constraints arising from high-order message passing. Additionally, the over-smoothing problem of GNNs may lead to indistinguishable region representations as the number of layers increases, resulting in performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose a new knowledge distillation paradigm termed LightST that transfers spatial and temporal knowledge from a high-capacity teacher to a lightweight student. Specifically, we introduce a spatio-temporal knowledge distillation framework that helps student MLPs capture graph-structured global spatio-temporal patterns while alleviating the over-smoothing effect with adaptive knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments verify that LightST significantly speeds up traffic flow predictions by 5X to 40X compared to state-of-the-art spatio-temporal GNNs, all while maintaining superior accuracy.</p></details> | 9 pages |

We provide theoretical arguments for the different temporal blocks and use a multitude of tests across different datasets to assess our hypotheses.</p></details> |  |

ANN-to-SNN knowledge distillation can improve SNN performance, but previous methods either focus solely on label information, missing valuable intermediate layer features, or use a layer-wise approach that neglects spatial and temporal semantic inconsistencies, leading to performance degradation.To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called self-attentive spatio-temporal calibration (SASTC). SASTC uses self-attention to identify semantically aligned layer pairs between ANN and SNN, both spatially and temporally. This enables the autonomous transfer of relevant semantic information. Extensive experiments show that SASTC outperforms existing methods, effectively solving the mismatching problem. Superior accuracy results include 95.12% on CIFAR-10, 79.40% on CIFAR-100 with 2 time steps, and 68.69% on ImageNet with 4 time steps for static datasets, and 97.92% on DVS-Gesture and 83.60% on DVS-CIFAR10 for neuromorphic datasets. This marks the first time SNNs have outperformed ANNs on both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, shedding the new light on the potential applications of SNNs.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches typically utilize external information such as semantic maps to improve video prediction accuracy, which often neglect the inherent physical knowledge embedded within videos. Worse still, their high computational costs could impede their applications for high-resolution videos. To address these constraints, we introduce a novel framework called \underline{P}hysics-\underline{a}ssisted \underline{S}patio-\underline{t}emporal \underline{Net}work (PastNet) for high-quality video prediction. The core of PastNet lies in incorporating a spectral convolution operator in the Fourier domain, which efficiently introduces inductive biases from the underlying physical laws. Additionally, we employ a memory bank with the estimated intrinsic dimensionality to discretize local features during the processing of complex spatio-temporal signals, thereby reducing computational costs and facilitating efficient high-resolution video prediction. Extensive experiments on various widely-used spatio-temporal video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed PastNet compared with a range of state-of-the-art methods, particularly in high-resolution scenarios.</p></details> | 11 |

However, existing approaches that separate anomaly preprocessing from model training for multivariate time series prediction encounter significant limitations. Specifically, these methods fail to utilize auxiliary information crucial for identifying latent anomalies associated with spatiotemporal factors during the preprocessing stage. Instead, they rely solely on data distribution for anomaly detection, which can result in the incorrect processing of numerous samples that could otherwise contribute positively to model training. To address this, we propose STTS-EAD, an end-to-end method that seamlessly integrates anomaly detection into the training process of multivariate time series forecasting and aims to improve Spatio-Temporal learning based Time Series prediction via Embedded Anomaly Detection. Our proposed STTS-EAD leverages spatio-temporal information for forecasting and anomaly detection, with the two parts alternately executed and optimized for each other. To the best of our knowledge, STTS-EAD is the first to integrate anomaly detection and forecasting tasks in the training phase for improving the accuracy of multivariate time series forecasting. Extensive experiments on a public stock dataset and two real-world sales datasets from a renowned coffee chain enterprise show that our proposed method can effectively process detected anomalies in the training stage to improve forecasting performance in the inference stage and significantly outperform baselines.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Small perturbations in conditions can often lead to significant changes in fire spread (such as speed and direction), necessitating a computationally expensive large set of simulations to quantify uncertainty. Model emulation seeks alternative representations of physical models using machine learning, aiming to provide more efficient and/or simplified surrogate models. We propose a dedicated spatio-temporal neural network based framework for model emulation, able to capture the complex behaviour of fire spread models. The proposed approach can approximate forecasts at fine spatial and temporal resolutions that are often challenging for neural network based approaches. Furthermore, the proposed approach is robust even with small training sets, due to novel data augmentation methods. Empirical experiments show good agreement between simulated and emulated firefronts, with an average Jaccard score of 0.76.</p></details> |  |
| **[KITS: Inductive Spatio-Temporal Kriging with Increment Training Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02565v2)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sensors are commonly deployed to perceive the environment. However, due to the high cost, sensors are usually sparsely deployed. Kriging is the tailored task to infer the unobserved nodes (without sensors) using the observed source nodes (with sensors). The essence of kriging task is transferability. Recently, several inductive spatio-temporal kriging methods have been proposed based on graph neural networks, being trained based on a graph built on top of observed nodes via pretext tasks such as masking nodes out and reconstructing them. However, the graph in training is inevitably much sparser than the graph in inference that includes all the observed and unobserved nodes. The learned pattern cannot be well generalized for inference, denoted as graph gap. To address this issue, we first present a novel Increment training strategy: instead of masking nodes (and reconstructing them), we add virtual nodes into the training graph so as to mitigate the graph gap issue naturally. Nevertheless, the empty-shell virtual nodes without labels could have bad-learned features and lack supervision signals. To solve these issues, we pair each virtual node with its most similar observed node and fuse their features together; to enhance the supervision signal, we construct reliable pseudo labels for virtual nodes. As a result, the learned pattern of virtual nodes could be safely transferred to real unobserved nodes for reliable kriging. We name our new Kriging model with Increment Training Strategy as KITS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KITS consistently outperforms existing kriging methods by large margins, e.g., the improvement over MAE score could be as high as 18.33%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by AAAI'25</p></details> |
| **[AutoSTF: Decoupled Neural Architecture Search for Cost-Effective Automated Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16586v2)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is a critical component of various smart city applications, such as transportation optimization, energy management, and socio-economic analysis. Recently, several automated spatio-temporal forecasting methods have been proposed to automatically search the optimal neural network architecture for capturing complex spatio-temporal dependencies. However, the existing automated approaches suffer from expensive neural architecture search overhead, which hinders their practical use and the further exploration of diverse spatio-temporal operators in a finer granularity. In this paper, we propose AutoSTF, a decoupled automatic neural architecture search framework for cost-effective automated spatio-temporal forecasting. From the efficiency perspective, we first decouple the mixed search space into temporal space and spatial space and respectively devise representation compression and parameter-sharing schemes to mitigate the parameter explosion. The decoupled spatio-temporal search not only expedites the model optimization process but also leaves new room for more effective spatio-temporal dependency modeling. From the effectiveness perspective, we propose a multi-patch transfer module to jointly capture multi-granularity temporal dependencies and extend the spatial search space to enable finer-grained layer-wise spatial dependency search. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the superiority of AutoSTF in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, our proposed method achieves up to 13.48x speed-up compared to state-of-the-art automatic spatio-temporal forecasting methods while maintaining the best forecasting accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2025 Research Track</p></details> |

However, due to the high heterogeneity in structure and semantics among various spatio-temporal modalities, the joint interpretation of multimodal spatio-temporal data has long been an extremely challenging problem. The primary challenge resides in striking a trade-off between the cohesion and autonomy of diverse modalities. This trade-off becomes progressively nonlinear as the number of modalities expands. Inspired by the human cognitive system and linguistic philosophy, where perceptual signals from the five senses converge into language, we introduce the Language as Reference Framework (LaRF), a fundamental principle for constructing a multimodal unified model. Building upon this, we propose AllSpark, a multimodal spatio-temporal general artificial intelligence model. Our model integrates ten different modalities into a unified framework. To achieve modal cohesion, AllSpark introduces a modal bridge and multimodal large language model (LLM) to map diverse modal features into the language feature space. To maintain modality autonomy, AllSpark uses modality-specific encoders to extract the tokens of various spatio-temporal modalities. Finally, observing a gap between the model's interpretability and downstream tasks, we designed modality-specific prompts and task heads, enhancing the model's generalization capability across specific tasks. Experiments indicate that the incorporation of language enables AllSpark to excel in few-shot classification tasks for RGB and point cloud modalities without additional training, surpassing baseline performance by up to 41.82\%.

However, traditional prediction methods are often limited by static spatial modeling, making it difficult to accurately capture the dynamic and complex relationships between time and space, thereby affecting prediction accuracy. This paper proposes an innovative traffic flow prediction network, SFADNet, which categorizes traffic flow into multiple traffic patterns based on temporal and spatial feature matrices. For each pattern, we construct an independent adaptive spatio-temporal fusion graph based on a cross-attention mechanism, employing residual graph convolution modules and time series modules to better capture dynamic spatio-temporal relationships under different fine-grained traffic patterns. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SFADNet outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines across four large-scale datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 lEEE International Conference on Acoustics, speech, and signal Processing (lCASSP2025)</p></details> |
| **[STContext: A Multifaceted Dataset for Developing Context-aware Spatio-temporal Crowd Mobility Prediction Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03583v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In smart cities, context-aware spatio-temporal crowd flow prediction (STCFP) models leverage contextual features (e.g., weather) to identify unusual crowd mobility patterns and enhance prediction accuracy. However, the best practice for incorporating contextual features remains unclear due to inconsistent usage of contextual features in different papers. Developing a multifaceted dataset with rich types of contextual features and STCFP scenarios is crucial for establishing a principled context modeling paradigm. Existing open crowd flow datasets lack an adequate range of contextual features, which poses an urgent requirement to build a multifaceted dataset to fill these research gaps. To this end, we create STContext, a multifaceted dataset for developing context-aware STCFP models. Specifically, STContext provides nine spatio-temporal datasets across five STCFP scenarios and includes ten contextual features, including weather, air quality index, holidays, points of interest, road networks, etc. Besides, we propose a unified workflow for incorporating contextual features into deep STCFP methods, with steps including feature transformation, dependency modeling, representation fusion, and training strategies. Through extensive experiments, we have obtained several useful guidelines for effective context modeling and insights for future research.

Most approaches explore spatio-temporal information of multi-scan to identify the semantic classes and motion states for each point. However, these methods often overlook the segmentation consistency in space and time, which may result in point clouds within the same object being predicted as different categories. To handle this issue, our core idea is to generate cluster labels across multiple frames that can reflect the complete spatial structure and temporal information of objects. These labels serve as explicit guidance for our dual-branch network, 4D-CS, which integrates point-based and cluster-based branches to enable more consistent segmentation. Specifically, in the point-based branch, we leverage historical knowledge to enrich the current feature through temporal fusion on multiple views. In the cluster-based branch, we propose a new strategy to produce cluster labels of foreground objects and apply them to gather point-wise information to derive cluster features. We then merge neighboring clusters across multiple scans to restore missing features due to occlusion. Finally, in the point-cluster fusion stage, we adaptively fuse the information from the two branches to optimize segmentation results. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, and we achieve state-of-the-art results on the multi-scan semantic and moving object segmentation on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets.

However, the high costs of building sensor networks limit their scale and coverage, making fine-grained deployment challenging. Inductive Spatio-Temporal Kriging (ISK) addresses this issue by introducing virtual sensors. Based on graph neural networks (GNNs) extracting the relationships between physical and virtual sensors, ISK can infer the measurements of virtual sensors from physical sensors. However, current ISK methods rely on conventional message-passing mechanisms and network architectures, without effectively extracting spatio-temporal features of physical sensors and focusing on representing virtual sensors. Additionally, existing graph construction methods face issues of sparse and noisy connections, destroying ISK performance. To address these issues, we propose DarkFarseer, a novel ISK framework with three key components. First, we propose the Neighbor Hidden Style Enhancement module with a style transfer strategy to enhance the representation of virtual nodes in a temporal-then-spatial manner to better extract the spatial relationships between physical and virtual nodes. Second, we propose Virtual-Component Contrastive Learning, which aims to enrich the node representation by establishing the association between the patterns of virtual nodes and the regional patterns within graph components. Lastly, we design a Similarity-Based Graph Denoising Strategy, which reduces the connectivity strength of noisy connections around virtual nodes and their neighbors based on their temporal information and regional spatial patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DarkFarseer significantly outperforms existing ISK methods.</p></details> | TKDE (Under Review) |

However, these models often struggle with balancing computational efficiency and model flexibility. To address this challenge, this study develops a fast and flexible method for STVC modeling. For enhanced flexibility in modeling, we assume multiple processes in each varying coefficient, including purely spatial, purely temporal, and spatio-temporal interaction processes with or without time cyclicity. While considering multiple processes can be time consuming, we combine a pre-conditioning method with a model selection procedure, inspired by reluctant interaction modeling. This approach allows us to computationally efficiently select and specify the latent space-time structure. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms alternatives in terms of coefficient estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. Finally, we apply the proposed method to crime analysis using a sample size of 279,360, confirming that the proposed method provides reasonable estimates of varying coefficients. The STVC model is implemented in an R package spmoran.</p></details> |  |

In light of this, we propose a deep spatio-temporal hypergraph convolutional neural network for soft sensing (ST-HCSS). In particular, our proposed framework is able to construct and leverage a higher-order graph (hypergraph) to model the complex multi-interactions between sensor nodes in the absence of prior structural knowledge. To capture rich spatio-temporal relationships underlying sensor data, our proposed ST-HCSS incorporates stacked gated temporal and hypergraph convolution layers to effectively aggregate and update hypergraph information across time and nodes. Our results validate the superiority of ST-HCSS compared to existing state-of-the-art soft sensors, and demonstrates that the learned hypergraph feature representations aligns well with the sensor data correlations.

This is achieved by learning low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional and raw trajectory data. However, existing methods for trajectory representation learning either rely on grid-based or road-based representations, which are inherently different and thus, could lose information contained in the other modality. Moreover, these methods overlook the dynamic nature of urban traffic, relying on static road network features rather than time varying traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose TIGR, a novel model designed to integrate grid and road network modalities while incorporating spatio-temporal dynamics to learn rich, general-purpose representations of trajectories. We evaluate TIGR on two realworld datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of combining both modalities by substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods, i.e., up to 43.22% for trajectory similarity, up to 16.65% for travel time estimation, and up to 10.16% for destination prediction.</p></details> |  |

Existing dynamic reconstruction methods often rely on per-scene optimization, dense observations across space and time, and strong motion supervision, resulting in lengthy optimization times, limited generalization to novel views or scenes, and degenerated quality caused by noisy pseudo-labels for dynamics. To address these challenges, STORM leverages a data-driven Transformer architecture that directly infers dynamic 3D scene representations--parameterized by 3D Gaussians and their velocities--in a single forward pass. Our key design is to aggregate 3D Gaussians from all frames using self-supervised scene flows, transforming them to the target timestep to enable complete (i.e., "amodal") reconstructions from arbitrary viewpoints at any moment in time. As an emergent property, STORM automatically captures dynamic instances and generates high-quality masks using only reconstruction losses. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that STORM achieves precise dynamic scene reconstruction, surpassing state-of-the-art per-scene optimization methods (+4.3 to 6.6 PSNR) and existing feed-forward approaches (+2.1 to 4.7 PSNR) in dynamic regions. STORM reconstructs large-scale outdoor scenes in 200ms, supports real-time rendering, and outperforms competitors in scene flow estimation, improving 3D EPE by 0.422m and Acc5 by 28.02%. Beyond reconstruction, we showcase four additional applications of our model, illustrating the potential of self-supervised learning for broader dynamic scene understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at: https://jiawei-yang.github.io/STORM/</p></details> |

To solve this problem, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Aggregation eorganization ransformer (STARFormer) that effectively captures both spatial and temporal features of BOLD signals by incorporating three key modules. The region of interest (ROI) spatial structure analysis module uses eigenvector centrality (EC) to reorganize brain regions based on effective connectivity, highlighting critical spatial relationships relevant to the brain disorder. The temporal feature reorganization module systematically segments the time series into equal-dimensional window tokens and captures multiscale features through variable window and cross-window attention. The spatio-temporal feature fusion module employs a parallel transformer architecture with dedicated temporal and spatial branches to extract integrated features. The proposed STARFormer has been rigorously evaluated on two publicly available datasets for the classification of ASD and ADHD. The experimental results confirm that the STARFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, providing a more accurate and reliable tool for the diagnosis of brain disorders and biomedical research. The codes will be available at: https://github.com/NZWANG/STARFormer.</p></details> |  |

Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have garnered widespread attention in this field for their proficiency in capturing relationships among joints in human motion. However, existing GCN-based methods tend to focus on either temporal-domain or spatial-domain features, or they combine spatio-temporal features without fully leveraging the complementarity and cross-dependency of these two features. In this paper, we propose the Spatial-Temporal Multi-Subgraph Graph Convolutional Network (STMS-GCN) to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies in human motion. Specifically, we decouple the modeling of temporal and spatial dependencies, enabling cross-domain knowledge transfer at multiple scales through a spatio-temporal information consistency constraint mechanism. Besides, we utilize multiple subgraphs to extract richer motion information and enhance the learning associations of diverse subgraphs through a homogeneous information constraint mechanism. Extensive experiments on the standard HMP benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p></details> |  |

We leverage an explicit link between stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) and GPs on graphs, introduce a framework for deriving graph kernels via SPDEs, and derive non-separable spatio-temporal graph kernels that capture interaction across space and time. We formulate the graph kernels for the stochastic heat equation and wave equation. We show that by providing novel tools for spatio-temporal GP modelling on graphs, we outperform pre-existing graph kernels in real-world applications that feature diffusion, oscillation, and other complicated interactions.</p></details> |  |

By analyzing data over a 30-day period with comparable climate and average temperatures, we explored differences in BSS usage between weekdays and weekends in those cities using Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) and rank distribution analysis. Our findings reveal significant temporal differences in BSS usage that were commonly observed in all cities, with weekday patterns dominated by commute peaks and weekend patterns reflecting recreational activities. Friday emerges as a transitional day, sharing the characteristics of both weekdays and weekends. Meanwhile, docking station usage rank distributions show remarkable consistency between weekdays and weekends for most cities, with London being a unique anomaly. This study highlights the potential of BSS data to uncover urban mobility patterns and the underlying structures of cities. The results suggest that BSS usage reflects both intrinsic user behavior and external influences such as urban planning.</p></details> | 16pages, 5figures |

However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, Submitted to TMM in 30-May-2024</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Electromagnetic Kernel Learning for Channel Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17414v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate channel prediction is essential for addressing channel aging caused by user mobility. However, the actual channel variations over time are highly complex in high-mobility scenarios, which makes it difficult for existing predictors to obtain future channels accurately. The low accuracy of channel predictors leads to difficulties in supporting reliable communication. To overcome this challenge, we propose a channel predictor based on spatio-temporal electromagnetic (EM) kernel learning (STEM-KL). Specifically, inspired by recent advancements in EM information theory (EIT), the STEM kernel function is derived. The velocity and the concentration kernel parameters are designed to reflect the time-varying propagation of the wireless signal. We obtain the parameters through kernel learning. Then, the future channels are predicted by computing their Bayesian posterior, with the STEM kernel acting as the prior. To further improve the stability and model expressibility, we propose a grid-based EM mixed kernel learning (GEM-KL) scheme. We design the mixed kernel to be a convex combination of multiple sub-kernels, where each of the sub-kernel corresponds to a grid point in the set of pre-selected parameters. This approach transforms non-convex STEM kernel learning problem into a convex grid-based problem that can be easily solved by weight optimization. Finally, simulation results verify that the proposed STEM-KL and GEM-KL schemes can achieve more accurate channel prediction. This indicates that EIT can improve the performance of wireless system efficiently.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper proposes an EIT-inspired Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based channel predictor with improved performance.

| **[Deep Learning for Spatio-Temporal Fusion in Land Surface Temperature Estimation: A Comprehensive Survey, Experimental Analysis, and Future Trends](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16631v1)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in satellite remote sensing have enhanced the capability to monitor and analyze the Earth's surface. Among the many variables captured through satellite sensors, Land Surface Temperature (LST) plays a critical role in understanding key environmental processes. However, obtaining high-resolution LST data remains a challenge, as satellite sensors often face a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions. In response, Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) has emerged as a powerful method to integrate two satellite data sources, one providing high spatial but low temporal resolution, and the other offering high temporal but low spatial resolution. Although a range of STF techniques have been proposed, from traditional methods to cutting-edge deep learning (DL) models, most have focused on surface reflectance, with limited application to LST estimation. DL approaches, in particular, show promise in improving the spatial and temporal resolutions of LST by capturing complex, non-linear relationships between input and output LST data. This paper offers a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in DL-based STF techniques for LST estimation. We analyze key research developments, mathematically formulate the STF problem, and introduce a novel taxonomy for DL-based STF methods. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges faced by current methods and highlight future research directions. In addition, we present the first open-source benchmark STF dataset for LST estimation, consisting of 51 pairs of MODIS-Landsat images spanning from 2013 to 2024. To support our findings, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art methods and present both quantitative and qualitative assessments. This is the first survey paper focused on DL-based STF for LST estimation. We hope it serves as a valuable reference for researchers and paves the way for future research in this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Proceedings of IEEE</p></details> |
| **[Clustering Time-Evolving Networks Using the Spatio-Temporal Graph Laplacian](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12864v3)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-evolving graphs arise frequently when modeling complex dynamical systems such as social networks, traffic flow, and biological processes. Developing techniques to identify and analyze communities in these time-varying graph structures is an important challenge. In this work, we generalize existing spectral clustering algorithms from static to dynamic graphs using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to capture the temporal evolution of clusters. Based on this extended canonical correlation framework, we define the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian and investigate its spectral properties. We connect these concepts to dynamical systems theory via transfer operators, and illustrate the advantages of our method on benchmark graphs by comparison with existing methods. We show that the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian allows for a clear interpretation of cluster structure evolution over time for directed and undirected graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Dynamic Edge Service Placement Under Spatio-Temporal Correlated Demand Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15608v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Edge computing allows Service Providers (SPs) to enhance user experience by placing their services closer to the network edge. Determining the optimal provisioning of edge resources to meet the varying and uncertain demand cost-effectively is a critical task for SPs. This paper introduces a novel two-stage multi-period robust model for edge service placement and workload allocation, aiming to minimize the SP's operating costs while ensuring service quality. The salient feature of this model lies in its ability to enable SPs to utilize dynamic service placement and leverage spatio-temporal correlation in demand uncertainties to mitigate the inherent conservatism of robust solutions. In our model, resource reservation is optimized in the initial stage, preemptively, before the actual demand is disclosed, whereas dynamic service placement and workload allocation are determined in the subsequent stage, following the revelation of uncertainties. To address the challenges posed by integer recourse variables in the second stage of the resulting tri-level adjustable robust optimization problem, we propose a novel iterative, decomposition-based approach, ensuring finite convergence to an exact optimal solution. Extensive numerical results are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model and approach.</p></details> | 15 pages |

Yet, causal inference with these data remains challenging due to the twin threats of spatial spillover and temporal carryover effects. We develop methods to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects by allowing for arbitrary spatial and temporal causal dependencies. We focus on common settings where the treatment and outcomes are time-varying spatial point patterns and where moderators are either spatial or spatio-temporal in nature. We define causal estimands based on stochastic interventions where researchers specify counterfactual distributions of treatment events. We propose the Hajek-type estimator of the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) as a function of spatio-temporal moderator variables, and establish its asymptotic normality as the number of time periods increases. We then introduce a statistical test of no heterogeneous treatment effects. Through simulations, we evaluate the finite-sample performance of the proposed CATE estimator and its inferential properties. Our motivating application examines the heterogeneous effects of US airstrikes on insurgent violence in Iraq. Drawing on declassified spatio-temporal data, we examine how prior aid distributions moderate airstrike effects. Contrary to expectations from counterinsurgency theories, we find that prior aid distribution, along with greater amounts of aid per capita, is associated with increased insurgent attacks following airstrikes.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we propose a novel fall detection system using FLAMe (Federated Learning with Attention Mechanism), a federated learning (FL) based algorithm. FLAMe trains around important keypoint information and only transmits the trained important weights to the server, reducing communication costs and preserving data privacy. Furthermore, the lightweight keypoint transformer model is integrated into the FL framework to effectively learn spatio-temporal features. We validated the experiment using 22,672 video samples from the "Fall Accident Risk Behavior Video-Sensor Pair data" dataset from AI-Hub. As a result of the experiment, the FLAMe-based system achieved an accuracy of 94.02% with about 190,000 transmission parameters, maintaining performance similar to that of existing centralized learning while maximizing efficiency by reducing communication costs by about 40% compared to the existing FL algorithm, FedAvg. Therefore, the FLAMe algorithm has demonstrated that it provides robust performance in the distributed environment of smart cities and is a practical and effective solution for public safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, AAAI 2025 FLUID Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Global Spatio-Temporal Fusion-based Traffic Prediction Algorithm with Anomaly Aware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14569v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic prediction is an indispensable component of urban planning and traffic management. Achieving accurate traffic prediction hinges on the ability to capture the potential spatio-temporal relationships among road sensors. However, the majority of existing works focus on local short-term spatio-temporal correlations, failing to fully consider the interactions of different sensors in the long-term state. In addition, these works do not analyze the influences of anomalous factors, or have insufficient ability to extract personalized features of anomalous factors, which make them ineffectively capture their spatio-temporal influences on traffic prediction. To address the aforementioned issues, We propose a global spatio-temporal fusion-based traffic prediction algorithm that incorporates anomaly awareness. Initially, based on the designed anomaly detection network, we construct an efficient anomalous factors impacting module (AFIM), to evaluate the spatio-temporal impact of unexpected external events on traffic prediction. Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale spatio-temporal feature fusion module (MTSFFL) based on the transformer architecture, to obtain all possible both long and short term correlations among different sensors in a wide-area traffic environment for accurate prediction of traffic flow. Finally, experiments are implemented based on real-scenario public transportation datasets (PEMS04 and PEMS08) to demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of PM2.5 via Spatial-Diffusion guided Encoder-Decoder Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13935v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many problem settings that require spatio-temporal forecasting, the values in the time-series not only exhibit spatio-temporal correlations but are also influenced by spatial diffusion across locations. One such example is forecasting the concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the atmosphere which is influenced by many complex factors, the most important ones being diffusion due to meteorological factors as well as transport across vast distances over a period of time. We present a novel Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network architecture, that specifically captures these dependencies to forecast the PM2.5 concentration. Our model is based on an encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder and decoder parts leverage gated recurrent units (GRU) augmented with a graph neural network (TransformerConv) to account for spatial diffusion. Our model can also be seen as a generalization of various existing models for time-series or spatio-temporal forecasting. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness on two real-world PM2.5 datasets: (1) data collected by us using a recently deployed network of low-cost PM$_{2.5}$ sensors from 511 locations spanning the entirety of the Indian state of Bihar over a period of one year, and (2) another publicly available dataset that covers severely polluted regions from China for a period of 4 years. Our experimental results show our model's impressive ability to account for both spatial as well as temporal dependencies precisely.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, International Conference on Data Science and Management of Data (CODS-COMAD), IIT Jodhpur, 2024</p></details> |
| **[Geolocation Representation from Large Language Models are Generic Enhancers for Spatio-Temporal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12116v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the geospatial domain, universal representation models are significantly less prevalent than their extensive use in natural language processing and computer vision. This discrepancy arises primarily from the high costs associated with the input of existing representation models, which often require street views and mobility data. To address this, we develop a novel, training-free method that leverages large language models (LLMs) and auxiliary map data from OpenStreetMap to derive geolocation representations (LLMGeovec). LLMGeovec can represent the geographic semantics of city, country, and global scales, which acts as a generic enhancer for spatio-temporal learning. Specifically, by direct feature concatenation, we introduce a simple yet effective paradigm for enhancing multiple spatio-temporal tasks including geographic prediction (GP), long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), and graph-based spatio-temporal forecasting (GSTF). LLMGeovec can seamlessly integrate into a wide spectrum of spatio-temporal learning models, providing immediate enhancements. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMGeovec achieves global coverage and significantly boosts the performance of leading GP, LTSF, and GSTF models.

| **[2D-AoI: Age-of-Information of Distributed Sensors for Spatio-Temporal Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12789v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The freshness of sensor data is critical for all types of cyber-physical systems. An established measure for quantifying data freshness is the Age-of-Information (AoI), which has been the subject of extensive research. Recently, there has been increased interest in multi-sensor systems: redundant sensors producing samples of the same physical process, sensors such as cameras producing overlapping views, or distributed sensors producing correlated samples. When the information from a particular sensor is outdated, fresh samples from other correlated sensors can be helpful. To quantify the utility of distant but correlated samples, we put forth a two-dimensional (2D) model of AoI that takes into account the sensor distance in an age-equivalent representation. Since we define 2D-AoI as equivalent to AoI, it can be readily linked to existing AoI research, especially on parallel systems. We consider physical phenomena modeled as spatio-temporal processes and derive the 2D-AoI for different Gaussian correlation kernels. For a basic exponential product kernel, we find that spatial distance causes an additive offset of the AoI, while for other kernels the effects of spatial distance are more complex and vary with time. Using our methodology, we evaluate the 2D-AoI of different spatial topologies and sensor densities.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the development of TextVQA in image domain, existing Video TextVQA approaches leverage a language model (e.g. T5) to process text-rich multiple frames and generate answers auto-regressively. Nevertheless, the spatio-temporal relationships among visual entities (including scene text and objects) will be disrupted and models are susceptible to interference from unrelated information, resulting in irrational reasoning and inaccurate answering. To tackle these challenges, we propose the TEA (stands for ``\textbf{T}rack th\textbf{E} \textbf{A}nswer'') method that better extends the generative TextVQA framework from image to video. TEA recovers the spatio-temporal relationships in a complementary way and incorporates OCR-aware clues to enhance the quality of reasoning questions. Extensive experiments on several public Video TextVQA datasets validate the effectiveness and generalization of our framework. TEA outperforms existing TextVQA methods, video-language pretraining methods and video large language models by great margins.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Bayesian Levy-Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Process: Towards Big Data Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08451v2)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this era of big data, all scientific disciplines are evolving fast to cope up with the enormity of the available information. So is statistics, the queen of science. Big data are particularly relevant to spatio-temporal statistics, thanks to much-improved technology in satellite based remote sensing and Geographical Information Systems. However, none of the existing approaches seem to meet the simultaneous demand of reality emulation and cheap computation. In this article, with the Levy random fields as the starting point, e construct a new Bayesian nonparametric, nonstationary and nonseparable dynamic spatio-temporal model with the additional realistic property that the lagged spatio-temporal correlations converge to zero as the lag tends to infinity. Although our Bayesian model seems to be intricately structured and is variable-dimensional with respect to each time index, we are able to devise a fast and efficient parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for Bayesian inference. Our simulation experiment brings out quite encouraging performance from our Bayesian Levy-dynamic approach. We finally apply our Bayesian Levy-dynamic model and methods to a sea surface temperature dataset consisting of 139,300 data points in space and time. Although not big data in the true sense, this is a large and highly structured data by any standard. Even for this large and complex data, our parallel MCMC algorithm, implemented on 80 processors, generated 110,000 MCMC realizations from the Levy-dynamic posterior within a single day, and the resultant Bayesian posterior predictive analysis turned out to be encouraging. Thus, it is not unreasonable to expect that with significantly more computing resources, it is feasible to analyse terabytes of spatio-temporal data with our new model and methods.</p></details> | An updated version |

However, the complex and dynamic nature of these correlations presents significant modeling challenges. To address this, we propose a spatio-temporal dynamic hypergraph learning (STDHL) model. This model uses a hypergraph structure to represent spatial features among wind farms. Unlike traditional graph structures, which only capture pair-wise node features, hypergraphs create hyperedges connecting multiple nodes, enabling the representation and transmission of higher-order spatial features. The STDHL model incorporates a novel dynamic hypergraph convolutional layer to model dynamic spatial correlations and a grouped temporal convolutional layer for channel-independent temporal modeling. The model uses spatio-temporal encoders to extract features from multi-source covariates, which are mapped to quantile results through a forecast decoder. Experimental results using the GEFCom dataset show that the STDHL model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis highlights the critical role of spatio-temporal covariates in improving ultra-short-term forecasting accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, existing transformer-based methods primarily use self-attention mechanisms for spatio-temporal modeling, leading to a quadratic complexity, unidirectional modeling of spatio-temporal relationships, and insufficient learning of spatial-temporal correlations. Recently, the Mamba architecture, utilizing the state space model (SSM), has exhibited superior long-range modeling capabilities in a variety of vision tasks with linear complexity. In this paper, we propose PoseMamba, a novel purely SSM-based approach with linear complexity for 3D human pose estimation in monocular video. Specifically, we propose a bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block that comprehensively models human joint relations within individual frames as well as temporal correlations across frames. Within this bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block, we introduce a reordering strategy to enhance the local modeling capability of the SSM. This strategy provides a more logical geometric scanning order and integrates it with the global SSM, resulting in a combined global-local spatial scan. We have quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated our approach using two benchmark datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoseMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets while maintaining a smaller model size and reducing computational costs. The code and models will be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accpe...</summary><p>Accpeted by the 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[B-VLLM: A Vision Large Language Model with Balanced Spatio-Temporal Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09919v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) integrated with vision encoders have shown promising performance in vision understanding. The key of VLLMs is to encode visual content into sequences of visual tokens, enabling VLLMs to simultaneously process both visual and textual content. However, understanding videos, especially long videos, remain a challenge to VLLMs as the number of visual tokens grows rapidly when encoding videos, resulting in the risk of exceeding the context window of VLLMs and introducing heavy computation burden. To restrict the number of visual tokens, existing VLLMs either: (1) uniformly downsample videos into a fixed number of frames or (2) reducing the number of visual tokens encoded from each frame. We argue the former solution neglects the rich temporal cue in videos and the later overlooks the spatial details in each frame. In this work, we present Balanced-VLLM (B-VLLM): a novel VLLM framework that aims to effectively leverage task relevant spatio-temporal cues while restricting the number of visual tokens under the VLLM context window length. At the core of our method, we devise a text-conditioned adaptive frame selection module to identify frames relevant to the visual understanding task. The selected frames are then de-duplicated using a temporal frame token merging technique. The visual tokens of the selected frames are processed through a spatial token sampling module and an optional spatial token merging strategy to achieve precise control over the token count. Experimental results show that B-VLLM is effective in balancing the number of frames and visual tokens in video understanding, yielding superior performance on various video understanding benchmarks. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhuqiangLu/B-VLLM.</p></details> |  |

Schr\"odinger in 1931/32. It represents an early formulation of a maximum likelihood problem. This specific formulation can also be seen as the control problem to modify the law of a diffusion process so as to match specifications on marginal distributions at given times. Thereby, in recent years, this so-called Schr\"odinger's bridge problem has been at the center of the uncertainty control development. However, an understudied facet of this program has been to address uncertainty in space (state) and time, modeling the effect of tasks being completed contingent on meeting a certain condition at some random time instead of imposing specifications at fixed times. The present work is a study to extend Schr\"odinger's paradigm on such an issue, and herein, it is tackled in the context of random walks on directed graphs. Specifically, we study the case where one marginal is the initial probability distribution on a Markov chain, while others are marginals of stopping (first-arrival) times at absorbing states, signifying completion of tasks. We show when the prior law on paths is Markov, a Markov policy is once again optimal to satisfy those marginal constraints with respect to a likelihood cost following Schr\"odinger's dictum. Based on this, we present the mathematical formulation involving a Sinkhorn-type iteration to construct the optimal probability law on paths matching the spatio-temporal marginals.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

In particular, Saudi Arabia is gradually shifting its energy portfolio from an exclusive use of oil to a reliance on renewable energy, and, in particular, wind. Modeling wind for assessing potential energy output in a country as large, geographically diverse and understudied as Saudi Arabia is a challenge which implies highly non-linear dynamic structures in both space and time. To address this, we propose a spatio-temporal model whose spatial information is first reduced via an energy distance-based approach and then its dynamical behavior is informed by a sparse and stochastic recurrent neural network (Echo State Network). Finally, the full spatial data is reconstructed by means of a non-stationary stochastic partial differential equation-based approach. Our model can capture the fine scale wind structure and produce more accurate forecasts of both wind speed and energy in lead times of interest for energy grid management and save annually as much as one million dollar against the closest competitive model.</p></details> |  |

However, little consideration is given to how to use these models for real-time or cooperative jamming musical applications because of crucial required features: low latency, the ability to communicate planned actions, and the ability to adapt to user input in real-time. To support these needs, we introduce ReaLJam, an interface and protocol for live musical jamming sessions between a human and a Transformer-based AI agent trained with reinforcement learning. We enable real-time interactions using the concept of anticipation, where the agent continually predicts how the performance will unfold and visually conveys its plan to the user. We conduct a user study where experienced musicians jam in real-time with the agent through ReaLJam. Our results demonstrate that ReaLJam enables enjoyable and musically interesting sessions, and we uncover important takeaways for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Extended Abstracts of the CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI EA '25), April 26-May 1, 2025, Yokohama, Japan</p></details> |

Beyond forecasting, considerable real-world tasks are categorized into classification, imputation, and anomaly detection, underscoring different capabilities termed time series understanding in this paper. While GPT-style models have been positioned as foundation models for time series forecasting, the BERT-style architecture, which has made significant advances in natural language understanding, has not been fully unlocked for time series understanding, possibly attributed to the undesirable dropout of essential elements of BERT. In this paper, inspired by the shared multi-granularity structure between multivariate time series and multisentence documents, we design TimesBERT to learn generic representations of time series including temporal patterns and variate-centric characteristics. In addition to a natural adaptation of masked modeling, we propose a parallel task of functional token prediction to embody vital multi-granularity structures. Our model is pre-trained on 260 billion time points across diverse domains. Leveraging multi-granularity representations, TimesBERT achieves state-of-the-art performance across four typical downstream understanding tasks, outperforming task-specific models and language pre-trained backbones, positioning it as a versatile foundation model for time series understanding.</p></details> |  |

Our solution relies on a low-dimensional embedding of the character's mesh, based on rigged key vertices that are automatically transferred from the source to the target. Motion descriptors are extracted from the trajectories of these key vertices, providing an embedding that contains combined semantic information about both shape and pose. A novel, adaptive algorithm is then used to automatically select and weight the most relevant features over time, enabling us to efficiently optimize the target motion until it conforms to these constraints, so as to preserve the semantics of the source motion. Our solution allows extensions to several novel use-cases where morphology and mesh contacts were previously overlooked, such as multi-character retargeting and motion transfer on uneven terrains. As our results show, our method is able to achieve real-time retargeting onto a wide variety of characters. Extensive experiments and comparison with state-of-the-art methods using several relevant metrics demonstrate improved results, both in terms of motion smoothness and contact accuracy.</p></details> |  |

We let the devices adjust the transmission probabilities based on their current battery level. Using a Markovian analysis, we derive analytically the average AoI. We further provide an approximate analysis for accurate and easy-to-compute approximations of both the average AoI and the age-violation probability (AVP), i.e., the probability that the AoI exceeds a given threshold. We also analyze the average throughput. Via numerical results, we investigate two baseline strategies: transmit a new update whenever possible to exploit every opportunity to reduce the AoI, and transmit only when sufficient energy is available to increase the chance of successful decoding. The two strategies are beneficial for low and high update-generation rates, respectively. We show that an optimized policy that balances the two strategies outperforms them significantly in terms of both AoI metrics and throughput.

However, this practice exposes TTA to adversarial risks. Existing studies have shown that when TTA is updated with crafted adversarial test samples, also known as test-time poisoned data, the performance on benign samples can deteriorate. Nonetheless, the perceived adversarial risk may be overstated if the poisoned data is generated under overly strong assumptions. In this work, we first review realistic assumptions for test-time data poisoning, including white-box versus grey-box attacks, access to benign data, attack order, and more. We then propose an effective and realistic attack method that better produces poisoned samples without access to benign samples, and derive an effective in-distribution attack objective. We also design two TTA-aware attack objectives. Our benchmarks of existing attack methods reveal that the TTA methods are more robust than previously believed. In addition, we analyze effective defense strategies to help develop adversarially robust TTA methods.

An efficient solver is proposed for the systems arising after discretization in time based on a fixed-point iteration. Every step of this iteration amounts to the solution of a discretized time-periodic and time-invariant problem for which efficient parallel-in-time methods are available. Global convergence with contraction factors independent of the discretization parameters is established. Together with an appropriate initialization step, a highly efficient and reliable solver is obtained. The applicability and performance of the proposed method is illustrated by simulations of a power transformer.

| **[Forecasting Monthly Residential Natural Gas Demand Using Just-In-Time-Learning Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20989v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural gas (NG) is relatively a clean source of energy, particularly compared to fossil fuels, and worldwide consumption of NG has been increasing almost linearly in the last two decades. A similar trend can also be seen in Turkey, while another similarity is the high dependence on imports for the continuous NG supply. It is crucial to accurately forecast future NG demand (NGD) in Turkey, especially, for import contracts; in this respect, forecasts of monthly NGD for the following year are of utmost importance. In the current study, the historical monthly NG consumption data between 2014 and 2024 provided by SOCAR, the local residential NG distribution company for two cities in Turkey, Bursa and Kayseri, was used to determine out-of-sample monthly NGD forecasts for a period of one year and nine months using various time series models, including SARIMA and ETS models, and a novel proposed machine learning method. The proposed method, named Just-in-Time-Learning-Gaussian Process Regression (JITL-GPR), uses a novel feature representation for the past NG demand values; instead of using past demand values as column-wise separate features, they are placed on a two-dimensional (2-D) grid of year-month values. For each test point, a kernel function, tailored for the NGD predictions, is used in GPR to predict the query point. Since a model is constructed separately for each test point, the proposed method is, indeed, an example of JITL. The JITL-GPR method is easy to use and optimize, and offers a reduction in forecast errors compared to traditional time series methods and a state-of-the-art combination model; therefore, it is a promising tool for NGD forecasting in similar settings.</p></details> |  |

To mitigate these severe impacts, early fire detection and warning systems are crucial. Current systems rely primarily on fixed CCTV cameras with a limited field of view, restricting their effectiveness in large outdoor environments. The fusion of intelligent fire detection with remote sensing improves coverage and mobility, enabling monitoring in remote and challenging areas. Existing approaches predominantly utilize convolutional neural networks and vision transformer models. While these architectures provide high accuracy in fire detection, their computational complexity limits real-time performance on edge devices such as UAVs. In our work, we present a lightweight fire detection model based on MobileViT-S, compressed through the distillation of knowledge from a stronger teacher model. The ablation study highlights the impact of a teacher model and the chosen distillation technique on the model's performance improvement. We generate activation map visualizations using Grad-CAM to confirm the model's ability to focus on relevant fire regions. The high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed model make it well-suited for deployment on satellites, UAVs, and IoT devices for effective fire detection. Experiments on common fire benchmarks demonstrate that our model suppresses the state-of-the-art model by 0.44%, 2.00% while maintaining a compact model size. Our model delivers the highest processing speed among existing works, achieving real-time performance on resource-constrained devices.</p></details> |  |

These problems can be solved by engaging unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provided with embedded platforms and optical sensors. In this work, we focus on enabling onboard aerial image processing to ensure proper and real-time disaster detection. Such a setting usually causes challenges due to the limited hardware resources of UAVs. However, privacy, connectivity, and latency issues can be avoided. We suggest a UAV-assisted edge framework for disaster detection, leveraging our proposed model optimized for onboard real-time aerial image classification. The optimization of the model is achieved using post-training quantization techniques. To address the limited number of disaster cases in existing benchmark datasets and therefore ensure real-world adoption of our model, we construct a novel dataset, DisasterEye, featuring disaster scenes captured by UAVs and individuals on-site. Experimental results reveal the efficacy of our model, reaching high accuracy with lowered inference latency and memory use on both traditional machines and resource-limited devices. This shows that the scalability and adaptability of our method make it a powerful solution for real-time disaster management on resource-constrained UAV platforms.</p></details> |  |

Revisiting the Importance of Frame Rate in Real-Time Zero-Shot Surgical Video Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20934v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time video segmentation is a promising feature for AI-assisted surgery, providing intraoperative guidance by identifying surgical tools and anatomical structures. However, deploying state-of-the-art segmentation models, such as SAM2, in real-time settings is computationally demanding, which makes it essential to balance frame rate and segmentation performance. In this study, we investigate the impact of frame rate on zero-shot surgical video segmentation, evaluating SAM2's effectiveness across multiple frame sampling rates for cholecystectomy procedures. Surprisingly, our findings indicate that in conventional evaluation settings, frame rates as low as a single frame per second can outperform 25 FPS, as fewer frames smooth out segmentation inconsistencies. However, when assessed in a real-time streaming scenario, higher frame rates yield superior temporal coherence and stability, particularly for dynamic objects such as surgical graspers. Finally, we investigate human perception of real-time surgical video segmentation among professionals who work closely with such data and find that respondents consistently prefer high FPS segmentation mask overlays, reinforcing the importance of real-time evaluation in AI-assisted surgery.</p></details> |  |

Using a weighted average of neighbor estimates exchanged over a strongly connected digraph, each observer estimates the system state despite limited local sensor measurements. The proposed design guarantees that distributed state estimation errors converge to zero at a user-specified convergence time, irrespective of observers' initial conditions. To achieve this prescribed-time convergence, distributed observers implement time-varying local output injection gains that asymptotically approach infinity as the prescribed time is approached. The theoretical convergence is rigorously proven and validated through numerical simulations.</p></details> |  |

The utility of the proposed approach is particularly evident in mobile robotics, where agents benefit from being organized and navigated in formation for a variety of real-world applications requiring frequent alterations in formation shape for efficient navigation or task completion. Given the constrained operational time inherent to battery-powered mobile robots, the time needed to complete the formation reshaping process is crucial for their efficient operation, especially in case of multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The proposed Collision-Aware Time-Optimal formation Reshaping Algorithm (CAT-ORA) builds upon the Hungarian algorithm for the solution of the robot-to-goal assignment implementing the inter-agent collision avoidance through direct constraints on mutually exclusive robot-goal pairs combined with a trajectory generation approach minimizing the duration of the reshaping process. Theoretical validations confirm the optimality of CAT-ORA, with its efficacy further showcased through simulations, and a real-world outdoor experiment involving 19 UAVs. Thorough numerical analysis shows the potential of CAT-ORA to decrease the time required to perform complex formation reshaping tasks by up to 49%, and 12% on average compared to commonly used methods in randomly generated scenarios.</p></details> | 20 pages, 12 figures |

Our key contribution is a test-time Iterative Cluster-free Re-ranking process that leverages gallery-gallery feature information to establish semantic links between query and gallery images. This enables the retrieval of relevant images even when they do not exhibit similar visual features but share underlying semantic concepts. This can be combined with any pre-existing cross-domain feature extraction backbone to improve retrieval performance. However, when combined with a carefully chosen Vision Transformer backbone and combination of zero-shot retrieval losses, our approach yields state-of-the-art results on the Sketchy, TU-Berlin and QuickDraw sketch-based retrieval benchmarks. We show that our re-ranking also improves performance with other backbones and outperforms other re-ranking methods applied with our backbone. Importantly, unlike many previous methods, none of the components in our approach are engineered specifically towards the sketch-based image retrieval task - it can be generally applied to any cross-domain, zero-shot retrieval task. We therefore also present new results on zero-shot cartoon-to-photo and art-to-product retrieval using the Office-Home dataset.

| **[Discrete-time Indirect Adaptive Control for Systems with Disturbances via Directional Forgetting: Concurrent Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09316v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, adaptive control systems with relaxed persistent excitation (PE) conditions have been proposed to guarantee true parameter convergence and improve the transient response. However, in some cases, sufficient control performance and parameter convergence cannot be easily achieved, with stability demonstrated only under ideal conditions, such as the absence of disturbances and matching conditions required. In this study, we propose a novel adaptive control method for discrete-time systems with disturbances, which is not under an ideal case, that combines directional forgetting and concurrent learning. The proposed method does not require the PE condition, information on disturbances, unknown parameters, or matching conditions, and it guarantees uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). It was also theoretically demonstrated that the ultimate bound can be designed based on the forgetting factor, which is a design parameter. In addition, the upper bound decreases with time step, which is independent of the system order and/or target trajectory due to forgetting factor. This also implies stronger stability than a normal UUB. Numerical simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | 22 pages, 9 figure |
| **[Multimodal Learning for Just-In-Time Software Defect Prediction in Autonomous Driving Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20806v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the rise of autonomous driving technologies has highlighted the critical importance of reliable software for ensuring safety and performance. This paper proposes a novel approach for just-in-time software defect prediction (JIT-SDP) in autonomous driving software systems using multimodal learning. The proposed model leverages the multimodal transformers in which the pre-trained transformers and a combining module deal with the multiple data modalities of the software system datasets such as code features, change metrics, and contextual information. The key point for adapting multimodal learning is to utilize the attention mechanism between the different data modalities such as text, numerical, and categorical. In the combining module, the output of a transformer model on text data and tabular features containing categorical and numerical data are combined to produce the predictions using the fully connected layers. Experiments conducted on three open-source autonomous driving system software projects collected from the GitHub repository (Apollo, Carla, and Donkeycar) demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and machine learning models regarding evaluation metrics. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal learning to enhance the reliability and safety of autonomous driving software through improved defect prediction.</p></details> | 9 |

It has great potential to empower the automatic professional report generation in financial analysis, research presentation, education, and healthcare. In this work, we build a vision-language model (VLM) based multi-agent framework for effective automatic chart generation. Generating high-quality charts requires both strong visual design skills and precise coding capabilities that embed the desired visual properties into code. Such a complex multi-modal reasoning process is difficult for direct prompting of VLMs. To resolve these challenges, we propose METAL, a multi-agent framework that decomposes the task of chart generation into the iterative collaboration among specialized agents. METAL achieves 5.2% improvement over the current best result in the chart generation task. The METAL framework exhibits the phenomenon of test-time scaling: its performance increases monotonically as the logarithmic computational budget grows from 512 to 8192 tokens. In addition, we find that separating different modalities during the critique process of METAL boosts the self-correction capability of VLMs in the multimodal context.</p></details> |  |

While next-token prediction based Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in long-text translation, non-extensive language models often suffer from omissions and semantic inconsistencies when processing paragraphs. Existing preference alignment methods improve sentence-level translation but fail to ensure coherence over extended contexts due to the myopic nature of next-token generation. We introduce Plan2Align, a test-time alignment framework that treats translation as a predictive planning problem, adapting Model Predictive Control to iteratively refine translation outputs. Experiments on WMT24 Discourse-Level Literary Translation show that Plan2Align significantly improves paragraph-level translation, achieving performance surpassing or on par with the existing training-time and test-time alignment methods on LLaMA-3.1 8B.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

In practice, the coding speed of NVCs depends on 1) computational costs, and 2) non-computational operational costs, such as memory I/O and the number of function calls. While most efficient NVCs prioritize reducing computational cost, we identify operational cost as the primary bottleneck to achieving higher coding speed. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a set of efficiency-driven design improvements focused on minimizing operational costs. Specifically, we employ implicit temporal modeling to eliminate complex explicit motion modules, and use single low-resolution latent representations rather than progressive downsampling. These innovations significantly accelerate NVC without sacrificing compression quality. Additionally, we implement model integerization for consistent cross-device coding and a module-bank-based rate control scheme to improve practical adaptability. Experiments show our proposed DCVC-RT achieves an impressive average encoding/decoding speed at 125.2/112.8 fps (frames per second) for 1080p video, while saving an average of 21% in bitrate compared to H.266/VTM.

We suggest the method of time series knockoffs inference (TSKI) by exploiting the ideas of subsampling and e-values to address the difficulty caused by the serial dependence. We also generalize the robust knockoffs inference in Barber, Cand\`es, and Samworth to the time series setting to relax the assumption of known covariate distribution required by model-X knockoffs, since such an assumption is overly stringent for time series data. We establish sufficient conditions under which TSKI achieves the asymptotic false discovery rate (FDR) control. Our technical analysis reveals the effects of serial dependence and unknown covariate distribution on the FDR control. We conduct a power analysis of TSKI using the Lasso coefficient difference knockoff statistic under the generalized linear time series models. The finite-sample performance of TSKI is illustrated with several simulation examples and an economic inflation study.</p></details> | 106 pages, 6 figures |

In this paper, we introduce temporal Wasserstein imputation, a novel method for imputing missing data in time series. Unlike existing techniques, our approach is fully nonparametric, circumventing the need for model specification prior to imputation, making it suitable for potential nonlinear dynamics. Its principled algorithmic implementation can seamlessly handle univariate or multivariate time series with any non-systematic missing pattern. In addition, the plausible range and side information of the missing entries (such as box constraints) can easily be incorporated. As a key advantage, our method mitigates the distributional bias typical of many existing approaches, ensuring more reliable downstream statistical analysis using the imputed series. Leveraging the benign landscape of the optimization formulation, we establish the convergence of an alternating minimization algorithm to critical points. We also provide conditions under which the marginal distributions of the underlying time series can be identified. Numerical experiments, including extensive simulations covering linear and nonlinear time series models and a real-world groundwater dataset laden with missing values, corroborate the practical usefulness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose the Amortized Control of continuous State Space Model (ACSSM) for continuous dynamical modeling of time series for irregular and discrete observations. We first present a multi-marginal Doob's $h$-transform to construct a continuous dynamical system conditioned on these irregular observations. Following this, we introduce a variational inference algorithm with a tight evidence lower bound (ELBO), leveraging stochastic optimal control (SOC) theory to approximate the intractable Doob's $h$-transform and simulate the conditioned dynamics. To improve efficiency and scalability during both training and inference, ACSSM leverages auxiliary variable to flexibly parameterize the latent dynamics and amortized control. Additionally, it incorporates a simulation-free latent dynamics framework and a transformer-based data assimilation scheme, facilitating parallel inference of the latent states and ELBO computation. Through empirical evaluations across a variety of real-world datasets, ACSSM demonstrates superior performance in tasks such as classification, regression, interpolation, and extrapolation, while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

It aims to understand human driver attention to focus on specific targets/objects in the driving scene. However, traffic scenes contain not only a large amount of visual information but also semantic information related to driving tasks. Existing methods lack attention to the actual semantic information present in driving scenes. Additionally, the traffic scene is a complex and dynamic process that requires constant attention to objects related to the current driving task. Existing models, influenced by their foundational frameworks, tend to have large parameter counts and complex structures. Therefore, this paper proposes a real-time saliency Mamba network based on the latest Mamba framework. As shown in Figure 1, our model uses very few parameters (0.08M, only 0.09~11.16% of other models), while maintaining SOTA performance or achieving over 98% of the SOTA model's performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The article has been accepted for publication at AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[FoCTTA: Low-Memory Continual Test-Time Adaptation with Focus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20677v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual adaptation to domain shifts at test time (CTTA) is crucial for enhancing the intelligence of deep learning enabled IoT applications. However, prevailing TTA methods, which typically update all batch normalization (BN) layers, exhibit two memory inefficiencies. First, the reliance on BN layers for adaptation necessitates large batch sizes, leading to high memory usage. Second, updating all BN layers requires storing the activations of all BN layers for backpropagation, exacerbating the memory demand. Both factors lead to substantial memory costs, making existing solutions impractical for IoT devices. In this paper, we present FoCTTA, a low-memory CTTA strategy. The key is to automatically identify and adapt a few drift-sensitive representation layers, rather than blindly update all BN layers. The shift from BN to representation layers eliminates the need for large batch sizes. Also, by updating adaptation-critical layers only, FoCTTA avoids storing excessive activations. This focused adaptation approach ensures that FoCTTA is not only memory-efficient but also maintains effective adaptation. Evaluations show that FoCTTA improves the adaptation accuracy over the state-of-the-arts by 4.5%, 4.9%, and 14.8% on CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C under the same memory constraints. Across various batch sizes, FoCTTA reduces the memory usage by 3-fold on average, while improving the accuracy by 8.1%, 3.6%, and 0.2%, respectively, on the three datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[RMP-SAM: Towards Real-Time Multi-Purpose Segment Anything](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10228v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent segmentation methods, which adopt large-scale data training and transformer architecture, aim to create one foundation model that can perform multiple tasks. However, most of these methods rely on heavy encoder and decoder frameworks, hindering their performance in real-time scenarios. To explore real-time segmentation, recent advancements primarily focus on semantic segmentation within specific environments, such as autonomous driving. However, they often overlook the generalization ability of these models across diverse scenarios. Therefore, to fill this gap, this work explores a novel real-time segmentation setting called real-time multi-purpose segmentation. It contains three fundamental sub-tasks: interactive segmentation, panoptic segmentation, and video instance segmentation. Unlike previous methods, which use a specific design for each task, we aim to use only a single end-to-end model to accomplish all these tasks in real-time. To meet real-time requirements and balance multi-task learning, we present a novel dynamic convolution-based method, Real-Time Multi-Purpose SAM (RMP-SAM). It contains an efficient encoder and an efficient decoupled adapter to perform prompt-driven decoding. Moreover, we further explore different training strategies and one new adapter design to boost co-training performance further. We benchmark several strong baselines by extending existing works to support our multi-purpose segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RMP-SAM is effective and generalizes well on proposed benchmarks and other specific semantic tasks. Our implementation of RMP-SAM achieves the optimal balance between accuracy and speed for these tasks.Our code and model are available at https://github.com/xushilin1/RAP-SAM/.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR-...</summary><p>ICLR-2025 (oral).

| **[A Compact Model for Large-Scale Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20634v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal data, which commonly arise in real-world applications such as traffic monitoring, financial transactions, and ride-share demands, represent a special category of multivariate time series. They exhibit two distinct characteristics: high dimensionality and commensurability across spatial locations. These attributes call for computationally efficient modeling approaches and facilitate the use of univariate forecasting models in a channel-independent fashion. SparseTSF, a recently introduced competitive univariate forecasting model, harnesses periodicity to achieve compactness by concentrating on cross-period dynamics, thereby extending the Pareto frontier with respect to model size and predictive performance. Nonetheless, it underperforms on spatio-temporal data due to an inadequate capture of intra-period temporal dependencies. To address this shortcoming, we propose UltraSTF, which integrates a cross-period forecasting module with an ultra-compact shape bank component. Our model effectively detects recurring patterns in time series through the attention mechanism of the shape bank component, thereby strengthening its ability to learn intra-period dynamics. UltraSTF achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LargeST benchmark while employing fewer than 0.2% of the parameters required by the second-best approaches, thus further extending the Pareto frontier of existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[RTGen: Real-Time Generative Detection Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20622v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While open-vocabulary object detectors require predefined categories during inference, generative object detectors overcome this limitation by endowing the model with text generation capabilities. However, existing generative object detection methods directly append an autoregressive language model to an object detector to generate texts for each detected object. This straightforward design leads to structural redundancy and increased processing time. In this paper, we propose a Real-Time GENerative Detection Transformer (RTGen), a real-time generative object detector with a succinct encoder-decoder architecture. Specifically, we introduce a novel Region-Language Decoder (RL-Decoder), which innovatively integrates a non-autoregressive language model into the detection decoder, enabling concurrent processing of object and text information. With these efficient designs, RTGen achieves a remarkable inference speed of 60.41 FPS. Moreover, RTGen obtains 18.6 mAP on the LVIS dataset, outperforming the previous SOTA method by 3.5 mAP.</p></details> |  |

The primary challenge in analyzing such multivariate event times is the presence of informative censoring by the terminal event. While numerous statistical methods have been proposed for a single nonterminal event, i.e., semi-competing risks data, there remains a dearth of tools for analyzing times to multiple nonterminal events. These events involve more complex dependence structures between nonterminal and terminal events and between nonterminal events themselves. This paper introduces a novel modeling framework leveraging the vine copula to directly estimate the joint distribution of the multivariate times to nonterminal and terminal events. Unlike the few existing methods based on multivariate or nested copulas, our model excels in capturing the heterogeneous dependence between each pair of event times in terms of strength and structure. Furthermore, our model allows regression modeling for all the marginal distributions of times to nonterminal and terminal events, a feature lacking in existing methods. We propose a likelihood-based estimation and inference procedure, which can be implemented efficiently in sequential stages. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate the satisfactory finite-sample performance of our proposed stage-wise estimators and analytical variance estimators, as well as their superiority over existing methods. We apply our approach to data from a crowdfunding platform to investigate the relationship between creator-backer interactions of various types and a creator's lifetime on the platform.</p></details> |  |

While this approach has demonstrated strong performance improvements in logical and mathematical reasoning tasks, its application to natural language generation (NLG), especially summarization, has yet to be explored. Multi-Document Summarization (MDS) is a challenging task that focuses on extracting and synthesizing useful information from multiple lengthy documents. Unlike reasoning tasks, MDS requires a more nuanced approach to prompt design and ensemble, as there is no "best" prompt to satisfy diverse summarization requirements. To address this, we propose a novel framework that leverages inference-time scaling for this task. Precisely, we take prompt ensemble approach by leveraging various prompt to first generate candidate summaries and then ensemble them with an aggregator to produce a refined summary. We also introduce two new evaluation metrics: Consistency-Aware Preference (CAP) score and LLM Atom-Content-Unit (ACU) score, to enhance LLM's contextual understanding while mitigating its positional bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving summary quality while identifying and analyzing the scaling boundaries in summarization tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs Have Rhythm: Fingerprinting Large Language Models Using Inter-Token Times and Network Traffic Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20589v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into many technological ecosystems across various domains and industries, identifying which model is deployed or being interacted with is critical for the security and trustworthiness of the systems. Current verification methods typically rely on analyzing the generated output to determine the source model. However, these techniques are susceptible to adversarial attacks, operate in a post-hoc manner, and may require access to the model weights to inject a verifiable fingerprint. In this paper, we propose a novel passive and non-invasive fingerprinting technique that operates in real-time and remains effective even under encrypted network traffic conditions. Our method leverages the intrinsic autoregressive generation nature of language models, which generate text one token at a time based on all previously generated tokens, creating a unique temporal pattern like a rhythm or heartbeat that persists even when the output is streamed over a network. We find that measuring the Inter-Token Times (ITTs)-time intervals between consecutive tokens-can identify different language models with high accuracy. We develop a Deep Learning (DL) pipeline to capture these timing patterns using network traffic analysis and evaluate it on 16 Small Language Models (SLMs) and 10 proprietary LLMs across different deployment scenarios, including local host machine (GPU/CPU), Local Area Network (LAN), Remote Network, and Virtual Private Network (VPN). The experimental results confirm that our proposed technique is effective and maintains high accuracy even when tested in different network conditions. This work opens a new avenue for model identification in real-world scenarios and contributes to more secure and trustworthy language model deployment.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers are now developing Large Time Series Models (LTSMs)-universal transformer-based models that use autoregressive prediction-to improve TSF. However, training LTSMs on heterogeneous time series data poses unique challenges, including diverse frequencies, dimensions, and patterns across datasets. Recent endeavors have studied and evaluated various design choices aimed at enhancing LTSM training and generalization capabilities. However, these design choices are typically studied and evaluated in isolation and are not benchmarked collectively. In this work, we introduce LTSM-Bundle, a comprehensive toolbox, and benchmark for training LTSMs, spanning pre-processing techniques, model configurations, and dataset configuration. It modularized and benchmarked LTSMs from multiple dimensions, encompassing prompting strategies, tokenization approaches, training paradigms, base model selection, data quantity, and dataset diversity. Furthermore, we combine the most effective design choices identified in our study. Empirical results demonstrate that this combination achieves superior zero-shot and few-shot performances compared to state-of-the-art LTSMs and traditional TSF methods on benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[HazardNet: A Small-Scale Vision Language Model for Real-Time Traffic Safety Detection at Edge Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20572v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic safety remains a vital concern in contemporary urban settings, intensified by the increase of vehicles and the complicated nature of road networks. Traditional safety-critical event detection systems predominantly rely on sensor-based approaches and conventional machine learning algorithms, necessitating extensive data collection and complex training processes to adhere to traffic safety regulations. This paper introduces HazardNet, a small-scale Vision Language Model designed to enhance traffic safety by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of advanced language and vision models. We built HazardNet by fine-tuning the pre-trained Qwen2-VL-2B model, chosen for its superior performance among open-source alternatives and its compact size of two billion parameters. This helps to facilitate deployment on edge devices with efficient inference throughput. In addition, we present HazardQA, a novel Vision Question Answering (VQA) dataset constructed specifically for training HazardNet on real-world scenarios involving safety-critical events. Our experimental results show that the fine-tuned HazardNet outperformed the base model up to an 89% improvement in F1-Score and has comparable results with improvement in some cases reach up to 6% when compared to larger models, such as GPT-4o. These advancements underscore the potential of HazardNet in providing real-time, reliable traffic safety event detection, thereby contributing to reduced accidents and improved traffic management in urban environments. Both HazardNet model and the HazardQA dataset are available at https://huggingface.co/Tami3/HazardNet and https://huggingface.co/datasets/Tami3/HazardQA, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, despite deep learning advancements, traditional Transformer-based models often diminish the effect of crucial inter-variable relationships by singular token embedding and struggle to effectively capture complex dependencies among variables, especially in datasets with rare or extreme events. These events create significant imbalances and lead to high skewness, complicating accurate prediction efforts. This study introduces PFformer, a position-free Transformer-based model designed for single-target MTS forecasting, specifically for challenging datasets characterized by extreme variability. PFformer integrates two novel embedding strategies: Enhanced Feature-based Embedding (EFE) and Auto-Encoder-based Embedding (AEE). EFE effectively encodes inter-variable dependencies by mapping related sequence subsets to high-dimensional spaces without positional constraints, enhancing the encoder's functionality. PFformer shows superior forecasting accuracy without the traditional limitations of positional encoding in MTS modeling. We evaluated PFformer across four challenging datasets, focusing on two key forecasting scenarios: long sequence prediction for 3 days ahead and rolling predictions every four hours to reflect real-time decision-making processes in water management. PFformer demonstrated remarkable improvements, from 20% to 60%, compared with state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | <details><summary>PAKDD...</summary><p>PAKDD 2025 special session on Data Science: Foundations and Applications (DSFA)</p></details> |

When runtime checks fail, debugging gradually typed programs becomes cumbersome, because these failures may arise far from the original point where an inconsistent type assumption is made. To ease this burden on developers, some gradually typed languages produce a blame report for a given type inconsistency. However, these reports are sometimes misleading, because they might point to program points that do not need to be changed to stop the error. To overcome the limitations of blame reports, we propose using dynamic program slicing as an alternative approach to help programmers debug run-time type errors. We describe a proof-of-concept for TypeSlicer, a tool that would present dynamic program slices to developers when a runtime check fails. We performed a Wizard-of-Oz user study to investigate how developers respond to dynamic program slices through a set of simulated interactions with TypeScript programs. This formative study shows that developers can understand and apply dynamic slice information to provide change recommendations when debugging runtime type errors.</p></details> |  |

A key challenge in automating this process is predicting how these flexible and branched structures behave under manipulation. Without accurate predictions, it is difficult for robots to reliably plan or execute assembly operations. While existing research has made progress in modeling single-threaded Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs), extending these approaches to Branched Deformable Linear Objects (BDLOs) presents fundamental challenges. The junction points in BDLOs create complex force interactions and strain propagation patterns that cannot be adequately captured by simply connecting multiple single-DLO models. To address these challenges, this paper presents Differentiable discrete branched Elastic rods for modeling Furcated DLOs in real-Time (DEFT), a novel framework that combines a differentiable physics-based model with a learning framework to: 1) accurately model BDLO dynamics, including dynamic propagation at junction points and grasping in the middle of a BDLO, 2) achieve efficient computation for real-time inference, and 3) enable planning to demonstrate dexterous BDLO manipulation. A comprehensive series of real-world experiments demonstrates DEFT's efficacy in terms of accuracy, computational speed, and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art alternatives.

| **[Time series forecasting based on optimized LLM for fault prediction in distribution power grid insulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17341v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surface contamination on electrical grid insulators leads to an increase in leakage current until an electrical discharge occurs, which can result in a power system shutdown. To mitigate the possibility of disruptive faults resulting in a power outage, monitoring contamination and leakage current can help predict the progression of faults. Given this need, this paper proposes a hybrid deep learning (DL) model for predicting the increase in leakage current in high-voltage insulators. The hybrid structure considers a multi-criteria optimization using tree-structured Parzen estimation, an input stage filter for signal noise attenuation combined with a large language model (LLM) applied for time series forecasting. The proposed optimized LLM outperforms state-of-the-art DL models with a root-mean-square error equal to 2.24$\times10^{-4}$ for a short-term horizon and 1.21$\times10^{-3}$ for a medium-term horizon.</p></details> |  |
| **[R2-T2: Re-Routing in Test-Time for Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20395v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In large multimodal models (LMMs), the perception of non-language modalities (e.g., visual representations) is usually not on par with the large language models (LLMs)' powerful reasoning capabilities, deterring LMMs' performance on challenging downstream tasks. This weakness has been recently mitigated by replacing the vision encoder with a mixture-of-experts (MoE), which provides rich, multi-granularity, and diverse representations required by diverse downstream tasks. The performance of multimodal MoE largely depends on its router, which reweights and mixes the representations of different experts for each input. However, we find that the end-to-end trained router does not always produce the optimal routing weights for every test sample. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel and efficient method "Re-Routing in Test-Time(R2-T2) that locally optimizes the vector of routing weights in test-time by moving it toward those vectors of the correctly predicted samples in a neighborhood of the test sample. We propose three R2-T2 strategies with different optimization objectives and neighbor-search spaces. R2-T2 consistently and greatly improves state-of-the-art LMMs' performance on challenging benchmarks of diverse tasks, without training any base-model parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Signature Kernel Computations for Long Time Series via Local Neumann Series Expansions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20392v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The signature kernel is a recent state-of-the-art tool for analyzing high-dimensional sequential data, valued for its theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance. In this paper, we present a novel method for efficiently computing the signature kernel of long, high-dimensional time series via dynamically truncated recursive local power series expansions. Building on the characterization of the signature kernel as the solution of a Goursat PDE, our approach employs tilewise Neumann-series expansions to derive rapidly converging power series approximations of the signature kernel that are locally defined on subdomains and propagated iteratively across the entire domain of the Goursat solution by exploiting the geometry of the time series. Algorithmically, this involves solving a system of interdependent local Goursat PDEs by recursively propagating boundary conditions along a directed graph via topological ordering, with dynamic truncation adaptively terminating each local power series expansion when coefficients fall below machine precision, striking an effective balance between computational cost and accuracy. This method achieves substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art approaches for computing the signature kernel, providing (a) adjustable and superior accuracy, even for time series with very high roughness; (b) drastically reduced memory requirements; and (c) scalability to efficiently handle very long time series (e.g., with up to half a million points or more) on a single GPU. These advantages make our method particularly well-suited for rough-path-assisted machine learning, financial modeling, and signal processing applications that involve very long and highly volatile data.</p></details> | 18 pages, 3 figures |

One common strategy uses verifiers to evaluate candidate outputs. In this work, we propose a novel scaling dimension for test-time compute: scaling the number of verifiers. We introduce Multi-Agent Verification (MAV) as a test-time compute paradigm that combines multiple verifiers to improve performance. We propose using Aspect Verifiers (AVs), off-the-shelf LLMs prompted to verify different aspects of outputs, as one possible choice for the verifiers in a MAV system. AVs are a convenient building block for MAV since they can be easily combined without additional training. Moreover, we introduce BoN-MAV, a simple multi-agent verification algorithm that combines best-of-n sampling with multiple verifiers. BoN-MAV demonstrates stronger scaling patterns than self-consistency and reward model verification, and we demonstrate both weak-to-strong generalization, where combining weak verifiers improves even stronger LLMs, and self-improvement, where the same base model is used to both generate and verify outputs. Our results establish scaling the number of verifiers as a promising new dimension for improving language model performance at test-time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Gaussian Splatting for Monocular Dynamic Scene Rendering via Sparse Time-Variant Attribute Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20378v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rendering dynamic scenes from monocular videos is a crucial yet challenging task. The recent deformable Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a robust solution to represent real-world dynamic scenes. However, it often leads to heavily redundant Gaussians, attempting to fit every training view at various time steps, leading to slower rendering speeds. Additionally, the attributes of Gaussians in static areas are time-invariant, making it unnecessary to model every Gaussian, which can cause jittering in static regions. In practice, the primary bottleneck in rendering speed for dynamic scenes is the number of Gaussians. In response, we introduce Efficient Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (EDGS), which represents dynamic scenes via sparse time-variant attribute modeling. Our approach formulates dynamic scenes using a sparse anchor-grid representation, with the motion flow of dense Gaussians calculated via a classical kernel representation. Furthermore, we propose an unsupervised strategy to efficiently filter out anchors corresponding to static areas. Only anchors associated with deformable objects are input into MLPs to query time-variant attributes. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our EDGS significantly improves the rendering speed with superior rendering quality compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |

Real-time AutoML enables the design process to happen while the ML algorithm is being applied to a task. Real-time AutoML is an emerging research area, as such existing real-time AutoML techniques need improvement with respect to the quality of designs and time taken to create designs. To address these issues, this study proposes an Online Meta-learning for AutoML in Real-time (OnMAR) approach. Meta-learning gathers information about the optimisation process undertaken by the ML algorithm in the form of meta-features. Meta-features are used in conjunction with a meta-learner to optimise the optimisation process. The OnMAR approach uses a meta-learner to predict the accuracy of an ML design. If the accuracy predicted by the meta-learner is sufficient, the design is used, and if the predicted accuracy is low, an optimisation technique creates a new design. A genetic algorithm (GA) is the optimisation technique used as part of the OnMAR approach. Different meta-learners (k-nearest neighbours, random forest and XGBoost) are tested. The OnMAR approach is model-agnostic (i.e. not specific to a single real-time AutoML application) and therefore evaluated on three different real-time AutoML applications, namely: composing an image clustering algorithm, configuring the hyper-parameters of a convolutional neural network, and configuring a video classification pipeline. The OnMAR approach is effective, matching or outperforming existing real-time AutoML approaches, with the added benefit of a faster runtime.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First page is a graphical abstract, this is a journal article submission</p></details> |

Determining a combinatorial interpretation for the Kronecker and plethysm coefficients is a major open problem, and prompts the consideration of their computational complexity. Recently it was shown that they behave relatively well with respect to quantum computation, and for some large families there are polynomial time quantum algorithms [Larocca,Havlicek, arXiv:2407.17649] (also [BCGHZ,arXiv:2302.11454]). In this paper we show that for many of those cases the Kronecker and plethysm coefficients can also be computed in polynomial time via classical algorithms, thereby refuting some of the conjectures in [LH24]. This vastly limits the cases in which the desired super-polynomial quantum speedup could be achieved.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[A Polynomial-Time Approximation for Pairwise Fair $k$-Median Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10378v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we study pairwise fair clustering with $\ell \ge 2$ groups, where for every cluster $C$ and every group $i \in [\ell]$, the number of points in $C$ from group $i$ must be at most $t$ times the number of points in $C$ from any other group $j \in [\ell]$, for a given integer $t$. To the best of our knowledge, only bi-criteria approximation and exponential-time algorithms follow for this problem from the prior work on fair clustering problems when $\ell > 2$. In our work, focusing on the $\ell > 2$ case, we design the first polynomial-time $O(k^2\cdot \ell \cdot t)$-approximation for this problem with $k$-median cost that does not violate the fairness constraints. We complement our algorithmic result by providing hardness of approximation results, which show that our problem even when $\ell=2$ is almost as hard as the popular uniform capacitated $k$-median, for which no polynomial-time algorithm with an approximation factor of $o(\log k)$ is known.</p></details> |  |
| **[Testing Prioritized Composite Endpoint with Multiple Follow-up Time Examinations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20180v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composite endpoints are widely used in cardiovascular clinical trials. In recent years, hierarchical composite endpoints-particularly the win ratio approach and its predecessor, the Finkelstein-Schoenfeld (FS) test, also known as the unmatched win ratio test-have gained popularity. These methods involve comparing individuals across multiple endpoints, ranked by priority, with mortality typically assigned the highest priority in many applications. However, these methods have not accounted for varying treatment effects, known as non-constant hazards over time in the context of survival analysis. To address this limitation, we propose an adaptation of the FS test that incorporates progressive follow-up time, which we will refer to as ProFS. This proposed test can jointly evaluate treatment effects at various follow-up time points by incorporating the maximum of several FS test statistics calculated at those specific times. Moreover, ProFS also supports clinical trials with group sequential monitoring strategies, providing flexibility in trial design. As demonstrated through extensive simulations, ProFS offers increased statistical power in scenarios where the treatment effect is mainly in the short term or when the second (non-fatal) layer might be concealed by a lack of effect or weak effect on the top (fatal) layer. We also apply ProFS to the SPRINT clinical trial, illustrating how our proposed method improves the performance of FS.</p></details> |  |
| **[GSA-Forecaster: Forecasting Graph-Based Time-Dependent Data with Graph Sequence Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05914v4)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting graph-based, time-dependent data has broad practical applications but presents challenges. Effective models must capture both spatial and temporal dependencies in the data, while also incorporating auxiliary information to enhance prediction accuracy. In this paper, we identify limitations in current state-of-the-art models regarding temporal dependency handling. To overcome this, we introduce GSA-Forecaster, a new deep learning model designed for forecasting in graph-based, time-dependent contexts. GSA-Forecaster utilizes graph sequence attention, a new attention mechanism proposed in this paper, to effectively manage temporal dependencies. GSA-Forecaster integrates the data's graph structure directly into its architecture, addressing spatial dependencies. Additionally, it incorporates auxiliary information to refine its predictions further. We validate its performance using real-world graph-based, time-dependent datasets, where it demonstrates superior effectiveness compared to existing state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Near-Linear Time Projection onto the $\ell_{1,\infty}$ Ball; Application to Sparse Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09836v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Looking for sparsity is nowadays crucial to speed up the training of large-scale neural networks. Projections onto the $\ell_{1,2}$ and $\ell_{1,\infty}$ are among the most efficient techniques to sparsify and reduce the overall cost of neural networks. In this paper, we introduce a new projection algorithm for the $\ell_{1,\infty}$ norm ball. The worst-case time complexity of this algorithm is $\mathcal{O}\big(nm+J\log(nm)\big)$ for a matrix in $\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}$. $J$ is a term that tends to 0 when the sparsity is high, and to $nm$ when the sparsity is low. Its implementation is easy and it is guaranteed to converge to the exact solution in a finite time. Moreover, we propose to incorporate the $\ell_{1,\infty}$ ball projection while training an autoencoder to enforce feature selection and sparsity of the weights. Sparsification appears in the encoder to primarily do feature selection due to our application in biology, where only a very small part ($<2\%$) of the data is relevant. We show that both in the biological case and in the general case of sparsity that our method is the fastest.</p></details> | 22 pages, 8 figures |
| **[On window mean survival time with interval-censored data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20011v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, cancer clinical trials have increasingly encountered non proportional hazards (NPH) scenarios, particularly with the emergence of immunotherapy. In randomized controlled trials comparing immunotherapy with conventional chemotherapy or placebo, late difference and early crossing survivals scenarios are commonly observed. In such cases, window mean survival time (WMST), the area under the survival curve within a pre-specified interval $[\tau_0, \tau_1]$, has gained increasing attention due to its superior power compared to restricted mean survival time (RMST), the area under the survival curve up to a pre-specified time point. Considering the increasing use of progression-free survival as a co-primary endpoint alongside overall survival, there is a critical need to establish a WMST estimation method for interval-censored data; however, sufficient research has yet to be conducted. To bridge this gap, this study proposes a WMST inference method utilizing one-point imputations and Turnbull's method. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate that the WMST estimation method using mid-point imputation for interval-censored data exhibits comparable performance to that using Turnbull's method. Since the former facilitates standard error calculation, we adopt it as the standard method. Numerical simulations on two-sample tests confirm that the proposed WMST testing method have higher power than RMST in late difference and early crossing survival scenarios, while having compatible power to the log-rank test under the PH. Furthermore, even when pre-specified $\tau_0$ deviated from the clinically desirable time point, WMST consistently maintains higher power than RMST in late difference and early crossing survivals scenarios.</p></details> | 21 pages, 3 figures |

One of the key challenges is processing sequences with long-range dependencies. To that end, a recent line of work applied the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), which partitions the sequence into multiple subsequences and applies a Fourier transform to each separately. We propose the Frequency Information Aggregation (FIA)-Net, which is based on a novel complex-valued MLP architecture that aggregates adjacent window information in the frequency domain. To further increase the receptive field of the FIA-Net, we treat the set of windows as hyper-complex (HC) valued vectors and employ HC algebra to efficiently combine information from all STFT windows altogether. Using the HC-MLP backbone allows for improved handling of sequences with long-term dependence. Furthermore, due to the nature of HC operations, the HC-MLP uses up to three times fewer parameters than the equivalent standard window aggregation method. We evaluate the FIA-Net on various time-series benchmarks and show that the proposed methodologies outperform existing state of the art methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Our code is publicly available on https://anonymous.4open.science/r/research-1803/.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures.

The model is trained in a Bayesian framework that accounts for the uncertainty about the latent function and marginalizes it out when making predictions. We couple the latent GP variable with two types of forecast distributions: the negative binomial (NegBinGP) and the Tweedie distribution (TweedieGP). While the negative binomial has already been used in forecasting intermittent time series, this is the first time in which a fully parameterized Tweedie density is used for intermittent time series. We properly evaluate the Tweedie density, which is both zero-inflated and heavy tailed, avoiding simplifying assumptions made in existing models. We test our models on thousands of intermittent count time series. Results show that our models provide consistently better probabilistic forecasts than the competitors. In particular, TweedieGP obtains the best estimates of the highest quantiles, thus showing that it is more flexible than NegBinGP.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[NeuralDEM -- Real-time Simulation of Industrial Particulate Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09678v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in computing power have made it possible to numerically simulate large-scale fluid-mechanical and/or particulate systems, many of which are integral to core industrial processes. Among the different numerical methods available, the discrete element method (DEM) provides one of the most accurate representations of a wide range of physical systems involving granular and discontinuous materials. Consequently, DEM has become a widely accepted approach for tackling engineering problems connected to granular flows and powder mechanics. Additionally, DEM can be integrated with grid-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods, enabling the simulation of chemical processes taking place, e.g., in fluidized beds. However, DEM is computationally intensive because of the intrinsic multiscale nature of particulate systems, restricting simulation duration or number of particles. Towards this end, NeuralDEM presents an end-to-end approach to replace slow numerical DEM routines with fast, adaptable deep learning surrogates. NeuralDEM is capable of picturing long-term transport processes across different regimes using macroscopic observables without any reference to microscopic model parameters. First, NeuralDEM treats the Lagrangian discretization of DEM as an underlying continuous field, while simultaneously modeling macroscopic behavior directly as additional auxiliary fields. Second, NeuralDEM introduces multi-branch neural operators scalable to real-time modeling of industrially-sized scenarios - from slow and pseudo-steady to fast and transient. Such scenarios have previously posed insurmountable challenges for deep learning models. Notably, NeuralDEM faithfully models coupled CFD-DEM fluidized bed reactors of 160k CFD cells and 500k DEM particles for trajectories of 28s. NeuralDEM will open many new doors to advanced engineering and much faster process cycles.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://nx-ai.github.io/NeuralDEM/</p></details> |

Although prior approaches have achieved some progress, they typically either demand substantial computational resources or are constrained by the limitations of the original feature space, rendering them less effective for test-time adaptation tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free feature space rotation with basis transformation for test-time adaptation. By leveraging the inherent distinctions among classes, we reconstruct the original feature space and map it to a new representation, thereby enhancing the clarity of class differences and providing more effective guidance for the model during testing. Additionally, to better capture relevant information from various classes, we maintain a dynamic queue to store representative samples. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of both performance and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, estimating these quantities remains an open problem, particularly in the case of high-dimensional discrete distributions. Current approaches typically rely on embedding discrete data into a continuous space and applying neural estimators originally designed for continuous distributions, a process that may not fully capture the discrete nature of the underlying data. We consider Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMCs), stochastic processes on discrete state-spaces which have gained popularity due to their generative modeling applications. In this work, we introduce INFO-SEDD, a novel method for estimating information-theoretic quantities of discrete data, including mutual information and entropy. Our approach requires the training of a single parametric model, offering significant computational and memory advantages. Additionally, it seamlessly integrates with pretrained networks, allowing for efficient reuse of pretrained generative models. To evaluate our approach, we construct a challenging synthetic benchmark. Our experiments demonstrate that INFO-SEDD is robust and outperforms neural competitors that rely on embedding techniques. Moreover, we validate our method on a real-world task: estimating the entropy of an Ising model. Overall, INFO-SEDD outperforms competing methods and shows scalability to high-dimensional scenarios, paving the way for new applications where estimating MI between discrete distribution is the focus.

While recent techniques seek to address this for images, our findings show that these approaches fail to provide shift-invariance in time series, where the data generation mechanism is more challenging due to the interaction of low and high frequencies. Worse, they also decrease performance across several tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel differentiable bijective function that maps samples from their high-dimensional data manifold to another manifold of the same dimension, without any dimensional reduction. Our approach guarantees that samples -- when subjected to random shifts -- are mapped to a unique point in the manifold while preserving all task-relevant information without loss. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that the proposed transformation guarantees shift-invariance in deep learning models without imposing any limits to the shift. Our experiments on six time series tasks with state-of-the-art methods show that our approach consistently improves the performance while enabling models to achieve complete shift-invariance without modifying or imposing restrictions on the model's topology.

However, this trial-and-error approach often leads to high computational overhead and error propagation, where early mistakes can derail subsequent steps. To address these issues, we introduce Meta-Reasoner, a framework that dynamically optimizes inference-time reasoning by enabling LLMs to "think about how to think." Drawing inspiration from human meta-cognition and dual-process theory, Meta-Reasoner operates as a strategic advisor, decoupling high-level guidance from step-by-step generation. It employs "contextual multi-armed bandits" to iteratively evaluate reasoning progress, and select optimal strategies (e.g., backtrack, clarify ambiguity, restart from scratch, or propose alternative approaches), and reallocates computational resources toward the most promising paths. Our evaluations on mathematical reasoning and puzzles highlight the potential of dynamic reasoning chains to overcome inherent challenges in the LLM reasoning process and also show promise in broader applications, offering a scalable and adaptable solution for reasoning-intensive tasks.</p></details> | Work in progress |

To address these challenges, this study proposes the ColorDynamic framework. First, an end-to-end DRL formulation is established, which maps raw sensor data directly to control commands, thereby ensuring compatibility with unstructured environments. Under this formulation, a novel network, Transqer, is introduced. The Transqer enables online DRL learning from temporal transitions, substantially enhancing decision-making in dynamic scenarios. To facilitate scalable training of Transqer with diverse data, an efficient simulation platform E-Sparrow, along with a data augmentation technique leveraging symmetric invariance, are developed. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art methods, alongside assessments of generalizability, scalability, and real-time performance, were conducted to validate the effectiveness of ColorDynamic. Results indicate that our approach achieves a success rate exceeding 90% while exhibiting real-time capacity (1.2-1.3 ms per planning). Additionally, ablation studies were performed to corroborate the contributions of individual components. Building on this, the OkayPlan-ColorDynamic (OPCD) navigation system is presented, with simulated and real-world experiments demonstrating its superiority and applicability in complex scenarios. The codebase and experimental demonstrations have been open-sourced on our website to facilitate reproducibility and further research.</p></details> | 18 pages |

Standard deep neural network (DNN) based machine learning proxies are ineffective in practical settings where labeled data is scarce and training times are limited. We propose a semi-supervised Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) based optimization proxy for this complex regime, wherein training commences in a sandwiched fashion, alternating between a supervised learning step for minimizing cost, and an unsupervised learning step for enforcing constraint feasibility. We show that the proposed semi-supervised BNN outperforms DNN architectures on important non-convex constrained optimization problems from energy network operations, achieving up to a tenfold reduction in expected maximum equality gap and halving the inequality gaps. Further, the BNN's ability to provide posterior samples is leveraged to construct practically meaningful probabilistic confidence bounds on performance using a limited validation data, unlike prior methods.</p></details> |  |

ODE-based samplers offer rapid sampling time but reach a performance limit, whereas SDE-based samplers achieve superior quality, albeit with longer iterations. In this work, we formulate the sampling process as an Extended Reverse-Time SDE (ER SDE), unifying prior explorations into ODEs and SDEs. Theoretically, leveraging the semi-linear structure of ER SDE solutions, we offer exact solutions and approximate solutions for VP SDE and VE SDE, respectively. Based on the approximate solution space of the ER SDE, referred to as one-step prediction errors, we yield mathematical insights elucidating the rapid sampling capability of ODE solvers and the high-quality sampling ability of SDE solvers. Additionally, we unveil that VP SDE solvers stand on par with their VE SDE counterparts. Based on these findings, leveraging the dual advantages of ODE solvers and SDE solvers, we devise efficient high-quality samplers, namely ER-SDE-Solvers. Experimental results demonstrate that ER-SDE-Solvers achieve state-of-the-art performance across all stochastic samplers while maintaining efficiency of deterministic samplers. Specifically, on the ImageNet $128\times128$ dataset, ER-SDE-Solvers obtain 8.33 FID in only 20 function evaluations.

Our method is founded on the observation that attention difference in the diffusion process exhibits a U-shaped pattern, indicating significant redundancy. We mitigate this by broadcasting attention outputs to subsequent steps in a pyramid style. It applies different broadcast strategies to each attention based on their variance for best efficiency. We further introduce broadcast sequence parallel for more efficient distributed inference. PAB demonstrates up to 10.5x speedup across three models compared to baselines, achieving real-time generation for up to 720p videos. We anticipate that our simple yet effective method will serve as a robust baseline and facilitate future research and application for video generation.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[Time-MoE: Billion-Scale Time Series Foundation Models with Mixture of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16040v4)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning for time series forecasting has seen significant advancements over the past decades. However, despite the success of large-scale pre-training in language and vision domains, pre-trained time series models remain limited in scale and operate at a high cost, hindering the development of larger capable forecasting models in real-world applications. In response, we introduce Time-MoE, a scalable and unified architecture designed to pre-train larger, more capable forecasting foundation models while reducing inference costs. By leveraging a sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) design, Time-MoE enhances computational efficiency by activating only a subset of networks for each prediction, reducing computational load while maintaining high model capacity. This allows Time-MoE to scale effectively without a corresponding increase in inference costs. Time-MoE comprises a family of decoder-only transformer models that operate in an auto-regressive manner and support flexible forecasting horizons with varying input context lengths. We pre-trained these models on our newly introduced large-scale data Time-300B, which spans over 9 domains and encompassing over 300 billion time points. For the first time, we scaled a time series foundation model up to 2.4 billion parameters, achieving significantly improved forecasting precision. Our results validate the applicability of scaling laws for training tokens and model size in the context of time series forecasting. Compared to dense models with the same number of activated parameters or equivalent computation budgets, our models consistently outperform them by large margin. These advancements position Time-MoE as a state-of-the-art solution for tackling real-world time series forecasting challenges with superior capability, efficiency, and flexibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |

To eliminate load shedding bias against specific regions in the system, optimization-based methods are uniquely positioned to help balance between economic and fairness considerations. However, the resulting optimization problem involves complex constraints, which can be time-consuming to solve and thus cannot meet the real-time requirements of load shedding. To tackle this challenge, in this paper we present an efficient machine learning algorithm to enable millisecond-level computation for the optimization-based load shedding problem. Numerical studies on both a 3-bus toy example and a realistic RTS-GMLC system have demonstrated the validity and efficiency of the proposed algorithm for delivering fairness-aware and real-time load shedding decisions.</p></details> |  |

The emergence of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies has heightened the demand for real-time performance in these applications. However, current state-of-the-art models often exhibit promising results at the expense of substantial computational overhead. In this paper, we present a query-optimized real-time Transformer (QORT-Former), the first Transformer-based real-time framework for 3D pose estimation of two hands and an object. We first limit the number of queries and decoders to meet the efficiency requirement. Given limited number of queries and decoders, we propose to optimize queries which are taken as input to the Transformer decoder, to secure better accuracy: (1) we propose to divide queries into three types (a left hand query, a right hand query and an object query) and enhance query features (2) by using the contact information between hands and an object and (3) by using three-step update of enhanced image and query features with respect to one another. With proposed methods, we achieved real-time pose estimation performance using just 108 queries and 1 decoder (53.5 FPS on an RTX 3090TI GPU). Surpassing state-of-the-art results on the H2O dataset by 17.6% (left hand), 22.8% (right hand), and 27.2% (object), as well as on the FPHA dataset by 5.3% (right hand) and 10.4% (object), our method excels in accuracy.

| **[Learning with Exact Invariances in Polynomial Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19758v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the statistical-computational trade-offs for learning with exact invariances (or symmetries) using kernel regression. Traditional methods, such as data augmentation, group averaging, canonicalization, and frame-averaging, either fail to provide a polynomial-time solution or are not applicable in the kernel setting. However, with oracle access to the geometric properties of the input space, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm that learns a classifier with \emph{exact} invariances. Moreover, our approach achieves the same excess population risk (or generalization error) as the original kernel regression problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first polynomial-time algorithm to achieve exact (not approximate) invariances in this context. Our proof leverages tools from differential geometry, spectral theory, and optimization. A key result in our development is a new reformulation of the problem of learning under invariances as optimizing an infinite number of linearly constrained convex quadratic programs, which may be of independent interest.</p></details> |  |

This hardware is optimized for inference near detectors in high-throughput X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) facilities like the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). To fit FPGA constraints, we optimized SpeckleNN, reducing parameters from 5.6M to 64.6K (98.8% reduction) with 90% accuracy. We also compressed the latent space from 128 to 50 dimensions. Deployed on a KCU1500 FPGA, the model used 71% of DSPs, 75% of LUTs, and 48% of FFs, with an average power consumption of 9.4W. The FPGA achieved 45.015us inference latency at 200 MHz. On an NVIDIA A100 GPU, the same inference consumed ~73W and had a 400us latency. Our FPGA version achieved an 8.9x speedup and 7.8x power reduction over the GPU. Key advancements include model specialization and dynamic weight loading through SNL, eliminating time-consuming FPGA re-synthesis for fast, continuous deployment of (re)trained models. These innovations enable real-time adaptive classification and efficient speckle pattern vetoing, making SpeckleNN ideal for XFEL facilities. This implementation accelerates SPI experiments and enhances adaptability to evolving conditions.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often overlook the capability to generalize effectively across arbitrary unseen modalities. In this paper, we introduce a novel Test-Time Modality Generalization (TTMG) framework, which comprises two core components: Modality-Aware Style Projection (MASP) and Modality-Sensitive Instance Whitening (MSIW), designed to enhance generalization in arbitrary unseen modality datasets. The MASP estimates the likelihood of a test instance belonging to each seen modality and maps it onto a distribution using modality-specific style bases, guiding its projection effectively. Furthermore, as high feature covariance hinders generalization to unseen modalities, the MSIW is applied during training to selectively suppress modality-sensitive information while retaining modality-invariant features. By integrating MASP and MSIW, the TTMG framework demonstrates robust generalization capabilities for medical image segmentation in unseen modalities a challenge that current methods have largely neglected. We evaluated TTMG alongside other domain generalization techniques across eleven datasets spanning four modalities (colonoscopy, ultrasound, dermoscopy, and radiology), consistently achieving superior segmentation performance across various modality combinations.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages and 15 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2502.09931</p></details> |

| **[Revisiting a Design Choice in Gradient Temporal Difference Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01170v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Off-policy learning enables a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to reason counterfactually about policies that are not executed and is one of the most important ideas in RL. It, however, can lead to instability when combined with function approximation and bootstrapping, two arguably indispensable ingredients for large-scale reinforcement learning. This is the notorious deadly triad. The seminal work Sutton et al. (2008) pioneers Gradient Temporal Difference learning (GTD) as the first solution to the deadly triad, which has enjoyed massive success thereafter. During the derivation of GTD, some intermediate algorithm, called $A^\top$TD, was invented but soon deemed inferior. In this paper, we revisit this $A^\top$TD and prove that a variant of $A^\top$TD, called $A_t^\top$TD, is also an effective solution to the deadly triad. Furthermore, this $A_t^\top$TD only needs one set of parameters and one learning rate. By contrast, GTD has two sets of parameters and two learning rates, making it hard to tune in practice. We provide asymptotic analysis for $A^\top_t$TD and finite sample analysis for a variant of $A^\top_t$TD that additionally involves a projection operator. The convergence rate of this variant is on par with the canonical on-policy temporal difference learning.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[TRENDy: Temporal Regression of Effective Nonlinear Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03496v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal dynamics pervade the natural sciences, from the morphogen dynamics underlying patterning in animal pigmentation to the protein waves controlling cell division. A central challenge lies in understanding how controllable parameters induce qualitative changes in system behavior called bifurcations. This endeavor is particularly difficult in realistic settings where governing partial differential equations (PDEs) are unknown and data is limited and noisy. To address this challenge, we propose TRENDy (Temporal Regression of Effective Nonlinear Dynamics), an equation-free approach to learning low-dimensional, predictive models of spatiotemporal dynamics. TRENDy first maps input data to a low-dimensional space of effective dynamics through a cascade of multiscale filtering operations. Our key insight is the recognition that these effective dynamics can be fit by a neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) having the same parameter space as the input PDE. The preceding filtering operations strongly regularize the phase space of the NODE, making TRENDy significantly more robust to noise compared to existing methods. We train TRENDy to predict the effective dynamics of synthetic and real data representing dynamics from across the physical and life sciences. We then demonstrate how we can automatically locate both Turing and Hopf bifurcations in unseen regions of parameter space. We finally apply our method to the analysis of spatial patterning of the ocellated lizard through development. We found that TRENDy's predicted effective state not only accurately predicts spatial changes over time but also identifies distinct pattern features unique to different anatomical regions, such as the tail, neck, and body--an insight that highlights the potential influence of surface geometry on reaction-diffusion mechanisms and their role in driving spatially varying pattern dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 14 appendix pages, 5 figures, 7 appendix figures.

We explore this challenge in the traditional offline RL setting, where an agent must learn how to make decisions based on data collected through a stochastic behavior policy. We present \textit{Latent Macro Action Planner} (L-MAP), which addresses this challenge by learning a set of temporally extended macro-actions through a state-conditional Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), effectively reducing action dimensionality. L-MAP employs a (separate) learned prior model that acts as a latent transition model and allows efficient sampling of plausible actions. During planning, our approach accounts for stochasticity in both the environment and the behavior policy by using Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). In offline RL settings, including stochastic continuous control tasks, L-MAP efficiently searches over discrete latent actions to yield high expected returns. Empirical results demonstrate that L-MAP maintains low decision latency despite increased action dimensionality. Notably, across tasks ranging from continuous control with inherently stochastic dynamics to high-dimensional robotic hand manipulation, L-MAP significantly outperforms existing model-based methods and performs on-par with strong model-free actor-critic baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed approach in planning in complex and stochastic environments with high-dimensional action spaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR2025.

| **[A Survey of Link Prediction in Temporal Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21185v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal networks have gained significant prominence in the past decade for modelling dynamic interactions within complex systems. A key challenge in this domain is Temporal Link Prediction (TLP), which aims to forecast future connections by analysing historical network structures across various applications including social network analysis. While existing surveys have addressed specific aspects of TLP, they typically lack a comprehensive framework that distinguishes between representation and inference methods. This survey bridges this gap by introducing a novel taxonomy that explicitly examines representation and inference from existing methods, providing a novel classification of approaches for TLP. We analyse how different representation techniques capture temporal and structural dynamics, examining their compatibility with various inference methods for both transductive and inductive prediction tasks. Our taxonomy not only clarifies the methodological landscape but also reveals promising unexplored combinations of existing techniques. This taxonomy provides a systematic foundation for emerging challenges in TLP, including model explainability and scalable architectures for complex temporal networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting clinical outcomes from patient care pathways represented with temporal knowledge graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21138v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: With the increasing availability of healthcare data, predictive modeling finds many applications in the biomedical domain, such as the evaluation of the level of risk for various conditions, which in turn can guide clinical decision making. However, it is unclear how knowledge graph data representations and their embedding, which are competitive in some settings, could be of interest in biomedical predictive modeling. Method: We simulated synthetic but realistic data of patients with intracranial aneurysm and experimented on the task of predicting their clinical outcome. We compared the performance of various classification approaches on tabular data versus a graph-based representation of the same data. Next, we investigated how the adopted schema for representing first individual data and second temporal data impacts predictive performances. Results: Our study illustrates that in our case, a graph representation and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) embeddings reach the best performance for a predictive task from observational data. We emphasize the importance of the adopted schema and of the consideration of literal values in the representation of individual data. Our study also moderates the relative impact of various time encoding on GCN performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Realizing temporal transportation trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18513v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study the complexity of the periodic temporal graph realization problem with respect to upper bounds on the fastest path durations among its vertices. This constraint with respect to upper bounds appears naturally in transportation network design applications where, for example, a road network is given, and the goal is to appropriately schedule periodic travel routes, while not exceeding some desired upper bounds on the travel times. In our work, we focus only on underlying tree topologies, which are fundamental in many transportation network applications. As it turns out, the periodic upper-bounded temporal tree realization problem (TTR) has a very different computational complexity behavior than both (i) the classic graph realization problem with respect to shortest path distances in static graphs and (ii) the periodic temporal graph realization problem with exact given fastest travel times (which was recently introduced). First, we prove that, surprisingly, TTR is NP-hard, even for a constant period $\Delta$ and when the input tree $G$ satisfies at least one of the following conditions: (a) $G$ is a star, or (b) $G$ has constant maximum degree. Second, we prove that TTR is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) with respect to the number of leaves in the input tree $G$, via a novel combination of techniques for totally unimodular matrices and mixed integer linear programming.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extending Dense Passage Retrieval with Temporal Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21024v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal awareness is crucial in many information retrieval tasks, particularly in scenarios where the relevance of documents depends on their alignment with the query's temporal context. Traditional retrieval methods such as BM25 and Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) excel at capturing lexical and semantic relevance but fall short in addressing time-sensitive queries. To bridge this gap, we introduce the temporal retrieval model that integrates explicit temporal signals by incorporating query timestamps and document dates into the representation space. Our approach ensures that retrieved passages are not only topically relevant but also temporally aligned with user intent. We evaluate our approach on two large-scale benchmark datasets, ArchivalQA and ChroniclingAmericaQA, achieving substantial performance gains over standard retrieval baselines. In particular, our model improves Top-1 retrieval accuracy by 6.63% and NDCG@10 by 3.79% on ArchivalQA, while yielding a 9.56% boost in Top-1 retrieval accuracy and 4.68% in NDCG@10 on ChroniclingAmericaQA. Additionally, we introduce a time-sensitive negative sampling strategy, which refines the model's ability to distinguish between temporally relevant and irrelevant documents during training. Our findings highlight the importance of explicitly modeling time in retrieval systems and set a new standard for handling temporally grounded queries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Soften the Mask: Adaptive Temporal Soft Mask for Efficient Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21004v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) facilitates the understanding of psychological intentions through non-verbal communication. Existing methods struggle to manage irrelevant information, such as background noise and redundant semantics, which impacts both efficiency and effectiveness. In this work, we propose a novel supervised temporal soft masked autoencoder network for DFER, namely AdaTosk, which integrates a parallel supervised classification branch with the self-supervised reconstruction branch. The self-supervised reconstruction branch applies random binary hard mask to generate diverse training samples, encouraging meaningful feature representations in visible tokens. Meanwhile the classification branch employs an adaptive temporal soft mask to flexibly mask visible tokens based on their temporal significance. Its two key components, respectively of, class-agnostic and class-semantic soft masks, serve to enhance critical expression moments and reduce semantic redundancy over time. Extensive experiments conducted on widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that our AdaTosk remarkably reduces computational costs compared with current state-of-the-art methods while still maintaining competitive performance.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[JiTTER: Jigsaw Temporal Transformer for Event Reconstruction for Self-Supervised Sound Event Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20857v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sound event detection (SED) has significantly benefited from self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches, particularly masked audio transformer for SED (MAT-SED), which leverages masked block prediction to reconstruct missing audio segments. However, while effective in capturing global dependencies, masked block prediction disrupts transient sound events and lacks explicit enforcement of temporal order, making it less suitable for fine-grained event boundary detection. To address these limitations, we propose JiTTER (Jigsaw Temporal Transformer for Event Reconstruction), an SSL framework designed to enhance temporal modeling in transformer-based SED. JiTTER introduces a hierarchical temporal shuffle reconstruction strategy, where audio sequences are randomly shuffled at both the block-level and frame-level, forcing the model to reconstruct the correct temporal order. This pretraining objective encourages the model to learn both global event structures and fine-grained transient details, improving its ability to detect events with sharp onset-offset characteristics. Additionally, we incorporate noise injection during block shuffle, providing a subtle perturbation mechanism that further regularizes feature learning and enhances model robustness. Experimental results on the DESED dataset demonstrate that JiTTER outperforms MAT-SED, achieving a 5.89% improvement in PSDS, highlighting the effectiveness of explicit temporal reasoning in SSL-based SED. Our findings suggest that structured temporal reconstruction tasks, rather than simple masked prediction, offer a more effective pretraining paradigm for sound event representation learning.</p></details> |  |

Current methods fall into two main categories: single-person-based methods and separate modeling-based methods. To delve into this field, we abstract the overall generation process into a general framework MetaMotion, which consists of two phases: temporal modeling and interaction mixing. For temporal modeling, the single-person-based methods concatenate two people into a single one directly, while the separate modeling-based methods skip the modeling of interaction sequences. The inadequate modeling described above resulted in sub-optimal performance and redundant model parameters. In this paper, we introduce TIMotion (Temporal and Interactive Modeling), an efficient and effective framework for human-human motion generation. Specifically, we first propose Causal Interactive Injection to model two separate sequences as a causal sequence leveraging the temporal and causal properties. Then we present Role-Evolving Scanning to adjust to the change in the active and passive roles throughout the interaction. Finally, to generate smoother and more rational motion, we design Localized Pattern Amplification to capture short-term motion patterns. Extensive experiments on InterHuman and InterX demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance. The project code will be released upon acceptance.

In this study, we propose a Two-Stream Spatial-Temporal Transformer Framework for person identification using upper body keypoints visible during online conversations, which we term conversational keypoints. Our framework processes both spatial relationships between keypoints and their temporal evolution through two specialized branches: a Spatial Transformer (STR) that learns distinctive structural patterns in keypoint configurations, and a Temporal Transformer (TTR) that captures sequential motion patterns. Using the state-of-the-art Sapiens pose estimator, we extract 133 keypoints (based on COCO-WholeBody format) representing facial features, head pose, and hand positions. The framework was evaluated on a dataset of 114 individuals engaged in natural conversations, achieving recognition accuracies of 80.12% for the spatial stream, 63.61% for the temporal stream. We then explored two fusion strategies: a shared loss function approach achieving 82.22% accuracy, and a feature-level fusion method that concatenates feature maps from both streams, significantly improving performance to 94.86%. By jointly modeling both static anatomical relationships and dynamic movement patterns, our approach learns comprehensive identity signatures that are more robust to spoofing than traditional appearance-based methods.</p></details> |  |

This eliminates the need for a synchronisation clock and minimises power consumption when no data is present. However, many benchmarks for neuromorphic algorithms primarily focus on spatial features, neglecting the temporal dynamics that are inherent to most sequence-based tasks. This gap may lead to evaluations that fail to fully capture the unique strengths and characteristics of neuromorphic systems. In this paper, we present NeuroMorse, a temporally structured dataset designed for benchmarking neuromorphic learning systems. NeuroMorse converts the top 50 words in the English language into temporal Morse code spike sequences. Despite using only two input spike channels for Morse dots and dashes, complex information is encoded through temporal patterns in the data. The proposed benchmark contains feature hierarchy at multiple temporal scales that test the capacity of neuromorphic algorithms to decompose input patterns into spatial and temporal hierarchies. We demonstrate that our training set is challenging to categorise using a linear classifier and that identifying keywords in the test set is difficult using conventional methods. The NeuroMorse dataset is available at Zenodo, with our accompanying code on GitHub at https://github.com/Ben-E-Walters/NeuroMorse.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Wasserstein Imputation: Versatile Missing Data Imputation for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02811v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing data can significantly hamper standard time series analysis, yet in practice they are frequently encountered. In this paper, we introduce temporal Wasserstein imputation, a novel method for imputing missing data in time series. Unlike existing techniques, our approach is fully nonparametric, circumventing the need for model specification prior to imputation, making it suitable for potential nonlinear dynamics. Its principled algorithmic implementation can seamlessly handle univariate or multivariate time series with any non-systematic missing pattern. In addition, the plausible range and side information of the missing entries (such as box constraints) can easily be incorporated. As a key advantage, our method mitigates the distributional bias typical of many existing approaches, ensuring more reliable downstream statistical analysis using the imputed series. Leveraging the benign landscape of the optimization formulation, we establish the convergence of an alternating minimization algorithm to critical points. We also provide conditions under which the marginal distributions of the underlying time series can be identified. Numerical experiments, including extensive simulations covering linear and nonlinear time series models and a real-world groundwater dataset laden with missing values, corroborate the practical usefulness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[STPro: Spatial and Temporal Progressive Learning for Weakly Supervised Spatio-Temporal Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20678v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work we study Weakly Supervised Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (WSTVG), a challenging task of localizing subjects spatio-temporally in videos using only textual queries and no bounding box supervision. Inspired by recent advances in vision-language foundation models, we investigate their utility for WSTVG, leveraging their zero-shot grounding capabilities. However, we find that a simple adaptation lacks essential spatio-temporal grounding abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce Tubelet Referral Grounding (TRG), which connects textual queries to tubelets to enable spatio-temporal predictions. Despite its promise, TRG struggles with compositional action understanding and dense scene scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose STPro, a novel progressive learning framework with two key modules: (1) Sub-Action Temporal Curriculum Learning (SA-TCL), which incrementally builds compositional action understanding, and (2) Congestion-Guided Spatial Curriculum Learning (CG-SCL), which adapts the model to complex scenes by spatially increasing task difficulty. STPro achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets, with improvements of 1.0% on VidSTG-Declarative and 3.0% on HCSTVG-v1.</p></details> | CVPR'25 Conference |

Prior efforts have focused on better alignment of image and text representations to enhance image understanding. However, though explicit reference to a prior image is common in Chest X-Ray (CXR) reports, aligning progression descriptions with the semantics differences in image pairs remains under-explored. In this work, we propose two components to address this issue. (1) A CXR report processing pipeline to extract temporal structure. It processes reports with a large language model (LLM) to separate the description and comparison contexts, and extracts fine-grained annotations from reports. (2) A contrastive captioner model for CXR, namely CoCa-CXR, to learn how to both describe images and their temporal progressions. CoCa-CXR incorporates a novel regional cross-attention module to identify local differences between paired CXR images. Extensive experiments show the superiority of CoCa-CXR on both progression analysis and report generation compared to previous methods. Notably, on MS-CXR-T progression classification, CoCa-CXR obtains 65.0% average testing accuracy on five pulmonary conditions, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) model BioViL-T by 4.8%. It also achieves a RadGraph F1 of 24.2% on MIMIC-CXR, which is comparable to the Med-Gemini foundation model.</p></details> |  |
| **[TripCraft: A Benchmark for Spatio-Temporally Fine Grained Travel Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20508v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in probing Large Language Models (LLMs) have explored their latent potential as personalized travel planning agents, yet existing benchmarks remain limited in real world applicability. Existing datasets, such as TravelPlanner and TravelPlanner+, suffer from semi synthetic data reliance, spatial inconsistencies, and a lack of key travel constraints, making them inadequate for practical itinerary generation. To address these gaps, we introduce TripCraft, a spatiotemporally coherent travel planning dataset that integrates real world constraints, including public transit schedules, event availability, diverse attraction categories, and user personas for enhanced personalization. To evaluate LLM generated plans beyond existing binary validation methods, we propose five continuous evaluation metrics, namely Temporal Meal Score, Temporal Attraction Score, Spatial Score, Ordering Score, and Persona Score which assess itinerary quality across multiple dimensions. Our parameter informed setting significantly enhances meal scheduling, improving the Temporal Meal Score from 61% to 80% in a 7 day scenario. TripCraft establishes a new benchmark for LLM driven personalized travel planning, offering a more realistic, constraint aware framework for itinerary generation. Dataset and Codebase will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 18 Tables and 6 Figures</p></details> |

Although this field has achieved remarkable progress in recent years, further progress and real-world applications are impeded by the absence of a standardized framework. Currently, different methods are compared under different implementation settings, evaluation protocols, etc., making it difficult to assess the real effectiveness of a specific technique. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{OpenTAD}, a unified TAD framework consolidating 16 different TAD methods and 9 standard datasets into a modular codebase. In OpenTAD, minimal effort is required to replace one module with a different design, train a feature-based TAD model in end-to-end mode, or switch between the two. OpenTAD also facilitates straightforward benchmarking across various datasets and enables fair and in-depth comparisons among different methods. With OpenTAD, we comprehensively study how innovations in different network components affect detection performance and identify the most effective design choices through extensive experiments. This study has led to a new state-of-the-art TAD method built upon existing techniques for each component. We have made our code and models available at https://github.com/sming256/OpenTAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding the Limits of Deep Tabular Methods with Temporal Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20260v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep tabular models have demonstrated remarkable success on i.i.d. data, excelling in a variety of structured data tasks. However, their performance often deteriorates under temporal distribution shifts, where trends and periodic patterns are present in the evolving data distribution over time. In this paper, we explore the underlying reasons for this failure in capturing temporal dependencies. We begin by investigating the training protocol, revealing a key issue in how model selection perform. While existing approaches use temporal ordering for splitting validation set, we show that even a random split can significantly improve model performance. By minimizing the time lag between training data and test time, while reducing the bias in validation, our proposed training protocol significantly improves generalization across various methods. Furthermore, we analyze how temporal data affects deep tabular representations, uncovering that these models often fail to capture crucial periodic and trend information. To address this gap, we introduce a plug-and-play temporal embedding method based on Fourier series expansion to learn and incorporate temporal patterns, offering an adaptive approach to handle temporal shifts. Our experiments demonstrate that this temporal embedding, combined with the improved training protocol, provides a more effective and robust framework for learning from temporal tabular data.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

Intuitively, these modalities allow to express that, from agent $a$'s standpoint, it is conceivable that a given formula holds. Besides the standard interpretation of the standpoint modalities we introduce four new semantics, which differ in the information an agent can extract from the history. We provide a general model checking algorithm applicable to $SLTL$ under any of the five semantics. Furthermore we analyze the computational complexity of the corresponding model checking problems, obtaining PSPACE-completeness in three cases, which stands in contrast to the known EXPSPACE-completeness of the $SLTL$ satisfiability problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[STUPD: A Synthetic Dataset for Spatial and Temporal Relation Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06680v3)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding relations between objects is crucial for understanding the semantics of a visual scene. It is also an essential step in order to bridge visual and language models. However, current state-of-the-art computer vision models still lack the ability to perform spatial reasoning well. Existing datasets mostly cover a relatively small number of spatial relations, all of which are static relations that do not intrinsically involve motion. In this paper, we propose the Spatial and Temporal Understanding of Prepositions Dataset (STUPD) -- a large-scale video dataset for understanding static and dynamic spatial relationships derived from prepositions of the English language. The dataset contains 150K visual depictions (videos and images), consisting of 30 distinct spatial prepositional senses, in the form of object interaction simulations generated synthetically using Unity3D. In addition to spatial relations, we also propose 50K visual depictions across 10 temporal relations, consisting of videos depicting event/time-point interactions. To our knowledge, no dataset exists that represents temporal relations through visual settings. In this dataset, we also provide 3D information about object interactions such as frame-wise coordinates, and descriptions of the objects used. The goal of this synthetic dataset is to help models perform better in visual relationship detection in real-world settings. We demonstrate an increase in the performance of various models over 2 real-world datasets (ImageNet-VidVRD and Spatial Senses) when pretrained on the STUPD dataset, in comparison to other pretraining datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Oryx MLLM: On-Demand Spatial-Temporal Understanding at Arbitrary Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12961v4)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual data comes in various forms, ranging from small icons of just a few pixels to long videos spanning hours. Existing multi-modal LLMs usually standardize these diverse visual inputs to a fixed resolution for visual encoders and yield similar numbers of tokens for LLMs. This approach is non-optimal for multimodal understanding and inefficient for processing inputs with long and short visual contents. To solve the problem, we propose Oryx, a unified multimodal architecture for the spatial-temporal understanding of images, videos, and multi-view 3D scenes. Oryx offers an on-demand solution to seamlessly and efficiently process visual inputs with arbitrary spatial sizes and temporal lengths through two core innovations: 1) a pre-trained OryxViT model that can encode images at any resolution into LLM-friendly visual representations; 2) a dynamic compressor module that supports 1x to 16x compression on visual tokens by request. These design features enable Oryx to accommodate extremely long visual contexts, such as videos, with lower resolution and high compression while maintaining high recognition precision for tasks like document understanding with native resolution and no compression. Beyond the architectural improvements, enhanced data curation and specialized training on long-context retrieval and spatial-aware data help Oryx achieve strong capabilities in image, video, and 3D multimodal understanding simultaneously. Our work is open-sourced at https://github.com/Oryx-mllm/Oryx.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Stroke predominantly affects older adults, with 75% of cases occurring in individuals aged 65 and older, underscoring the urgent need for tailored rehabilitation strategies in aging populations. Despite the critical role therapists play in evaluating rehabilitation progress and ensuring the effectiveness of treatment, current assessment methods can often be subjective, inconsistent, and time-consuming, leading to delays in adjusting therapy protocols. This study aims to address these challenges by providing a solution for consistent and timely analysis. Specifically, we perform temporal segmentation of video recordings to capture detailed activities during stroke patients' rehabilitation. The main application scenario motivating this study is the clinical assessment of daily tabletop object interactions, which are crucial for post-stroke physical rehabilitation. To achieve this, we present a framework that leverages the biomechanics of movement during therapy sessions. Our solution divides the process into two main tasks: 2D keypoint detection to track patients' physical movements, and 1D time-series temporal segmentation to analyze these movements over time. This dual approach enables automated labeling with only a limited set of real-world data, addressing the challenges of variability in patient movements and limited dataset availability. By tackling these issues, our method shows strong potential for practical deployment in physical therapy settings, enhancing the speed and accuracy of rehabilitation assessments.</p></details> |  |

However, designing an effective 4D backbone remains challenging, mainly due to the irregular and unordered distribution of points and temporal inconsistencies across frames. Also, recent transformer-based 4D backbones commonly suffer from large computational costs due to their quadratic complexity, particularly for long video sequences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel point cloud video understanding backbone purely based on the State Space Models (SSMs). Specifically, we first disentangle space and time in 4D video sequences and then establish the spatio-temporal correlation with our designed Mamba blocks. The Intra-frame Spatial Mamba module is developed to encode locally similar geometric structures within a certain temporal stride. Subsequently, locally correlated tokens are delivered to the Inter-frame Temporal Mamba module, which integrates long-term point features across the entire video with linear complexity. Our proposed Mamba4d achieves competitive performance on the MSR-Action3D action recognition (+10.4% accuracy), HOI4D action segmentation (+0.7 F1 Score), and Synthia4D semantic segmentation (+0.19 mIoU) datasets. Especially, for long video sequences, our method has a significant efficiency improvement with 87.5% GPU memory reduction and 5.36 times speed-up.

Recently, advanced multi-modal methods incorporating camera information have achieved notable performance. For a safe and effective autonomous driving system, algorithms that excel not only in accuracy but also in speed and low latency are essential. However, existing algorithms fail to meet these requirements due to the latency and bandwidth limitations of fixed frame rate sensors, e.g., LiDAR and camera. To address this limitation, we introduce asynchronous event cameras into 3D object detection for the first time. We leverage their high temporal resolution and low bandwidth to enable high-speed 3D object detection. Our method enables detection even during inter-frame intervals when synchronized data is unavailable, by retrieving previous 3D information through the event camera. Furthermore, we introduce the first event-based 3D object detection dataset, DSEC-3DOD, which includes ground-truth 3D bounding boxes at 100 FPS, establishing the first benchmark for event-based 3D detectors. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/mickeykang16/Ev3DOD.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |

The objective is to enable the robotic systems to optimally fulfill high-level tasks specified by Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas. To capture both types of uncertainty in a unified modelling framework, we utilise Markov Decision Processes with Set-valued Transitions (MDPSTs). We introduce a novel solution technique for the optimal robust strategy synthesis of MDPSTs with LTL specifications. To improve efficiency, our work leverages limit-deterministic B\"uchi automata (LDBAs) as the automaton representation for LTL to take advantage of their efficient constructions. To tackle the inherent nondeterminism in MDPSTs, which presents a significant challenge for reducing the LTL planning problem to a reachability problem, we introduce the concept of a Winning Region (WR) for MDPSTs. Additionally, we propose an algorithm for computing the WR over the product of the MDPST and the LDBA. Finally, a robust value iteration algorithm is invoked to solve the reachability problem. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through a case study involving a mobile robot operating in the hexagonal world, demonstrating promising efficiency gains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of an accepted ICRA 2025 paper</p></details> |

Resting-state fMRI, a non-invasive tool for capturing brain connectivity patterns, aids in early ASD diagnosis and differentiation from typical controls (TC). However, previous methods, which rely on either mean time series or full 4D data, are limited by a lack of spatial information or by high computational costs. This underscores the need for an efficient solution that preserves both spatial and temporal information. In this paper, we propose a novel, simple, and efficient spatial-temporal-omics learning framework designed to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from fMRI for ASD classification. Our approach addresses these limitations by utilizing 3D time-domain derivatives as the spatial-temporal inter-voxel omics, which preserve full spatial resolution while capturing diverse statistical characteristics of the time series at each voxel. Meanwhile, functional connectivity features serve as the spatial-temporal inter-regional omics, capturing correlations across brain regions. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the ABIDE dataset demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms previous methods while maintaining computational efficiency. We believe our research offers valuable insights that will inform and advance future ASD studies, particularly in the realm of spatial-temporal-omics-based learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)</p></details> |

Frequently, such datasets include timestamps and could correspond to, for example, health-related measurements of subjects collected over time. The temporal dimension is inherently different from the other dimensions, requiring methods that account for its intrinsic properties. Linear Dynamical Systems (LDS) are specifically designed to capture sequential dependencies in the observed data. In this work, we bridge the gap between tensor factorizations and dynamical modeling by exploring the relationship between LDS, Coupled Matrix Factorizations (CMF) and the PARAFAC2 model. We propose a time-aware coupled factorization model called d(ynamical)CMF that constrains the temporal evolution of the latent factors to adhere to a specific LDS structure. Using synthetic datasets, we compare the performance of dCMF with PARAFAC2 and t(emporal)PARAFAC2 which incorporates temporal smoothness. Our results show that dCMF and PARAFAC2-based approaches perform similarly when capturing smoothly evolving patterns that adhere to the PARAFAC2 structure. However, dCMF outperforms alternatives when the patterns evolve smoothly but deviate from the PARAFAC2 structure. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed dCMF method enables to capture more complex dynamics when additional prior information about the temporal evolution is incorporated.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimating Nodal Spreading Influence Using Partial Temporal Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19350v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal networks, whose links are activated or deactivated over time, are used to represent complex systems such as social interactions or collaborations occurring at specific times. Such networks facilitate the spread of information and epidemics. The average number of nodes infected via a spreading process on a network starting from a single seed node over a given period is called the influence of that node. In this paper, we address the question of how to utilize the partially observed temporal network (local and of short duration) around each node, to estimate the ranking of nodes in spreading influence on the full network over a long period. This is essential for target marketing and epidemic/misinformation mitigation where only partial network information is possibly accessible. This would also enable us to understand which network properties of a node, observed locally and shortly after the start of the spreading process, determine its influence. We systematically propose a set of nodal centrality metrics based on partial temporal network information, encoding diverse properties of (time-respecting) walks. It is found that distinct centrality metrics perform the best in estimating nodal influence depending on the infection probability of the spreading process. For a broad range of the infection probability, a node tends to be influential if it can reach many distinct nodes via time-respecting walks and if these nodes can be reached early in time. We find and explain why the proposed metrics generally outperform classic centrality metrics derived from both full and partial temporal networks.</p></details> |  |

The system employs a two-phase generation of a robot-oriented knowledge base, ensuring reusability and compositional reasoning, as well as a three-step planning procedure that handles temporal dependencies, resource constraints, and parallel task execution via mixed-integer linear programming. The final plan is converted into a Behaviour Tree for direct use in ROS2. We tested the framework in multi-robot assembly tasks within a block world and an arch-building scenario. Results demonstrate that LLMs can produce accurate knowledge bases with modest human feedback, while Prolog guarantees formal correctness and explainability. This approach underscores the potential of LLM integration for advanced robotics tasks requiring flexible, scalable, and human-understandable planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latte++: Spatial-Temporal Voxel-based Test-Time Adaptation for Multi-Modal Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06461v4)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal test-time adaptation (MM-TTA) is proposed to adapt models to an unlabeled target domain by leveraging the complementary multi-modal inputs in an online manner. Previous MM-TTA methods for 3D segmentation rely on predictions of cross-modal information in each input frame, while they ignore the fact that predictions of geometric neighborhoods within consecutive frames are highly correlated, leading to unstable predictions across time. To fulfill this gap, we propose ReLiable Spatial-temporal Voxels (Latte), an MM-TTA method that leverages reliable cross-modal spatial-temporal correspondences for multi-modal 3D segmentation. Motivated by the fact that reliable predictions should be consistent with their spatial-temporal correspondences, Latte aggregates consecutive frames in a sliding-window manner and constructs Spatial-Temporal (ST) voxels to capture temporally local prediction consistency for each modality. After filtering out ST voxels with high ST entropy, Latte conducts cross-modal learning for each point and pixel by attending to those with reliable and consistent predictions among both spatial and temporal neighborhoods. Considering the prediction consistency might vary under different sliding windows, we further propose Latte++ which leverages ST voxels generated under various sliding windows to more thoroughly evaluate intra-modal prediction consistency before the cross-modal fusion. Experimental results show that both Latte and Latte++ achieve state-of-the-art performance on five MM-TTA benchmarks compared to previous MM-TTA or TTA methods. Code will be available at https://github.com/AronCao49/Latte-plusplus.</p></details> |  |

Empirical observations suggest that cross-attention outputs converge to a fixed point after several inference steps. The convergence time naturally divides the entire inference process into two phases: an initial phase for planning text-oriented visual semantics, which are then translated into images in a subsequent fidelity-improving phase. Cross-attention is essential in the initial phase but almost irrelevant thereafter. However, self-attention initially plays a minor role but becomes crucial in the second phase. These findings yield a simple and training-free method known as temporally gating the attention (TGATE), which efficiently generates images by caching and reusing attention outputs at scheduled time steps. Experimental results show when widely applied to various existing text-conditional diffusion models, TGATE accelerates these models by 10%-50%.

The results highlight the potential of combining spatial and temporal features for enhanced pain detection, offering a promising advancement in objective pain assessment methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables.

To address these limitations, this paper presents the Spatio-Temporal GraphFormer framework (STGFormer) for 3D human pose estimation in videos. First, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal criss-cross Graph (STG) attention mechanism, designed to more effectively leverage the inherent graph priors of the human body within continuous sequence distributions while capturing spatiotemporal long-range dependencies. Next, we present a dual-path Modulated Hop-wise Regular GCN (MHR-GCN) to independently process temporal and spatial dimensions in parallel, preserving features rich in temporal dynamics and the original or high-dimensional representations of spatial structures. Furthermore, the module leverages modulation to optimize parameter efficiency and incorporates spatiotemporal hop-wise skip connections to capture higher-order information. Finally, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPIINF-3DHP datasets.</p></details> |  |

Traditional verification approaches often fall short in terms of modularity and composability, which are essential for scalable and maintainable verification. We present a method for modular and compositional verification of concurrent programs using past-time temporal epistemic logic. Our approach builds on Halpern and Moses' epistemic logic framework and incorporates past-time temporal operators to capture the temporal context of thread interactions. We formalize the semantics of our logic, introduce a compositional proof system for reasoning about concurrent programs, and demonstrate its application. The expressiveness of our proposed logic provides a rigorous foundation to verify concurrent systems compositionally.</p></details> |  |

To address this, numerous temporal graph neural networks (temporal GNNs) and benchmark datasets have been developed. However, these datasets often feature excessive repeated edges and lack complex sequential dynamics, a key characteristic inherent in many real-world applications such as recommender systems and ``Who-To-Follow'' on social networks. This oversight has led existing methods to inadvertently downplay the importance of learning sequential dynamics, focusing primarily on predicting repeated edges. In this study, we demonstrate that existing methods, such as GraphMixer and DyGFormer, are inherently incapable of learning simple sequential dynamics, such as ``a user who has followed OpenAI and Anthropic is more likely to follow AI at Meta next.'' Motivated by this issue, we introduce the Temporal Graph Benchmark with Sequential Dynamics (TGB-Seq), a new benchmark carefully curated to minimize repeated edges, challenging models to learn sequential dynamics and generalize to unseen edges. TGB-Seq comprises large real-world datasets spanning diverse domains, including e-commerce interactions, movie ratings, business reviews, social networks, citation networks and web link networks. Benchmarking experiments reveal that current methods usually suffer significant performance degradation and incur substantial training costs on TGB-Seq, posing new challenges and opportunities for future research. TGB-Seq datasets, leaderboards, and example codes are available at https://tgb-seq.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, satellite-based remote sensing tools which are used for monitoring struggle to differentiate vegetation types in farms and orchards from forests. We observe that metrics such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), based on plant photosynthesis, have unique temporal signatures that reflect agricultural practices and seasonal cycles. We analyze yearly NDVI changes on 20 farms for 10 unique crops. Initial results show that NDVI curves are coherent with agricultural practices, are unique to each crop, consistent globally, and can differentiate farms from forests. We develop a novel longitudinal NDVI dataset for the state of California from 2020-2023 with 500~m resolution and over 70 million points. We use this to develop the TerraTrace platform, an end-to-end analytic tool that classifies land use using NDVI signatures and allows users to query the system through an LLM chatbot and graphical interface.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces the Hierarchical Federated Learning Transformer Network (H-FLTN) framework to address these challenges. H-FLTN employs a three-tier hierarchical architecture comprising EVs, community Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems (DERMS), and the Energy Provider Data Centre (EPDC) to enable accurate spatio-temporal predictions of EV charging needs while preserving privacy. Temporal prediction is enhanced using Transformer-based learning, capturing complex dependencies in charging behavior. Privacy is ensured through Secure Aggregation, Additive Secret Sharing, and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Sharing with Augmentation, which allow only secret shares of model weights to be exchanged while securing all transmissions. To improve training efficiency and resource management, H-FLTN integrates Dynamic Client Capping Mechanism (DCCM) and Client Rotation Management (CRM), ensuring that training remains both computationally and temporally efficient as the number of participating EVs increases. DCCM optimises client participation by limiting excessive computational loads, while CRM balances training contributions across epochs, preventing imbalanced participation. Our simulation results based on large-scale empirical vehicle mobility data reveal that DCCM and CRM reduce the training time complexity with increasing EVs from linear to constant. Its integration into real-world smart city infrastructure enhances energy demand forecasting, resource allocation, and grid stability, ensuring reliability and sustainability in future mobility ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 tables, 2 figures, Journal Paper</p></details> |

To mitigate these issue, we explore an off-policy based Temporal Difference Approximate Dynamic Programming approach that preserves contraction mapping when projecting the problem into a subspace of selected features, accounting for the probability distribution of the perturbed transition probability matrix. We further demonstrate how this Approximate Dynamic Programming approach can be implemented as a particular variant of the Temporal Difference learning algorithm, adapted for handling perturbations. To validate our theoretical findings, we provide a numerical example using a Markov Decision Process corresponding to a resource allocation problem.</p></details> |  |

Existing interpretation methods are limited by focusing mostly on classification tasks, evaluating using custom baseline models instead of the latest time series models, using simple synthetic datasets, and requiring training another model. We introduce a novel interpretation method, \textit{Windowed Temporal Saliency Rescaling (WinTSR)} addressing these limitations. WinTSR explicitly captures temporal dependencies among the past time steps and efficiently scales the feature importance with this time importance. We benchmark WinTSR against 10 recent interpretation techniques with 5 state-of-the-art deep-learning models of different architectures, including a time series foundation model. We use 3 real-world datasets for both time-series classification and regression. Our comprehensive analysis shows that WinTSR significantly outperforms other local interpretation methods in overall performance. Finally, we provide a novel, open-source framework to interpret the latest time series transformers and foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 14 figures, GitHub https://github.com/khairulislam/Timeseries-Explained</p></details> |

Exiting efforts focus on single-frame cooperative perception, however, how to capture the temporal cue between frames with V2X to facilitate the prediction task even the planning task is still underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the Co-MTP, a general cooperative trajectory prediction framework with multi-temporal fusion for autonomous driving, which leverages the V2X system to fully capture the interaction among agents in both history and future domains to benefit the planning. In the history domain, V2X can complement the incomplete history trajectory in single-vehicle perception, and we design a heterogeneous graph transformer to learn the fusion of the history feature from multiple agents and capture the history interaction. Moreover, the goal of prediction is to support future planning. Thus, in the future domain, V2X can provide the prediction results of surrounding objects, and we further extend the graph transformer to capture the future interaction among the ego planning and the other vehicles' intentions and obtain the final future scenario state under a certain planning action. We evaluate the Co-MTP framework on the real-world dataset V2X-Seq, and the results show that Co-MTP achieves state-of-the-art performance and that both history and future fusion can greatly benefit prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Recently, advancements in monitoring technology have facilitated the effective recording of nuclear radiation levels and related factors, such as weather conditions. The abundance of monitoring data enables the development of accurate and reliable nuclear radiation forecasting models, which play a crucial role in informing decision-making for individuals and governments. However, this task is challenging due to the imbalanced distribution of monitoring stations over a wide spatial range and the non-stationary radiation variation patterns. In this study, we introduce NRFormer, a novel framework tailored for the nationwide prediction of nuclear radiation variations. By integrating a non-stationary temporal attention module, an imbalance-aware spatial attention module, and a radiation propagation prompting module, NRFormer collectively captures complex spatio-temporal dynamics of nuclear radiation. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework against 11 baselines.</p></details> |  |

The objective is to provide a quality score to ensure correct performance and achieve desired results. To achieve this goal, a new graph-based model, the Dense Spatio-Temporal Graph Conv-GRU Network with Transformer, is introduced. This model combines a modified version of STGCN and transformer architectures for efficient handling of spatio-temporal data. The key idea is to consider skeleton data respecting its non-linear structure as a graph and detecting joints playing the main role in each rehabilitation exercise. Dense connections and GRU mechanisms are used to rapidly process large 3D skeleton inputs and effectively model temporal dynamics. The transformer encoder's attention mechanism focuses on relevant parts of the input sequence, making it useful for evaluating rehabilitation exercises. The evaluation of our proposed approach on the KIMORE and UI-PRMD datasets highlighted its potential, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational time. This resulted in faster and more accurate learning and assessment of rehabilitation exercises. Additionally, our model provides valuable feedback through qualitative illustrations, effectively highlighting the significance of joints in specific exercises.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, Computers in Biology and Medicine Journal</p></details> |

However, traditional approaches to assess patient actions often rely on manual observation and scoring, which are subjective and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an automated approach for patient action assessment using a Multi-Residual Spatio Temporal Graph Network (MR-STGN) that incorporates both angular and positional 3D skeletons. The MR-STGN is specifically designed to capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of patient actions. It achieves this by integrating information from multiple residual layers, with each layer extracting features at distinct levels of abstraction. Furthermore, we integrate an attention fusion mechanism into the network, which facilitates the adaptive weighting of various features. This empowers the model to concentrate on the most pertinent aspects of the patient's movements, offering precise instructions regarding specific body parts or movements that require attention. Ablation studies are conducted to analyze the impact of individual components within the proposed model. We evaluate our model on the UI-PRMD dataset demonstrating its performance in accurately predicting real-time patient action scores, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recurrent Neural Networks for Dynamic VWAP Execution: Adaptive Trading Strategies with Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18177v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The execution of Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) orders remains a critical challenge in modern financial markets, particularly as trading volumes and market complexity continue to increase. In my previous work arXiv:2502.13722, I introduced a novel deep learning approach that demonstrated significant improvements over traditional VWAP execution methods by directly optimizing the execution problem rather than relying on volume curve predictions. However, that model was static because it employed the fully linear approach described in arXiv:2410.21448, which is not designed for dynamic adjustment. This paper extends that foundation by developing a dynamic neural VWAP framework that adapts to evolving market conditions in real time. We introduce two key innovations: first, the integration of recurrent neural networks to capture complex temporal dependencies in market dynamics, and second, a sophisticated dynamic adjustment mechanism that continuously optimizes execution decisions based on market feedback. The empirical analysis, conducted across five major cryptocurrency markets, demonstrates that this dynamic approach achieves substantial improvements over both traditional methods and our previous static implementation, with execution performance gains of 10 to 15% in liquid markets and consistent outperformance across varying conditions. These results suggest that adaptive neural architectures can effectively address the challenges of modern VWAP execution while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for practical deployment.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a novel approach to occupancy estimation, termed GaussianFlowOcc, which is inspired by Gaussian Splatting and replaces traditional dense voxel grids with a sparse 3D Gaussian representation. Our efficient model architecture based on a Gaussian Transformer significantly reduces computational and memory requirements by eliminating the need for expensive 3D convolutions used with inefficient voxel-based representations that predominantly represent empty 3D spaces. GaussianFlowOcc effectively captures scene dynamics by estimating temporal flow for each Gaussian during the overall network training process, offering a straightforward solution to a complex problem that is often neglected by existing methods. Moreover, GaussianFlowOcc is designed for scalability, as it employs weak supervision and does not require costly dense 3D voxel annotations based on additional data (e.g., LiDAR). Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that GaussianFlowOcc significantly outperforms all previous methods for weakly supervised occupancy estimation on the nuScenes dataset while featuring an inference speed that is 50 times faster than current SOTA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transformers Can Learn Temporal Difference Methods for In-Context Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13861v4)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditionally, reinforcement learning (RL) agents learn to solve new tasks by updating their neural network parameters through interactions with the task environment. However, recent works demonstrate that some RL agents, after certain pretraining procedures, can learn to solve unseen new tasks without parameter updates, a phenomenon known as in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL). The empirical success of ICRL is widely attributed to the hypothesis that the forward pass of the pretrained agent neural network implements an RL algorithm. In this paper, we support this hypothesis by showing, both empirically and theoretically, that when a transformer is trained for policy evaluation tasks, it can discover and learn to implement temporal difference learning in its forward pass.</p></details> |  |

This study evaluates the efficacy of zero-shot LLMs in summarizing long clinical texts that require temporal reasoning, a critical aspect for comprehensively capturing patient histories and treatment trajectories. We applied a series of advanced zero-shot LLMs to extensive clinical documents, assessing their ability to integrate and accurately reflect temporal dynamics without prior task-specific training. While the models efficiently identified key temporal events, they struggled with chronological coherence over prolonged narratives. The evaluation, combining quantitative and qualitative methods, highlights the strengths and limitations of zero-shot LLMs in clinical text summarization. The results suggest that while promising, zero-shot LLMs require further refinement to effectively support clinical decision-making processes, underscoring the need for enhanced model training approaches that better capture the nuances of temporal information in long context medical documents.</p></details> |  |

Yet, the task of learning from abbreviated user interaction sequences poses a notable challenge. Data augmentation has been identified as a potent strategy to enhance the informational richness of these sequences. Traditional augmentation techniques, such as item randomization, may disrupt the inherent temporal dynamics. Although recent advancements in reverse chronological pseudo-item generation have shown promise, they can introduce temporal discrepancies when assessed in a natural chronological context. In response, we introduce a sophisticated approach, Bidirectional temporal data Augmentation with pre-training (BARec). Our approach leverages bidirectional temporal augmentation and knowledge-enhanced fine-tuning to synthesize authentic pseudo-prior items that retain user preferences and capture deeper item semantic correlations, thus boosting the model's expressive power. Our comprehensive experimental analysis on five benchmark datasets confirms the superiority of BARec across both short and elongated sequence contexts. Moreover, theoretical examination and case study offer further insight into the model's logical processes and interpretability.

However, maintaining its adaptability under diverse object properties and complex working conditions remains challenging. This article highlights the importance of completely representing spatio-temporal features of slip, and proposes a novel approach for incipient slip modeling and detection. Based on the analysis of localized displacement phenomenon, we establish the relationship between the characteristic strain rate extreme events and the local slip state. This approach enables the detection of both the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of stick-slip regions. Also, the proposed method can be applied to strain distribution sensing devices, such as vision-based tactile sensors. Simulations and prototype experiments validated the effectiveness of this approach under varying contact conditions, including different contact geometries, friction coefficients, and combined loads. Experiments demonstrated that this method not only accurately and reliably delineates incipient slip, but also facilitates friction parameter estimation and adaptive grasping control.</p></details> | 21 pages, 19 figures |

However, most approaches are based on the assumption of the availability of and accessibility to a sufficiently dense data source, which is rather the rare case in reality. Traffic sensors in road networks are generally highly sparse in their distribution: fleet-based traffic sensing is sparse in space but also sparse in time. There are also other traffic application, besides road traffic, like moving objects in the marine space, where observations are sparsely and arbitrarily distributed in space. In this paper, we tackle the problem of traffic prediction on sparse and spatially irregular and non-deterministic traffic observations. We draw a border between imputations and this work as we consider high sparsity rates and no fixed sensor locations. We advance correlation mining methods with a Sparse Unstructured Spatio Temporal Reconstruction (SUSTeR) framework that reconstructs traffic states from sparse non-stationary observations. For the prediction the framework creates a hidden context traffic state which is enriched in a residual fashion with each observation. Such an assimilated hidden traffic state can be used by existing traffic prediction methods to predict future traffic states. We query these states with query locations from the spatial domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted and presented at ACM SIGSPATIAL '23</p></details> |

To facilitate this line of research, in this work, we propose a new benchmark, termed $\textbf{P}$ath $\textbf{P}$lanning from $\textbf{N}$atural $\textbf{L}$anguage ($\textbf{PPNL}$). Our benchmark evaluates LLMs' spatial-temporal reasoning by formulating ''path planning'' tasks that require an LLM to navigate to target locations while avoiding obstacles and adhering to constraints. Leveraging this benchmark, we systematically investigate LLMs including GPT-4 via different few-shot prompting methodologies as well as BART and T5 of various sizes via fine-tuning. Our experimental results show the promise of few-shot GPT-4 in spatial reasoning, when it is prompted to reason and act interleavedly, although it still fails to perform long-term temporal reasoning. In contrast, while fine-tuned LLMs achieved impressive results on in-distribution reasoning tasks, they struggled to generalize to larger environments or environments with more obstacles.</p></details> |  |

However, existing whole-body-object interaction video benchmarks overlook the truth that open-world objects are diverse, that is, they usually provide limited and predefined object classes. Therefore, we introduce a new open-world benchmark: Grounding Interacted Objects (GIO) including 1,098 interacted objects class and 290K interacted object boxes annotation. Accordingly, an object grounding task is proposed expecting vision systems to discover interacted objects. Even though today's detectors and grounding methods have succeeded greatly, they perform unsatisfactorily in localizing diverse and rare objects in GIO. This profoundly reveals the limitations of current vision systems and poses a great challenge. Thus, we explore leveraging spatio-temporal cues to address object grounding and propose a 4D question-answering framework (4D-QA) to discover interacted objects from diverse videos.

HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, which meet the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges, such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STAD) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which are then used as conditional inputs to direct the reverse denoising process. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the STAD significantly enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STAD demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks, indicating their potential to substantially boost the spatial resolution of EEG.</p></details> |  |

Spectral-temporal graph neural network is a promising abstraction underlying most time series forecasting models that are based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, more is needed to know about the underpinnings of this branch of methods. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework that unravels the expressive power of spectral-temporal GNNs. Our results show that linear spectral-temporal GNNs are universal under mild assumptions, and their expressive power is bounded by our extended first-order Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm on discrete-time dynamic graphs. To make our findings useful in practice on valid instantiations, we discuss related constraints in detail and outline a theoretical blueprint for designing spatial and temporal modules in spectral domains. Building on these insights and to demonstrate how powerful spectral-temporal GNNs are based on our framework, we propose a simple instantiation named Temporal Graph Gegenbauer Convolution (TGGC), which significantly outperforms most existing models with only linear components and shows better model efficiency. Our findings pave the way for devising a broader array of provably expressive GNN-based models for time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 14 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

In order to simultaneously visualize more objects, in this paper, we propose to use video-to-video translation that mimics the development process of microscopic objects. In essence, we use a microscopy video-to-video translation framework namely Spatial-temporal Generative Adversarial Network (STGAN) to reveal the spatial and temporal relationships between the microscopic objects, after which a microscopy video of one object can be translated to another object in a different domain. The experimental results confirm that the proposed STGAN is effective in microscopy video-to-video translation that mitigates the spectral conflicts caused by the limited fluorescent labels, allowing multiple microscopic objects be simultaneously visualized.</p></details> |  |

By incorporating a risk indicator, the agent learns to favor actions with predictable consequences. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in several case studies and show its effectiveness in the presence of uncertainty. The results demonstrate that our method reduces the frequency of visits to risky states while preserving performance.

These scenarios, despite realistic, are often neglected in the literature, exposing these solutions to important performance degradation. In this work, we tackle this issue by introducing, for the first time, an approach for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) in sparse TAL, which we refer to as Semantic Adversarial unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SADA). Our contributions are threefold: (1) we pioneer the development of a domain adaptation model that operates on realistic sparse action detection benchmarks; (2) we tackle the limitations of global-distribution alignment techniques by introducing a novel adversarial loss that is sensitive to local class distributions, ensuring finer-grained adaptation; and (3) we present a novel set of benchmarks based on EpicKitchens100 and CharadesEgo, that evaluate multiple domain shifts in a comprehensive manner. Our experiments indicate that SADA improves the adaptation across domains when compared to fully supervised state-of-the-art and alternative UDA methods, attaining a performance boost of up to 6.14% mAP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Generative Approach to Credit Prediction with Learnable Prompts for Multi-scale Temporal Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13004v3)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent industrial credit scoring models remain heavily reliant on manually tuned statistical learning methods. While deep learning offers promising solutions, its effectiveness is often limited by the complexity of financial data, particularly in long-horizon scenarios. In this work, we propose FinLangNet, which addresses credit scoring by reframing it as the task of generating multi-scale distributions of a user's future behavior. Within this framework, tabular data is transformed into sequential representations, enabling the generation of user embeddings across multiple temporal scales. Inspired by the recent success of prompt-based training in Large Language Models (LLMs), FinLangNet also introduces two types of prompts to model and capture user behavior at both the feature-granularity and user-granularity levels. Experimental results demonstrate that FinLangNet outperforms the online XGBoost benchmark, achieving a 7.2\% improvement in KS metric performance and a 9.9\% reduction in the relative bad debt rate. Furthermore, FinLangNet exhibits superior performance on public UEA archives, underscoring its scalability and adaptability in time series classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Echo: A Large Language Model with Temporal Episodic Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16090v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on large language models (LLMs) has shown remarkable performance in domains such as mathematics, programming, and literary creation. However, most studies have focused on semantic memory-based question answering, neglecting LLMs' potential to handle episodic memory (EM)-related queries. This oversight has led to suboptimal performance in applications requiring EM, including emotional companionship, personal AI assistants, and AI teachers. To address this gap, we introduce Echo, a LLM enhanced with temporal episodic memory. We propose a Multi-Agent Data Generation Framework that guides the model in generating multi-turn, complex scenario episodic memory dialogue data (EM-Train). Temporal information is innovatively incorporated into the LLM training process, and Echo is trained using the EM-Train. Furthermore, We develop an EM-Test benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' episodic memory capabilities. The EM-Test assesses performance across various time spans and difficulty levels, providing a comprehensive evaluation of multi-turn episodic memory dialogues. Our experiments demonstrate that Echo significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs on EM-Test. Additionally, a qualitative analysis reveals Echo's potential to exhibit human-like episodic memory capabilities. We will open-source all datasets, code, and model weights.</p></details> |  |

With around 2000 ball events per game, their precise and exhaustive annotation based on a monocular video stream remains a tedious and costly manual task. While state-of-the-art spatio-temporal action detection methods show promise for automating this task, they lack contextual understanding of the game. Assuming professional players' behaviors are interdependent, we hypothesize that incorporating surrounding players' information such as positions, velocity and team membership can enhance purely visual predictions. We propose a spatio-temporal action detection approach that combines visual and game state information via Graph Neural Networks trained end-to-end with state-of-the-art 3D CNNs, demonstrating improved metrics through game state integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[LEAP: Enhancing Vision-Based Occupancy Networks with Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Correlation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15438v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-based occupancy networks provide an end-to-end solution for reconstructing the surrounding environment using semantic occupied voxels derived from multi-view images. This technique relies on effectively learning the correlation between pixel-level visual information and voxels. Despite recent advancements, occupancy results still suffer from limited accuracy due to occlusions and sparse visual cues. To address this, we propose a Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Correlation (LEAP)} method, which significantly enhances the performance of existing occupancy networks with minimal computational overhead. LEAP can be seamlessly integrated into various baseline networks, enabling a plug-and-play application. LEAP operates in three stages: 1) it tokenizes information from recent baseline and motion features into a shared, compact latent space; 2) it establishes full correlation through a tri-stream fusion architecture; 3) it generates occupancy results that strengthen the baseline's output. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method, outperforming the latest baseline models. The source code and several demos are available in the supplementary material.</p></details> |  |

How do these digital traces change in response to events happening in the real world? We leverage Reddit conversation data, exploiting its community-based structure, to elucidate how offline events influence online user interactions and behavior. Online conversations, as posts and comments, are analysed along their temporal and semantic dimensions. Conversations tend to become repetitive with a more limited vocabulary, develop at a faster pace, and feature heightened emotions. As the event approaches, the shifts occurring in conversations are reflected in the users' dynamics. Users become more active and they exchange information with a growing audience, despite using a less rich vocabulary and repetitive messages. The recurring patterns we discovered are persistent across a wide range of events and several contexts, representing a fingerprint of how online dynamics change in response to real-world occurrences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Misalignment in ANN-SNN Conversion and Its Mitigation via Probabilistic Spiking Neurons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14487v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a more energy-efficient alternative to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) by mimicking biological neural principles, establishing them as a promising approach to mitigate the increasing energy demands of large-scale neural models. However, fully harnessing the capabilities of SNNs remains challenging due to their discrete signal processing and temporal dynamics. ANN-SNN conversion has emerged as a practical approach, enabling SNNs to achieve competitive performance on complex machine learning tasks. In this work, we identify a phenomenon in the ANN-SNN conversion framework, termed temporal misalignment, in which random spike rearrangement across SNN layers leads to performance improvements. Based on this observation, we introduce biologically plausible two-phase probabilistic (TPP) spiking neurons, further enhancing the conversion process. We demonstrate the advantages of our proposed method both theoretically and empirically through comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100, CIFAR10-DVS, and ImageNet across a variety of architectures, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Fixed Variables: Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting via Flat Scheme and Spatio-temporal Focal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15296v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) has long been a key research focus. Traditionally, these studies assume a fixed number of variables, but in real-world applications, Cyber-Physical Systems often expand as new sensors are deployed, increasing variables in MTSF. In light of this, we introduce a novel task, Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting (EVTSF). This task presents unique challenges, specifically (1) handling inconsistent data shapes caused by adding new variables, and (2) addressing imbalanced spatio-temporal learning, where expanding variables have limited observed data due to the necessity for timely operation. To address these challenges, we propose STEV, a flexible spatio-temporal forecasting framework. STEV includes a new Flat Scheme to tackle the inconsistent data shape issue, which extends the graph-based spatio-temporal modeling architecture into 1D space by flattening the 2D samples along the variable dimension, making the model variable-scale-agnostic while still preserving dynamic spatial correlations through a holistic graph. We introduce a novel Spatio-temporal Focal Learning strategy that incorporates a negative filter to resolve potential conflicts between contrastive learning and graph representation, and a focal contrastive loss as its core to guide the framework to focus on optimizing the expanding variables. We benchmark EVTSF performance using three real-world datasets and compare it against three potential solutions employing SOTA MTSF models tailored for EVSTF. Experimental results show that STEV significantly outperforms its competitors, particularly on expanding variables. Notably, STEV, with only 5% of observations from the expanding period, is on par with SOTA MTSF models trained with complete observations. Further exploration of various expanding strategies underscores the generalizability of STEV in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graphon Particle Systems, Part I: Spatio-Temporal Approximation and Law of Large Numbers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16760v3)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a class of graphon particle systems with time-varying random coefficients. In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from the stochastic processes associated with the particle labels. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over a large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the limiting dynamics of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</p></details> |  |
| **[FLINT: Learning-based Flow Estimation and Temporal Interpolation for Scientific Ensemble Visualization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19178v2)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present FLINT (learning-based FLow estimation and temporal INTerpolation), a novel deep learning-based approach to estimate flow fields for 2D+time and 3D+time scientific ensemble data. FLINT can flexibly handle different types of scenarios with (1) a flow field being partially available for some members (e.g., omitted due to space constraints) or (2) no flow field being available at all (e.g., because it could not be acquired during an experiment). The design of our architecture allows to flexibly cater to both cases simply by adapting our modular loss functions, effectively treating the different scenarios as flow-supervised and flow-unsupervised problems, respectively (with respect to the presence or absence of ground-truth flow). To the best of our knowledge, FLINT is the first approach to perform flow estimation from scientific ensembles, generating a corresponding flow field for each discrete timestep, even in the absence of original flow information. Additionally, FLINT produces high-quality temporal interpolants between scalar fields. FLINT employs several neural blocks, each featuring several convolutional and deconvolutional layers. We demonstrate performance and accuracy for different usage scenarios with scientific ensembles from both simulations and experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[ZigzagNetVis: Suggesting temporal resolutions for graph visualization using zigzag persistence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03828v3)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal graphs are commonly used to represent complex systems and track the evolution of their constituents over time. Visualizing these graphs is crucial as it allows one to quickly identify anomalies, trends, patterns, and other properties that facilitate better decision-making. In this context, selecting an appropriate temporal resolution is essential for constructing and visually analyzing the layout. The choice of resolution is particularly important, especially when dealing with temporally sparse graphs. In such cases, changing the temporal resolution by grouping events (i.e., edges) from consecutive timestamps -- a technique known as timeslicing -- can aid in the analysis and reveal patterns that might not be discernible otherwise. However, selecting an appropriate temporal resolution is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose ZigzagNetVis, a methodology that suggests temporal resolutions potentially relevant for analyzing a given graph, i.e., resolutions that lead to substantial topological changes in the graph structure. ZigzagNetVis achieves this by leveraging zigzag persistent homology, a well-established technique from Topological Data Analysis (TDA). To improve visual graph analysis, ZigzagNetVis incorporates the colored barcode, a novel timeline-based visualization inspired by persistence barcodes commonly used in TDA. We also contribute with a web-based system prototype that implements suggestion methodology and visualization tools. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of ZigzagNetVis through a usage scenario, a user study with 27 participants, and a detailed quantitative evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This document contains the main article and supplementary material, similar to published version.

Compared with the traditional trajectory composed of a set of point-estimates obtained by a tracker in the measurement time-series, the trajectory that our series of studies including this paper pursued is given by a curve function of time (FoT). The trajectory FoT provides complete information of the movement of the target over time and can be used to infer the state corresponding to arbitrary time, not only at the measurement time. However, there are no metrics available for comparing and evaluating the trajectory FoT. To address this lacuna, we propose a metric denominated as the spatiotemporal-aligned trajectory integral distance (Star-ID). The StarID associates and aligns the estimated and actual trajectories in the spatio-temporal domain and distinguishes between the time-aligned and unaligned segments in calculating the spatial divergence including false alarm, miss-detection and localization errors. The effectiveness of the proposed distance metric and the time-averaged version is validated through theoretical analysis and numerical examples of a single target or multiple targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Part ...</summary><p>Part I of a series of companion papers; 11 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[A Stackelberg Game Approach for Signal Temporal Logic Control Synthesis with Uncontrollable Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14585v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the control synthesis problem for Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications in the presence of uncontrollable agents. Existing works mainly address this problem in a robust control setting by assuming the uncontrollable agents are adversarial and accounting for the worst-case scenario. While this approach ensures safety, it can be overly conservative in scenarios where uncontrollable agents have their own objectives that are not entirely opposed to the system's goals. Motivated by this limitation, we propose a new framework for STL control synthesis within the Stackelberg game setting. Specifically, we assume that the system controller, acting as the leader, first commits to a plan, after which the uncontrollable agents, acting as followers, take a best response based on the committed plan and their own objectives. Our goal is to synthesize a control sequence for the leader such that, for any rational followers producing a best response, the leader's STL task is guaranteed to be satisfied. We present an effective solution to this problem by transforming it into a single-stage optimization problem and leveraging counter-example guided synthesis techniques. We demonstrate that the proposed approach is sound and identify conditions under which it is optimal. Simulation results are also provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Temporal Connectivity Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14540v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Connectivity in temporal graphs relies on the notion of temporal paths, in which edges follow a chronological order (either strict or non-strict). In this work, we investigate the question of how to make a temporal graph connected. More precisely, we tackle the problem of finding, among a set of proposed temporal edges, the smallest subset such that its addition makes the graph temporally connected (TCA). We study the complexity of this problem and variants, under restricted lifespan of the graph, i.e. the maximum time step in the graph. Our main result on TCA is that for any fixed lifespan at least 2, it is NP-complete in both the strict and non-strict setting. We additionally provide a set of restrictions in the non-strict setting which makes the problem solvable in polynomial time and design an algorithm achieving this complexity. Interestingly, we prove that the source variant (making a given vertex a source in the augmented graph) is as difficult as TCA. On the opposite, we prove that the version where a list of connectivity demands has to be satisfied is solvable in polynomial time, when the size of the list is fixed. Finally, we highlight a variant of the previous case for which even with two pairs the problem is already NP-hard.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Temporal 3D Semantic Scene Completion via Optical Flow Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14520v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) provides comprehensive scene geometry and semantics for autonomous driving perception, which is crucial for enabling accurate and reliable decision-making. However, existing SSC methods are limited to capturing sparse information from the current frame or naively stacking multi-frame temporal features, thereby failing to acquire effective scene context. These approaches ignore critical motion dynamics and struggle to achieve temporal consistency. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel temporal SSC method FlowScene: Learning Temporal 3D Semantic Scene Completion via Optical Flow Guidance. By leveraging optical flow, FlowScene can integrate motion, different viewpoints, occlusions, and other contextual cues, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of 3D scene completion. Specifically, our framework introduces two key components: (1) a Flow-Guided Temporal Aggregation module that aligns and aggregates temporal features using optical flow, capturing motion-aware context and deformable structures; and (2) an Occlusion-Guided Voxel Refinement module that injects occlusion masks and temporally aggregated features into 3D voxel space, adaptively refining voxel representations for explicit geometric modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowScene achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) sequences, recognized as the gold standard for diagnosing CVDs, can clearly visualize the dynamic flow and reveal pathological conditions within the cerebrovasculature. Therefore, precise segmentation of cerebral arteries (CAs) and classification between their main trunks and branches are crucial for physicians to accurately quantify diseases. However, achieving accurate CA segmentation in DSA sequences remains a challenging task due to small vessels with low contrast, and ambiguity between vessels and residual skull structures. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets limits exploration in the field. In this paper, we introduce a DSA Sequence-based Cerebral Artery segmentation dataset (DSCA), the publicly accessible dataset designed specifically for pixel-level semantic segmentation of CAs. Additionally, we propose DSANet, a spatio-temporal network for CA segmentation in DSA sequences. Unlike existing DSA segmentation methods that focus only on a single frame, the proposed DSANet introduces a separate temporal encoding branch to capture dynamic vessel details across multiple frames. To enhance small vessel segmentation and improve vessel connectivity, we design a novel TemporalFormer module to capture global context and correlations among sequential frames. Furthermore, we develop a Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) module to effectively integrate spatial and temporal features from the encoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSANet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in CA segmentation, achieving a Dice of 0.9033.</p></details> | Published by TMI |

Despite its advantages, DPO suffers from a length bias, generating responses longer than those from the reference model. Existing solutions like SimPO and SamPO address this issue but uniformly treat the contribution of rewards across sequences, overlooking temporal dynamics. To this end, we propose an enhanced preference optimization method that incorporates a temporal decay factor controlled by a gamma parameter. This dynamic weighting mechanism adjusts the influence of each reward based on its position in the sequence, prioritizing earlier tokens that are more critical for alignment. By adaptively focusing on more relevant feedback, our approach mitigates overfitting to less pertinent data and remains responsive to evolving human preferences. Experimental results on several benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms vanilla DPO by 5.9-8.8 points on AlpacaEval 2 and 3.3-9.7 points on Arena-Hard across different model architectures and sizes. Furthermore, additional experiments on mathematical and reasoning benchmarks (MMLU, GSM8K, and MATH) confirm that our method enhances performance without compromising general capabilities.

However, most existing methods are limited to highway or highly simplified intersection scenarios due to the intricacy and diversity of traffic scenarios. In response, we propose Traffic Scenario Logic (TSL), which is a spatial-temporal logic designed for modeling and reasoning of urban pedestrian-free traffic scenarios. TSL provides a formal representation of the urban road network that can be derived from OpenDRIVE, i.e., the de facto industry standard of high-definition maps for autonomous driving, enabling the representation of a broad range of traffic scenarios without discretization approximations. We implemented the reasoning of TSL using Telingo, i.e., a solver for temporal programs based on Answer Set Programming, and tested it on different urban road layouts. Demonstrations show the effectiveness of TSL in test scenario generation and its potential value in areas like decision-making and control verification of autonomous driving.

Temporal Heads: Where Language Models Recall Time-specific Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14258v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the ability of language models to elicit facts has been widely investigated, how they handle temporally changing facts remains underexplored. We discover Temporal Heads, specific attention heads primarily responsible for processing temporal knowledge through circuit analysis. We confirm that these heads are present across multiple models, though their specific locations may vary, and their responses differ depending on the type of knowledge and its corresponding years. Disabling these heads degrades the model's ability to recall time-specific knowledge while maintaining its general capabilities without compromising time-invariant and question-answering performances. Moreover, the heads are activated not only numeric conditions ("In 2004") but also textual aliases ("In the year ..."), indicating that they encode a temporal dimension beyond simple numerical representation. Furthermore, we expand the potential of our findings by demonstrating how temporal knowledge can be edited by adjusting the values of these heads.</p></details> |  |

However, current deep learning methods face challenges: 1) postfusion techniques ignore the varying contributions of different modalities; 2) unprocessed sleep data can interfere with frequency-domain information. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a gated multimodal temporal neural network for multidomain sleep data, including heart rate, motion, steps, EEG (Fpz-Cz, Pz-Oz), and EOG from WristHR-Motion-Sleep and SleepEDF-78. The model integrates: 1) a pre-processing module for feature alignment, missing value handling, and EEG de-trending; 2) a feature extraction module for complex sleep features in the time dimension; and 3) a dynamic fusion module for real-time modality weighting.Experiments show classification accuracies of 85.03% on SleepEDF-78 and 94.54% on WristHR-Motion-Sleep datasets.

| **[A Unifying Approach to Product Constructions for Quantitative Temporal Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10465v3)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic programs are a powerful and convenient approach to formalise distributions over system executions. A classical verification problem for probabilistic programs is temporal inference: to compute the likelihood that the execution traces satisfy a given temporal property. This paper presents a general framework for temporal inference, which applies to a rich variety of quantitative models including those that arise in the operational semantics of probabilistic and weighted programs. The key idea underlying our framework is that in a variety of existing approaches, the main construction that enables temporal inference is that of a product between the system of interest and the temporal property. We provide a unifying mathematical definition of product constructions, enabled by the realisation that 1) both systems and temporal properties can be modelled as coalgebras and 2) product constructions are distributive laws in this context. Our categorical framework leads us to our main contribution: a sufficient condition for correctness, which is precisely what enables to use the product construction for temporal inference. We show that our framework can be instantiated to naturally recover a number of disparate approaches from the literature including, e.g., partial expected rewards in Markov reward models, resource-sensitive reachability analysis, and weighted optimization problems. Further, we demonstrate a product of weighted programs and weighted temporal properties as a new instance to show the scalability of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>To Ap...</summary><p>To Appear in OOPSLA2025</p></details> |

However, existing approaches often produce overly conservative uncertainty intervals at individual spatial units and fail to properly capture uncertainties when aggregating predictions across different spatial scales. This paper presents a novel hierarchical spatio-temporal model based on the conformal prediction framework to address these challenges. Our approach generates circuit-level DER growth predictions and efficiently aggregates them to the substation level while maintaining statistical validity through a tailored non-conformity score. Applied to a decade of DER installation data from a local utility network, our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches, particularly in reducing prediction interval widths while maintaining coverage.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on single-image understanding, leaving the analysis of image sequences largely unexplored. To address this limitation, we introduce StripCipher, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate capabilities of LMMs to comprehend and reason over sequential images. StripCipher comprises a human-annotated dataset and three challenging subtasks: visual narrative comprehension, contextual frame prediction, and temporal narrative reordering. Our evaluation of $16$ state-of-the-art LMMs, including GPT-4o and Qwen2.5VL, reveals a significant performance gap compared to human capabilities, particularly in tasks that require reordering shuffled sequential images. For instance, GPT-4o achieves only 23.93% accuracy in the reordering subtask, which is 56.07% lower than human performance. Further quantitative analysis discuss several factors, such as input format of images, affecting the performance of LLMs in sequential understanding, underscoring the fundamental challenges that remain in the development of LMMs.</p></details> |  |

They primarily emphasize temporal sharing while overlooking spatial and spectral dimensions. We propose an adaptive, AI-driven spectrum-sharing framework within the O-RAN architecture, integrating discriminative and generative AI (GenAI) to forecast spectrum needs across multiple timescales and spatial granularities. A marketplace model, managed by an authorized spectrum broker, enables operators to trade spectrum dynamically, balancing static assignments with real-time trading. GenAI enhances traffic prediction, spectrum estimation, and allocation, optimizing utilization while reducing costs. This modular, flexible approach fosters operator collaboration, maximizing efficiency and revenue. A key research challenge is refining allocation granularity and spatio-temporal dynamics beyond existing models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Temporal Regime Structure Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01412v3)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding causal relationships in multivariate time series is essential for predicting and controlling dynamic systems in fields like economics, neuroscience, and climate science. However, existing causal discovery methods often assume stationarity, limiting their effectiveness when time series consist of sequential regimes, consecutive temporal segments with unknown boundaries and changing causal structures. In this work, we firstly introduce a framework to describe and model such time series. Then, we present CASTOR, a novel method that concurrently learns the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for each regime while determining the number of regimes and their sequential arrangement. CASTOR optimizes the data log-likelihood using an expectation-maximization algorithm, alternating between assigning regime indices (expectation step) and inferring causal relationships in each regime (maximization step). We establish the identifiability of the regimes and DAGs within our framework. Extensive experiments show that CASTOR consistently outperforms existing causal discovery models in detecting different regimes and learning their DAGs across various settings, including linear and nonlinear causal relationships, on both synthetic and real world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty quantification for Markov chains with application to temporal difference learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13822v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markov chains are fundamental to statistical machine learning, underpinning key methodologies such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and temporal difference (TD) learning in reinforcement learning (RL). Given their widespread use, it is crucial to establish rigorous probabilistic guarantees on their convergence, uncertainty, and stability. In this work, we develop novel, high-dimensional concentration inequalities and Berry-Esseen bounds for vector- and matrix-valued functions of Markov chains, addressing key limitations in existing theoretical tools for handling dependent data. We leverage these results to analyze the TD learning algorithm, a widely used method for policy evaluation in RL. Our analysis yields a sharp high-probability consistency guarantee that matches the asymptotic variance up to logarithmic factors. Furthermore, we establish a $O(T^{-\frac{1}{4}}\log T)$ distributional convergence rate for the Gaussian approximation of the TD estimator, measured in convex distance. These findings provide new insights into statistical inference for RL algorithms, bridging the gaps between classical stochastic approximation theory and modern reinforcement learning applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Audio-Visual Adversarial Vulnerability from Temporal and Modality Perspectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11858v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While audio-visual learning equips models with a richer understanding of the real world by leveraging multiple sensory modalities, this integration also introduces new vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the adversarial robustness of audio-visual models, considering both temporal and modality-specific vulnerabilities. We propose two powerful adversarial attacks: 1) a temporal invariance attack that exploits the inherent temporal redundancy across consecutive time segments and 2) a modality misalignment attack that introduces incongruence between the audio and visual modalities. These attacks are designed to thoroughly assess the robustness of audio-visual models against diverse threats. Furthermore, to defend against such attacks, we introduce a novel audio-visual adversarial training framework. This framework addresses key challenges in vanilla adversarial training by incorporating efficient adversarial perturbation crafting tailored to multi-modal data and an adversarial curriculum strategy. Extensive experiments in the Kinetics-Sounds dataset demonstrate that our proposed temporal and modality-based attacks in degrading model performance can achieve state-of-the-art performance, while our adversarial training defense largely improves the adversarial robustness as well as the adversarial training efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[On Qualitative Preference in Alternating-time Temporal Logic with Strategy Contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13436v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show how to add and eliminate binary preference on plays in Alternating-time Temporal Logic (ATL) with strategy contexts on Concurrent Game Models (CGMs) by means of a translation which preserves satisfaction in models where preference-indiscernibility between plays is an equivalence relation of finite index. The elimination technique also works for a companion second-order path quantifier, which makes quantified path variables range over sets of plays that are closed under preference-indiscernibility. We argue that the preference operator and the specialized quantifier facilitate formulating interesting solution concepts such as Nash equilibrium and secure equilibrium in a straightforward way. We also present a novel translation from ATL with strategy contexts to Quantified Computation Tree Logic (QCTL). Together with the translation which eliminates preference and the specialized form of quantification, this translation allows reasoning about infinite multiplayer synchronous games on CGMs to be translated from the proposed extension of ATL with strategy contexts into QCTL. The setting is related to that of ordered objectives in the works of Bouyer, Brenguier, Markey and Ummels, except that our focus is on the use of the temporal logic languages mentioned above, and we rely on translations into QCTL for the algorithmic solutions.</p></details> | 28 pages |

By utilizing multi-temporal ALS point clouds, semantic changes in urban area can be captured, demonstrating significant potential in urban planning, emergency management, and infrastructure maintenance. Existing 3D change detection methods struggle to efficiently extract multi-class semantic information and change features, still facing the following challenges: (1) the difficulty of accurately modeling cross-temporal point clouds spatial relationships for effective change feature extraction; (2) class imbalance of change samples which hinders distinguishability of semantic features; (3) the lack of real-world datasets for 3D semantic change detection. To resolve these challenges, we propose the Multi-task Enhanced Cross-temporal Point Transformer (ME-CPT) network. ME-CPT establishes spatiotemporal correspondences between point cloud across different epochs and employs attention mechanisms to jointly extract semantic change features, facilitating information exchange and change comparison. Additionally, we incorporate a semantic segmentation task and through the multi-task training strategy, further enhance the distinguishability of semantic features, reducing the impact of class imbalance in change types. Moreover, we release a 22.5 $km^2$ 3D semantic change detection dataset, offering diverse scenes for comprehensive evaluation. Experiments on multiple datasets show that the proposed MT-CPT achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. The source code and dataset will be released upon acceptance at https://github.com/zhangluqi0209/ME-CPT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting LLM Fact-conflicting Hallucinations Enhanced by Temporal-logic-based Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13416v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) face the challenge of hallucinations -- outputs that seem coherent but are actually incorrect. A particularly damaging type is fact-conflicting hallucination (FCH), where generated content contradicts established facts. Addressing FCH presents three main challenges: 1) Automatically constructing and maintaining large-scale benchmark datasets is difficult and resource-intensive; 2) Generating complex and efficient test cases that the LLM has not been trained on -- especially those involving intricate temporal features -- is challenging, yet crucial for eliciting hallucinations; and 3) Validating the reasoning behind LLM outputs is inherently difficult, particularly with complex logical relationships, as it requires transparency in the model's decision-making process. This paper presents Drowzee, an innovative end-to-end metamorphic testing framework that utilizes temporal logic to identify fact-conflicting hallucinations (FCH) in large language models (LLMs). Drowzee builds a comprehensive factual knowledge base by crawling sources like Wikipedia and uses automated temporal-logic reasoning to convert this knowledge into a large, extensible set of test cases with ground truth answers. LLMs are tested using these cases through template-based prompts, which require them to generate both answers and reasoning steps. To validate the reasoning, we propose two semantic-aware oracles that compare the semantic structure of LLM outputs to the ground truths. Across nine LLMs in nine different knowledge domains, experimental results show that Drowzee effectively identifies rates of non-temporal-related hallucinations ranging from 24.7% to 59.8%, and rates of temporal-related hallucinations ranging from 16.7% to 39.2%.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, under review. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2405.00648</p></details> |
| **[Mitigating Heterogeneity among Factor Tensors via Lie Group Manifolds for Tensor Decomposition Based Temporal Knowledge Graph Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09155v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have highlighted the effectiveness of tensor decomposition methods in the Temporal Knowledge Graphs Embedding (TKGE) task. However, we found that inherent heterogeneity among factor tensors in tensor decomposition significantly hinders the tensor fusion process and further limits the performance of link prediction. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel method that maps factor tensors onto a unified smooth Lie group manifold to make the distribution of factor tensors approximating homogeneous in tensor decomposition. We provide the theoretical proof of our motivation that homogeneous tensors are more effective than heterogeneous tensors in tensor fusion and approximating the target for tensor decomposition based TKGE methods. The proposed method can be directly integrated into existing tensor decomposition based TKGE methods without introducing extra parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in mitigating the heterogeneity and in enhancing the tensor decomposition based TKGE models.</p></details> |  |
| **[The influence of motion features in temporal perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13114v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines the role of manner-of-motion verbs in shaping subjective temporal perception and emotional resonance. Through four complementary studies, we explore how these verbs influence the conceptualization of time, examining their use in literal and metaphorical (temporal) contexts. Our findings reveal that faster verbs (e.g., fly, zoom) evoke dynamic and engaging temporal experiences, often linked to positive emotions and greater agency. In contrast, slower verbs (e.g., crawl, drag) convey passivity, monotony, and negative emotions, reflecting tedious or constrained experiences of time. These effects are amplified in metaphorical contexts, where manner verbs encode emotional and experiential nuances that transcend their literal meanings. We also find that participants prefer manner verbs over path verbs (e.g., go, pass) in emotionally charged temporal contexts, as manner verbs capture the experiential and emotional qualities of time more effectively. These findings highlight the interplay between language, motion, and emotion in shaping temporal perception, offering insights into how linguistic framing influences subjective experiences of time.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a solution for this problem using a novel drag-aware model formulation which is coupled with MPC, and therefore, enables tracking and landing during high-speed curvilinear trajectories of an USV without any communication. Compared to the state-of-the-art, our approach yields 40% decrease in prediction errors, and provides a 3-fold increase in certainty of predictions. Consequently, this leads to a 30% improvement in tracking performance and 40% higher success in landing on a moving USV even during aggressive turns that are unfeasible for conventional marine missions. We test our approach in two different real-world scenarios with marine vessels of two different sizes and further solidify our results through statistical analysis in simulation to demonstrate the robustness of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stochasticity in Motion: An Information-Theoretic Approach to Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01628v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving, accurate motion prediction is crucial for safe and efficient motion planning. To ensure safety, planners require reliable uncertainty estimates of the predicted behavior of surrounding agents, yet this aspect has received limited attention. In particular, decomposing uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic components is essential for distinguishing between inherent environmental randomness and model uncertainty, thereby enabling more robust and informed decision-making. This paper addresses the challenge of uncertainty modeling in trajectory prediction with a holistic approach that emphasizes uncertainty quantification, decomposition, and the impact of model composition. Our method, grounded in information theory, provides a theoretically principled way to measure uncertainty and decompose it into aleatoric and epistemic components. Unlike prior work, our approach is compatible with state-of-the-art motion predictors, allowing for broader applicability. We demonstrate its utility by conducting extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset, which shows how different architectures and configurations influence uncertainty quantification and model robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, submitted to International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> |

Supervised deep learning methods provide accurate road segmentation in the domain of their training data but cannot be trusted in out-of-distribution scenarios. Including the whole distribution in the trainset is challenging as each sample must be labeled by hand. Trajectory-based self-supervised methods offer a potential solution as they can learn from the traversed route without manual labels. However, existing trajectory-based methods use learning schemes that rely only on the camera or only on the lidar. In this paper, trajectory-based learning is implemented jointly with lidar and camera for increased performance. Our method outperforms recent standalone camera- and lidar-based methods when evaluated with a challenging winter driving dataset including countryside and suburb driving scenes.

Previous studies aim to predict gaze trajectories when humans are free-viewing an image, searching for required targets, or looking for clues to answer questions in an image. While these tasks focus on visual-centric scenarios, humans move their gaze also along with audio signal inputs in more common scenarios. To fill this gap, we introduce a new task that predicts human gaze trajectories in a visual scene with synchronized audio inputs and provide a new dataset containing 20k gaze points from 8 subjects. To effectively integrate audio information and simulate the dynamic process of human gaze motion, we propose a novel learning framework called EyEar (Eye moving while Ear listening) based on physics-informed dynamics, which considers three key factors to predict gazes: eye inherent motion tendency, vision salient attraction, and audio semantic attraction. We also propose a probability density score to overcome the high individual variability of gaze trajectories, thereby improving the stabilization of optimization and the reliability of the evaluation. Experimental results show that EyEar outperforms all the baselines in the context of all evaluation metrics, thanks to the proposed components in the learning model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-Driven Data Generation for Contact-Rich Manipulation via Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20382v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a low-cost data generation pipeline that integrates physics-based simulation, human demonstrations, and model-based planning to efficiently generate large-scale, high-quality datasets for contact-rich robotic manipulation tasks. Starting with a small number of embodiment-flexible human demonstrations collected in a virtual reality simulation environment, the pipeline refines these demonstrations using optimization-based kinematic retargeting and trajectory optimization to adapt them across various robot embodiments and physical parameters. This process yields a diverse, physically consistent dataset that enables cross-embodiment data transfer, and offers the potential to reuse legacy datasets collected under different hardware configurations or physical parameters. We validate the pipeline's effectiveness by training diffusion policies from the generated datasets for challenging contact-rich manipulation tasks across multiple robot embodiments, including a floating Allegro hand and bimanual robot arms. The trained policies are deployed zero-shot on hardware for bimanual iiwa arms, achieving high success rates with minimal human input.

This paper introduces the Trajectory-to-Action Pipeline (TAP), a scalable and automated method for extracting SDL labels from large trajectory datasets. TAP applies a rules-based cross-entropy optimization approach to learn parameters directly from data, enhancing generalization across diverse driving contexts. Using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), TAP achieves 30% greater precision than Average Displacement Error (ADE) and 24% over Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in identifying behaviorally similar trajectories. Additionally, TAP enables automated detection of unique driving behaviors, streamlining safety evaluation processes for AV testing. This work provides a foundation for scalable scenario-based AV behavior analysis, with potential extensions for integrating multi-agent contexts.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[T1-PILOT: Optimized Trajectories for T1 Mapping Acceleration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20333v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cardiac T1 mapping provides critical quantitative insights into myocardial tissue composition, enabling the assessment of pathologies such as fibrosis, inflammation, and edema. However, the inherently dynamic nature of the heart imposes strict limits on acquisition times, making high-resolution T1 mapping a persistent challenge. Compressed sensing (CS) approaches have reduced scan durations by undersampling k-space and reconstructing images from partial data, and recent studies show that jointly optimizing the undersampling patterns with the reconstruction network can substantially improve performance. Still, most current T1 mapping pipelines rely on static, hand-crafted masks that do not exploit the full acceleration and accuracy potential. In this work, we introduce T1-PILOT: an end-to-end method that explicitly incorporates the T1 signal relaxation model into the sampling-reconstruction framework to guide the learning of non-Cartesian trajectories, crossframe alignment, and T1 decay estimation. Through extensive experiments on the CMRxRecon dataset, T1-PILOT significantly outperforms several baseline strategies (including learned single-mask and fixed radial or golden-angle sampling schemes), achieving higher T1 map fidelity at greater acceleration factors. In particular, we observe consistent gains in PSNR and VIF relative to existing methods, along with marked improvements in delineating finer myocardial structures. Our results highlight that optimizing sampling trajectories in tandem with the physical relaxation model leads to both enhanced quantitative accuracy and reduced acquisition times. Code for reproducing all results will be made publicly available upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Minds on the Move: Decoding Trajectory Prediction in Autonomous Driving with Cognitive Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20084v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In mixed autonomous driving environments, accurately predicting the future trajectories of surrounding vehicles is crucial for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). In driving scenarios, a vehicle's trajectory is determined by the decision-making process of human drivers. However, existing models primarily focus on the inherent statistical patterns in the data, often neglecting the critical aspect of understanding the decision-making processes of human drivers. This oversight results in models that fail to capture the true intentions of human drivers, leading to suboptimal performance in long-term trajectory prediction. To address this limitation, we introduce a Cognitive-Informed Transformer (CITF) that incorporates a cognitive concept, Perceived Safety, to interpret drivers' decision-making mechanisms. Perceived Safety encapsulates the varying risk tolerances across drivers with different driving behaviors. Specifically, we develop a Perceived Safety-aware Module that includes a Quantitative Safety Assessment for measuring the subject risk levels within scenarios, and Driver Behavior Profiling for characterizing driver behaviors. Furthermore, we present a novel module, Leanformer, designed to capture social interactions among vehicles. CITF demonstrates significant performance improvements on three well-established datasets. In terms of long-term prediction, it surpasses existing benchmarks by 12.0% on the NGSIM, 28.2% on the HighD, and 20.8% on the MoCAD dataset. Additionally, its robustness in scenarios with limited or missing data is evident, surpassing most state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, and paving the way for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

While recent learning-based methods, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in specific scenarios, RL planners struggle with training inefficiencies and managing large-scale, real-world driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CarPlanner}, a \textbf{C}onsistent \textbf{a}uto-\textbf{r}egressive \textbf{Planner} that uses RL to generate multi-modal trajectories. The auto-regressive structure enables efficient large-scale RL training, while the incorporation of consistency ensures stable policy learning by maintaining coherent temporal consistency across time steps. Moreover, CarPlanner employs a generation-selection framework with an expert-guided reward function and an invariant-view module, simplifying RL training and enhancing policy performance. Extensive analysis demonstrates that our proposed RL framework effectively addresses the challenges of training efficiency and performance enhancement, positioning CarPlanner as a promising solution for trajectory planning in autonomous driving. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that the RL-based planner can surpass both IL- and rule-based state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) on the challenging large-scale real-world dataset nuPlan. Our proposed CarPlanner surpasses RL-, IL-, and rule-based SOTA approaches within this demanding dataset.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Tracailer: An Efficient Trajectory Planner for Tractor-Trailer Vehicles in Unstructured Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19832v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tractor-trailer vehicle (robot) consists of a drivable tractor and one or more non-drivable trailers connected via hitches. Compared to typical car-like robots, the addition of trailers provides greater transportation capability. However, this also complicates motion planning due to the robot's complex kinematics, high-dimensional state space, and deformable structure. To efficiently plan safe, time-optimal trajectories that adhere to the kinematic constraints of the robot and address the challenges posed by its unique features, this paper introduces a lightweight, compact, and high-order smooth trajectory representation for tractor-trailer robots. Based on it, we design an efficiently solvable spatio-temporal trajectory optimization problem. To deal with deformable structures, which leads to difficulties in collision avoidance, we fully leverage the collision-free regions of the environment, directly applying deformations to trajectories in continuous space. This approach not requires constructing safe regions from the environment using convex approximations through collision-free seed points before each optimization, avoiding the loss of the solution space, thus reducing the dependency of the optimization on initial values. Moreover, a multi-terminal fast path search algorithm is proposed to generate the initial values for optimization. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves several-fold improvements in efficiency compared to existing algorithms, while also ensuring lower curvature and trajectory duration. Real-world experiments involving the transportation, loading and unloading of goods in both indoor and outdoor scenarios further validate the effectiveness of our method.

In this paper, a large signal model of the grid-connected VSG is first established. The trajectory reversing method (TRM) is then introduced to estimate the domain of attraction (DOA) of VSG. Subsequently, the transient instability mechanism is revealed in detail based on the estimated DOA boundary. The impacts of system parameters on the DOA range are further investigated. It is found that loss of synchronization (LOS) occurs if the system trajectory lies outside the post-fault DOA range. In scenarios where no equilibrium points exist after a grid fault, system stability can be reestablished only when the fault clearing angle (FCA) does not exceed the critical clearing angle (CCA). Finally, the CCA derived from the DOA and that from the conventional equal area criteria (EAC) are compared. The results show that CCA obtained by our solution has a higher accuracy. Time-domain simulations are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed transient stability analysis method of grid-connected VSG.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,11 figures, references added</p></details> |

Reconstructing a point's 3D motion just from the images captured by only a monocular camera is unfeasible without prior assumptions. Under limited observation conditions such as insufficient observations, long distance, and high observation error of platform, the least squares estimation faces the issue of ill-conditioning. This paper presents an algorithm for reconstructing 3D trajectories of moving points using a monocular camera. The motion of the points is represented through temporal polynomials. Ridge estimation is introduced to mitigate the issues of ill-conditioning caused by limited observation conditions. Then, an automatic algorithm for determining the order of the temporal polynomials is proposed. Furthermore, the definition of reconstructability for temporal polynomials is proposed to describe the reconstruction accuracy quantitatively. The simulated and real-world experimental results demonstrate the feasibility, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

The conventional approaches typically focus on separate tasks such as trajectory prediction, imputation, or spatial-temporal recovery. Considering the unique formulation and constraint of each task, most existing methods are tailored for only one, limiting the ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, which is a common requirement in real-world scenarios. Another limitation is that widely used public datasets mainly focus on pedestrian movements with casual, loosely connected patterns, where interactions between individuals are not always present, especially at a long distance, making them less representative of more structured environments. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Unified Trajectory Generation model, UniTraj, that processes arbitrary trajectories as masked inputs, adaptable to diverse scenarios in the domain of sports games. Specifically, we introduce a Ghost Spatial Masking (GSM) module, embedded within a Transformer encoder, for spatial feature extraction. We further extend recent State Space Models (SSMs), known as the Mamba model, into a Bidirectional Temporal Mamba (BTM) to better capture temporal dependencies. Additionally, we incorporate a Bidirectional Temporal Scaled (BTS) module to thoroughly scan trajectories while preserving temporal missing relationships. Furthermore, we curate and benchmark three practical sports datasets, Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U, for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our model. We hope that our work can advance the understanding of human movement in real-world applications, particularly in sports.

Prior works addressed this challenging problem under a stochastic differential equation (SDE) model with a gradient-driven drift in the observed space, introducing a minimum entropy estimator relative to the Wiener measure and a practical grid-free mean-field Langevin (MFL) algorithm using Schr\"odinger bridges. Motivated by the success of observable state space models in the traditional paired trajectory inference problem (e.g. target tracking), we extend the above framework to a class of latent SDEs in the form of observable state space models. In this setting, we use partial observations to infer trajectories in the latent space under a specified dynamics model (e.g. the constant velocity/acceleration models from target tracking). We introduce the PO-MFL algorithm to solve this latent trajectory inference problem and provide theoretical guarantees to the partially observed setting. Experiments validate the robustness of our method and the exponential convergence of the MFL dynamics, and demonstrate significant outperformance over the latent-free baseline in key scenarios.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Due to the potentially long distance of the UAV's flight, frequent handovers may be incurred among different GBSs, which leads to various practical issues such as large delay and synchronization overhead. To address this problem, we investigate the trajectory optimization of the UAV to minimize the number of GBS handovers during the flight, subject to a communication quality constraint and a maximum mission completion time constraint. Although this problem is non-convex and difficult to solve, we derive useful structures of the optimal solution, based on which we propose an efficient algorithm based on graph theory and Lagrangian relaxation for finding a high-quality suboptimal solution in polynomial time. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed trajectory design.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in IEEE Wireless Communications Letters</p></details> |

Unlike competing-event models, the events here are not mutually exclusive and often exhibit statistical dependencies. Existing approaches for multi-event survival analysis have generally been limited, most focusing on producing simple risk scores for each event, rather than the time-to-event itself. To overcome these issues, we introduce MENSA, a novel deep learning approach for multi-event survival analysis. MENSA jointly learns representations of the input features while capturing the complex dependence structure among events. In practice, it attempts to optimize the sum of the traditional negative log-likelihood across events and a novel trajectory-based likelihood, which encourages the model to learn the temporal order in which events occur. Experiments on real-world clinical datasets show that MENSA consistently gives good discrimination performances and accurate time-to-event predictions in single-event, competing-risk, and multi-event problems. Additionally, MENSA is more computationally-efficient, requiring fewer parameters and FLOPs than multiple state-of-the-art survival baselines when applied to large-dimensional datasets (more than 100 features).</p></details> |  |

Such environments contain rich features like crosswalks, grass, and curbs, which are easily interpretable by humans, but not by mobile robots. We aim to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating on crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We develop a visual prompting approach and leverage the Visual Language Model's (VLM) zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our method in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe an average improvement of 20.81% in satisfying traversability constraints and 28.51% in terms of human-like navigation in four different outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, adjusting specific elements in generated videos, such as object motion or camera movement, is often a tedious process of trial and error, e.g., involving re-generating videos with different random seeds. Recent techniques address this issue by fine-tuning a pre-trained model to follow conditioning signals, such as bounding boxes or point trajectories. Yet, this fine-tuning procedure can be computationally expensive, and it requires datasets with annotated object motion, which can be difficult to procure. In this work, we introduce SG-I2V, a framework for controllable image-to-video generation that is self-guided$\unicode{x2013}$offering zero-shot control by relying solely on the knowledge present in a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model without the need for fine-tuning or external knowledge. Our zero-shot method outperforms unsupervised baselines while significantly narrowing down the performance gap with supervised models in terms of visual quality and motion fidelity.

Exiting efforts focus on single-frame cooperative perception, however, how to capture the temporal cue between frames with V2X to facilitate the prediction task even the planning task is still underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the Co-MTP, a general cooperative trajectory prediction framework with multi-temporal fusion for autonomous driving, which leverages the V2X system to fully capture the interaction among agents in both history and future domains to benefit the planning. In the history domain, V2X can complement the incomplete history trajectory in single-vehicle perception, and we design a heterogeneous graph transformer to learn the fusion of the history feature from multiple agents and capture the history interaction. Moreover, the goal of prediction is to support future planning. Thus, in the future domain, V2X can provide the prediction results of surrounding objects, and we further extend the graph transformer to capture the future interaction among the ego planning and the other vehicles' intentions and obtain the final future scenario state under a certain planning action. We evaluate the Co-MTP framework on the real-world dataset V2X-Seq, and the results show that Co-MTP achieves state-of-the-art performance and that both history and future fusion can greatly benefit prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, ICRA 2025</p></details> |

| **[Patient Trajectory Prediction: Integrating Clinical Notes with Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18009v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting disease trajectories from electronic health records (EHRs) is a complex task due to major challenges such as data non-stationarity, high granularity of medical codes, and integration of multimodal data. EHRs contain both structured data, such as diagnostic codes, and unstructured data, such as clinical notes, which hold essential information often overlooked. Current models, primarily based on structured data, struggle to capture the complete medical context of patients, resulting in a loss of valuable information. To address this issue, we propose an approach that integrates unstructured clinical notes into transformer-based deep learning models for sequential disease prediction. This integration enriches the representation of patients' medical histories, thereby improving the accuracy of diagnosis predictions. Experiments on MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional models relying solely on structured data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quadrotor Neural Dead Reckoning in Periodic Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17964v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real world scenarios, due to environmental or hardware constraints, the quadrotor is forced to navigate in pure inertial navigation mode while operating indoors or outdoors. To mitigate inertial drift, end-to-end neural network approaches combined with quadrotor periodic trajectories were suggested. There, the quadrotor distance is regressed and combined with inertial model-based heading estimation, the quadrotor position vector is estimated. To further enhance positioning performance, in this paper we propose a quadrotor neural dead reckoning approach for quadrotors flying on periodic trajectories. In this case, the inertial readings are fed into a simple and efficient network to directly estimate the quadrotor position vector. Our approach was evaluated on two different quadrotors, one operating indoors while the other outdoors. Our approach improves the positioning accuracy of other deep-learning approaches, achieving an average 27% reduction in error outdoors and an average 79% reduction indoors, while requiring only software modifications. With the improved positioning accuracy achieved by our method, the quadrotor can seamlessly perform its tasks.</p></details> |  |

The base transcription algorithm for which we establish the refinement algorithm is a direct multiple shooting technique -- $\mathsf{QuITO}$ $\textsf{v.2}$ (Quasi-Interpolation based Trajectory Optimization). The mesh refinement technique consists of two steps -- localization of certain irregular regions in an optimal control trajectory via wavelets, followed by a targeted $h$-refinement approach around such regions of irregularity. Theoretical approximation guarantees on uniform grids are presented for optimal controls with certain regularity properties, along with guarantees of localization of change points by wavelet transform. Numerical illustrations are provided for control profiles involving discontinuities to show the effectiveness of the localization and refinement strategy.

| **[Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Trajectory Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15429v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning safe behaviors without engaging in risky online interactions with the environment. Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[TraFlow: Trajectory Distillation on Pre-Trained Rectified Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16972v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Majorities of distillation methods on pre-trained diffusion models or on pre-trained rectified flow, focus on either the distillation outputs or the trajectories between random noises and clean images to speed up sample generations from pre-trained models. In those trajectory-based distillation methods, consistency distillation requires the self-consistent trajectory projection to regulate the trajectory, which might avoid the common ODE approximation error {while still be concerning about sampling efficiencies}. At the same time, rectified flow distillations enforce straight trajectory for fast sampling, although an ODE solver is still required. In this work, we propose a trajectory distillation method, \modelname, that enjoys the benefits of both and enables few-step generations. TraFlow adopts the settings of consistency trajectory models, and further enforces the properties of self-consistency and straightness throughout the entire trajectory. These two properties are pursued by reaching a balance with following three targets: (1) reconstruct the output from pre-trained models; (2) learn the amount of changes by pre-trained models; (3) satisfy the self-consistency over its trajectory. Extensive experimental results have shown the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Finite-Time Sliding Mode Control for Chattering-Free Trajectory Tracking of Robotic Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16867v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving precise and efficient trajectory tracking in robotic arms remains a key challenge due to system uncertainties and chattering effects in conventional sliding mode control (SMC). This paper presents a chattering-free fast terminal sliding mode control (FTSMC) strategy for a three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) robotic arm, designed to enhance tracking accuracy and robustness while ensuring finite-time convergence. The control framework is developed using Newton-Euler dynamics, followed by a state-space representation that captures the system's angular position and velocity. By incorporating an improved sliding surface and a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, the proposed FTSMC effectively mitigates chattering while preserving the advantages of SMC, such as fast response and strong disturbance rejection. The controller's performance is rigorously evaluated through comparisons with conventional PD sliding mode control (PDSMC) and terminal sliding mode control (TSMC). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior trajectory tracking performance, faster convergence, and enhanced stability compared to existing methods, making it a promising solution for high-precision robotic applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Characterizing Structured versus Unstructured Environments based on Pedestrians' and Vehicles' Motion Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16847v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory behaviours of pedestrians and vehicles operating close to each other can be different in unstructured compared to structured environments. These differences in the motion behaviour are valuable to be considered in the trajectory prediction algorithm of an autonomous vehicle. However, the available datasets on pedestrians' and vehicles' trajectories that are commonly used as benchmarks for trajectory prediction have not been classified based on the nature of their environment. On the other hand, the definitions provided for unstructured and structured environments are rather qualitative and hard to be used for justifying the type of a given environment. In this paper, we have compared different existing datasets based on a couple of extracted trajectory features, such as mean speed and trajectory variability. Through K-means clustering and generalized linear models, we propose more quantitative measures for distinguishing the two different types of environments. Our results show that features such as trajectory variability, stop fraction and density of pedestrians are different among the two environmental types and can be used to classify the existing datasets.</p></details> |  |

While recent research demonstrates the applicability of diffusion models to OOD detection, existing approaches are limited to Euclidean or latent image spaces. Our work extends OOD detection to trajectories in the Special Euclidean Group in 3D ($\mathbb{SE}(3)$), addressing a critical need in computer vision, robotics, and engineering applications that process object pose sequences in $\mathbb{SE}(3)$. We present $\textbf{D}$iffusion-based $\textbf{O}$ut-of-distribution detection on $\mathbb{SE}(3)$ ($\mathbf{DOSE3}$), a novel OOD framework that extends diffusion to a unified sample space of $\mathbb{SE}(3)$ pose sequences. Through extensive validation on multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate $\mathbf{DOSE3}$'s superior performance compared to state-of-the-art OOD detection frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention-based UAV Trajectory Optimization for Wireless Power Transfer-assisted IoT Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17517v1)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in Wireless Power Transfer (WPT)-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) systems face the following challenges: limited resources and suboptimal trajectory planning. Reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning schemes face issues of low search efficiency and learning instability when optimizing large-scale systems. To address these issues, we present an Attention-based UAV Trajectory Optimization (AUTO) framework based on the graph transformer, which consists of an Attention Trajectory Optimization Model (ATOM) and a Trajectory lEarNing Method based on Actor-critic (TENMA). In ATOM, a graph encoder is used to calculate the self-attention characteristics of all IoTDs, and a trajectory decoder is developed to optimize the number and trajectories of UAVs. TENMA then trains the ATOM using an improved Actor-Critic method, in which the real reward of the system is applied as the baseline to reduce variances in the critic network. This method is suitable for high-quality and large-scale multi-UAV trajectory planning. Finally, we develop numerous experiments, including a hardware experiment in the field case, to verify the feasibility and efficiency of the AUTO framework.</p></details> |  |

However, existing datasets often suffer from limited scale diversity and inaccurate annotations, hindering robust model development. This paper introduces UAVDB, a high-resolution UAV detection dataset constructed using Patch Intensity Convergence (PIC). This novel technique automatically generates high-fidelity bounding box annotations from UAV trajectory data~\cite{li2020reconstruction}, eliminating the need for manual labeling. UAVDB features single-class annotations with a fixed-camera setup and consists of RGB frames capturing UAVs across various scales, from large-scale UAVs to near-single-pixel representations, along with challenging backgrounds that pose difficulties for modern detectors. We first validate the accuracy and efficiency of PIC-generated bounding boxes by comparing Intersection over Union (IoU) performance and runtime against alternative annotation methods, demonstrating that PIC achieves higher annotation accuracy while being more efficient. Subsequently, we benchmark UAVDB using state-of-the-art (SOTA) YOLO-series detectors, establishing UAVDB as a valuable resource for advancing long-range and high-resolution UAV detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Different from the classical state space model, our series of studies, including this paper, model the collection of the target state as a stochastic process (SP) that is further decomposed into a deterministic part which represents the trend of the trajectory and a residual SP representing the residual fitting error. Subsequently, the tracking problem is formulated as a learning problem regarding the trajectory SP for which a key part is to estimate a trajectory FoT (T-FoT) best fitting the measurements in time series. For this purpose, we consider the polynomial T-FoT and address the regularized polynomial T-FoT optimization employing two distinct regularization strategies seeking trade-off between the accuracy and simplicity. One limits the order of the polynomial and then the best choice is determined by grid searching in a narrow, bounded range while the other adopts $\ell_0$ norm regularization for which the hybrid Newton solver is employed. Simulation results obtained in both single and multiple maneuvering target scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Part ...</summary><p>Part II of a series of companion papers; 11 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing PPO with Trajectory-Aware Hybrid Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15968v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proximal policy optimization (PPO) is one of the most popular state-of-the-art on-policy algorithms that has become a standard baseline in modern reinforcement learning with applications in numerous fields. Though it delivers stable performance with theoretical policy improvement guarantees, high variance, and high sample complexity still remain critical challenges in on-policy algorithms. To alleviate these issues, we propose Hybrid-Policy Proximal Policy Optimization (HP3O), which utilizes a trajectory replay buffer to make efficient use of trajectories generated by recent policies. Particularly, the buffer applies the "first in, first out" (FIFO) strategy so as to keep only the recent trajectories to attenuate the data distribution drift. A batch consisting of the trajectory with the best return and other randomly sampled ones from the buffer is used for updating the policy networks. The strategy helps the agent to improve its capability on top of the most recent best performance and in turn reduce variance empirically. We theoretically construct the policy improvement guarantees for the proposed algorithm. HP3O is validated and compared against several baseline algorithms using multiple continuous control environments. Our code is available here.</p></details> |  |

It is classified into pedestrian or heterogeneous trajectory prediction. The former exploits the relatively consistent behavior of pedestrians, but is limited in real-world scenarios with heterogeneous traffic agents such as cyclists and vehicles. The latter typically relies on extra class label information to distinguish the heterogeneous agents, but such labels are costly to annotate and cannot be generalized to represent different behaviors within the same class of agents. In this work, we introduce the behavioral pseudo-labels that effectively capture the behavior distributions of pedestrians and heterogeneous agents solely based on their motion features, significantly improving the accuracy of trajectory prediction. To implement the framework, we propose the Behavioral Pseudo-Label Informed Sparse Graph Convolution Network (BP-SGCN) that learns pseudo-labels and informs to a trajectory predictor. For optimization, we propose a cascaded training scheme, in which we first learn the pseudo-labels in an unsupervised manner, and then perform end-to-end fine-tuning on the labels in the direction of increasing the trajectory prediction accuracy. Experiments show that our pseudo-labels effectively model different behavior clusters and improve trajectory prediction. Our proposed BP-SGCN outperforms existing methods using both pedestrian (ETH/UCY, pedestrian-only SDD) and heterogeneous agent datasets (SDD, Argoverse 1).</p></details> |  |
| **[A View of the Certainty-Equivalence Method for PAC RL as an Application of the Trajectory Tree Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02652v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) enables an agent interacting with an unknown MDP $M$ to optimise its behaviour by observing transitions sampled from $M$. A natural entity that emerges in the agent's reasoning is $\widehat{M}$, the maximum likelihood estimate of $M$ based on the observed transitions. The well-known \textit{certainty-equivalence} method (CEM) dictates that the agent update its behaviour to $\widehat{\pi}$, which is an optimal policy for $\widehat{M}$. Not only is CEM intuitive, it has been shown to enjoy minimax-optimal sample complexity in some regions of the parameter space for PAC RL with a generative model~\citep{Agarwal2020GenModel}. A seemingly unrelated algorithm is the ``trajectory tree method'' (TTM)~\citep{Kearns+MN:1999}, originally developed for efficient decision-time planning in large POMDPs. This paper presents a theoretical investigation that stems from the surprising finding that CEM may indeed be viewed as an application of TTM. The qualitative benefits of this view are (1) new and simple proofs of sample complexity upper bounds for CEM, in fact under a (2) weaker assumption on the rewards than is prevalent in the current literature. Our analysis applies to both non-stationary and stationary MDPs. Quantitatively, we obtain (3) improvements in the sample-complexity upper bounds for CEM both for non-stationary and stationary MDPs, in the regime that the ``mistake probability'' $\delta$ is small. Additionally, we show (4) a lower bound on the sample complexity for finite-horizon MDPs, which establishes the minimax-optimality of our upper bound for non-stationary MDPs in the small-$\delta$ regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, excluding references and appendices.

Recently, two important approaches have gained recognition. While one leverages via-points to adapt skills locally by modulating demonstrated trajectories, another relies on so-called task-parameterized models that encode movements with respect to different coordinate systems, using a product of probabilities for generalization. While the former are well-suited to precise, local modulations, the latter aim at generalizing over large regions of the workspace and often involve multiple objects. Addressing the quality of generalization by leveraging both approaches simultaneously has received little attention. In this work, we propose an interactive imitation learning framework that simultaneously leverages local and global modulations of trajectory distributions. Building on the kernelized movement primitives (KMP) framework, we introduce novel mechanisms for skill modulation from direct human corrective feedback. Our approach particularly exploits the concept of via-points to incrementally and interactively 1) improve the model accuracy locally, 2) add new objects to the task during execution and 3) extend the skill into regions where demonstrations were not provided. We evaluate our method on a bearing ring-loading task using a torque-controlled, 7-DoF, DLR SARA robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L), 16 pages, 19 figures, 6 tables.

Giving constraints in natural language form has great potential for practical scenarios due to its flexible transfer capability and accessibility. Previous safe RL methods with natural language constraints typically need to design cost functions manually for each constraint, which requires domain expertise and lacks flexibility. In this paper, we harness the dual role of text in this task, using it not only to provide constraint but also as a training signal. We introduce the Trajectory-level Textual Constraints Translator (TTCT) to replace the manually designed cost function. Our empirical results demonstrate that TTCT effectively comprehends textual constraint and trajectory, and the policies trained by TTCT can achieve a lower violation rate than the standard cost function. Extra studies are conducted to demonstrate that the TTCT has zero-shot transfer capability to adapt to constraint-shift environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

This paper investigates the use of sequential deep learning models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformers, for real-time flock detection in multi-pedestrian trajectories. Our proposed approach consists of a two-stage process: first, a pre-trained binary classification model is used for pairwise trajectory classification, and second, the learned representations are applied to identify multi-agent flocks dynamically. We validate our method using real-world group movement datasets, demonstrating its robustness across varying sequence lengths and diverse movement patterns. Experimental results indicate that our model consistently detects pedestrian flocks with high accuracy and stability, even in dynamic and noisy environments. Furthermore, we extend our approach to identify other forms of collective motion, such as convoys and swarms, paving the way for more comprehensive multi-agent behavior analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[DDAT: Diffusion Policies Enforcing Dynamically Admissible Robot Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15043v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel at creating images and videos thanks to their multimodal generative capabilities. These same capabilities have made diffusion models increasingly popular in robotics research, where they are used for generating robot motion. However, the stochastic nature of diffusion models is fundamentally at odds with the precise dynamical equations describing the feasible motion of robots. Hence, generating dynamically admissible robot trajectories is a challenge for diffusion models. To alleviate this issue, we introduce DDAT: Diffusion policies for Dynamically Admissible Trajectories to generate provably admissible trajectories of black-box robotic systems using diffusion models. A sequence of states is a dynamically admissible trajectory if each state of the sequence belongs to the reachable set of its predecessor by the robot's equations of motion. To generate such trajectories, our diffusion policies project their predictions onto a dynamically admissible manifold during both training and inference to align the objective of the denoiser neural network with the dynamical admissibility constraint. The auto-regressive nature of these projections along with the black-box nature of robot dynamics render these projections immensely challenging. We thus enforce admissibility by iteratively sampling a polytopic under-approximation of the reachable set of a state onto which we project its predicted successor, before iterating this process with the projected successor. By producing accurate trajectories, this projection eliminates the need for diffusion models to continually replan, enabling one-shot long-horizon trajectory planning. We demonstrate that our framework generates higher quality dynamically admissible robot trajectories through extensive simulations on a quadcopter and various MuJoCo environments, along with real-world experiments on a Unitree GO1 and GO2.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Finding Complex Patterns in Trajectory Data via Geometric Set Cover](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14865v2)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clustering trajectories is a central challenge when faced with large amounts of movement data such as GPS data. We study a clustering problem that can be stated as a geometric set cover problem: Given a polygonal curve of complexity $n$, find the smallest number $k$ of representative trajectories of complexity at most $l$ such that any point on the input trajectories lies on a subtrajectory of the input that has Fr\'echet distance at most $\Delta$ to one of the representative trajectories. In previous work, Br\"uning et al.~(2022) developed a bicriteria approximation algorithm that returns a set of curves of size $O(kl\log(kl))$ which covers the input with a radius of $11\Delta$ in time $\widetilde{O}((kl)^2n + kln^3)$, where $k$ is the smallest number of curves of complexity $l$ needed to cover the input with a radius of $\Delta$. The representative trajectories computed by this algorithm are always line segments. In the applications however, one is usually interested in more complex representative curves which consist of several edges. We present a new approach that builds upon previous work computing a set of curves of size $O(k\log(n))$ in time $\widetilde{O}(l^2n^4 + kln^4)$ with the same distance guarantee of $11\Delta$, where each curve may consist of curves of complexity up to the given complexity parameter~$l$. We conduct experiments on tracking data of ocean currents and full body motion data suggesting its validity as a tool for analyzing large spatio-temporal data sets.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Target Tracking to Targeting Track -- Part I: A Metric for Spatio-Temporal Trajectory Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15842v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of target tracking, performance evaluation plays a pivotal role in the design, comparison, and analytics of trackers. Compared with the traditional trajectory composed of a set of point-estimates obtained by a tracker in the measurement time-series, the trajectory that our series of studies including this paper pursued is given by a curve function of time (FoT). The trajectory FoT provides complete information of the movement of the target over time and can be used to infer the state corresponding to arbitrary time, not only at the measurement time. However, there are no metrics available for comparing and evaluating the trajectory FoT. To address this lacuna, we propose a metric denominated as the spatiotemporal-aligned trajectory integral distance (Star-ID). The StarID associates and aligns the estimated and actual trajectories in the spatio-temporal domain and distinguishes between the time-aligned and unaligned segments in calculating the spatial divergence including false alarm, miss-detection and localization errors. The effectiveness of the proposed distance metric and the time-averaged version is validated through theoretical analysis and numerical examples of a single target or multiple targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Part ...</summary><p>Part I of a series of companion papers; 11 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

To address this challenge, we incorporate discrete barrier states (DBaS) into MPPI and propose a novel MPPI-DBaS algorithm that ensures system safety and enables adaptive exploration across diverse scenarios. We evaluate our method in simulation experiments where the vehicle navigates through closely placed obstacles.

Existing work primarily focuses on behavior cloning from expert demonstrations and preference learning through exploratory trajectory sampling. However, these methods often struggle in long-horizon tasks, where suboptimal actions accumulate step by step, causing agents to deviate from correct task trajectories. To address this, we highlight the importance of timely calibration and the need to automatically construct calibration trajectories for training agents. We propose Step-Level Trajectory Calibration (STeCa), a novel framework for LLM agent learning. Specifically, STeCa identifies suboptimal actions through a step-level reward comparison during exploration. It constructs calibrated trajectories using LLM-driven reflection, enabling agents to learn from improved decision-making processes. These calibrated trajectories, together with successful trajectory data, are utilized for reinforced training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STeCa significantly outperforms existing methods. Further analysis highlights that step-level calibration enables agents to complete tasks with greater robustness. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/WangHanLinHenry/STeCa.</p></details> |  |

The proposed framework leverages the potential of the complementarity constraint as a decision-maker and an indicator for diverse cooperative tasks and extends it to the collaborative landing scenario. In a potential application of the proposed methodology, a ground mobile robot may serve as a mobile charging station and coordinates in real-time with a quadrotor to be charged, facilitating a safe and efficient rendezvous and landing. We verified the generated trajectories in simulation and real-world applications, demonstrating the real-time capabilities of the proposed landing planning framework.</p></details> |  |

The key challenge lies in leveraging latent spatiotemporal correlations within RSS data while navigating complex road networks. To address this, we develop a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based RSS embedding (HRE) technique that employs alternating optimization to infer vehicle trajectories from RSS measurements. This model captures spatiotemporal dependencies while a road graph ensures network compliance. Additionally, we introduce a maximum speed-constrained rough trajectory estimation (MSR) method to guide the optimization process, enabling rapid convergence to a favorable local solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explorer: Scaling Exploration-driven Web Trajectory Synthesis for Multimodal Web Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11357v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent success in large multimodal models (LMMs) has sparked promising applications of agents capable of autonomously completing complex web tasks. While open-source LMM agents have made significant advances in offline evaluation benchmarks, their performance still falls substantially short of human-level capabilities in more realistic online settings. A key bottleneck is the lack of diverse and large-scale trajectory-level datasets across various domains, which are expensive to collect. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing a scalable recipe to synthesize the largest and most diverse trajectory-level dataset to date, containing over 94K successful multimodal web trajectories, spanning 49K unique URLs, 720K screenshots, and 33M web elements. In particular, we leverage extensive web exploration and refinement to obtain diverse task intents. The average cost is 28 cents per successful trajectory, making it affordable to a wide range of users in the community. Leveraging this dataset, we train Explorer, a multimodal web agent, and demonstrate strong performance on both offline and online web agent benchmarks such as Mind2Web-Live, Multimodal-Mind2Web, and MiniWob++. Additionally, our experiments highlight data scaling as a key driver for improving web agent capabilities. We hope this study makes state-of-the-art LMM-based agent research at a larger scale more accessible.</p></details> | 24 pages, 7 figures |
| **[BoundPlanner: A convex-set-based approach to bounded manipulator trajectory planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13286v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online trajectory planning enables robot manipulators to react quickly to changing environments or tasks. Many robot trajectory planners exist for known environments but are often too slow for online computations. Current methods in online trajectory planning do not find suitable trajectories in challenging scenarios that respect the limits of the robot and account for collisions. This work proposes a trajectory planning framework consisting of the novel Cartesian path planner based on convex sets, called BoundPlanner, and the online trajectory planner BoundMPC. BoundPlanner explores and maps the collision-free space using convex sets to compute a reference path with bounds. BoundMPC is extended in this work to handle convex sets for path deviations, which allows the robot to optimally follow the path within the bounds while accounting for the robot's kinematics. Collisions of the robot's kinematic chain are considered by a novel convex-set-based collision avoidance formulation independent on the number of obstacles. Simulations and experiments with a 7-DoF manipulator show the performance of the proposed planner compared to state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at github.com/Thieso/BoundPlanner and videos of the experiments can be found at www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/42d4</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Our vehicle simulator efficiently models vehicle motion, generating trajectories that can be supervised to fit real-world data. By leveraging its differentiable nature, IDM parameters are optimized using gradient-based methods. With the capability to simulate up to 2 million vehicles in real time, the system is scalable for large-scale trajectory optimization. We show that we can use the simulator to filter noise in the input trajectories (trajectory filtering), reconstruct dense trajectories from sparse ones (trajectory reconstruction), and predict future trajectories (trajectory prediction), with all generated trajectories adhering to physical laws. We validate our simulator and algorithm on several datasets including NGSIM and Waymo Open Dataset.

To address this challenge, and reduce the risk of disrupting operations, we leverage recent advances in Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) to develop a neural state-space model (NSSM) that predicts plasma dynamics during Tokamak \`a Configuration Variable (TCV) rampdowns. By integrating simple physics structure and data-driven models, the NSSM efficiently learns plasma dynamics during the rampdown from a modest dataset of 311 pulses with only five pulses in the reactor relevant high performance regime. The NSSM is parallelized across uncertainties, and reinforcement learning (RL) is applied to design trajectories that avoid multiple instability limits with high probability. Experiments at TCV ramping down high performance plasmas show statistically significant improvements in current and energy at plasma termination, with improvements in speed through continuous re-training. A predict-first experiment, increasing plasma current by 20\% from baseline, demonstrates the NSSM's ability to make small extrapolations with sufficient accuracy to design trajectories that successfully terminate the pulse. The developed approach paves the way for designing tokamak controls with robustness to considerable uncertainty, and demonstrates the relevance of the SciML approach to learning plasma dynamics for rapidly developing robust trajectories and controls during the incremental campaigns of upcoming burning plasma tokamaks.</p></details> |  |

Existing RL-based fine-tuning methods focus on single training timesteps and neglect trajectory-level alignment, while recent sampling trajectory optimization methods incur significant inference NFE costs. Diffusion-Sharpening overcomes this by using a path integral framework to select optimal trajectories during training, leveraging reward feedback, and amortizing inference costs. Our method demonstrates superior training efficiency with faster convergence, and best inference efficiency without requiring additional NFEs. Extensive experiments show that Diffusion-Sharpening outperforms RL-based fine-tuning methods (e.g., Diffusion-DPO) and sampling trajectory optimization methods (e.g., Inference Scaling) across diverse metrics including text alignment, compositional capabilities, and human preferences, offering a scalable and efficient solution for future diffusion model fine-tuning.

| **[Leader and Follower: Interactive Motion Generation under Trajectory Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11563v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of game and film production, generating interactive motion from texts has garnered significant attention due to its potential to revolutionize content creation processes. In many practical applications, there is a need to impose strict constraints on the motion range or trajectory of virtual characters. However, existing methods that rely solely on textual input face substantial challenges in accurately capturing the user's intent, particularly in specifying the desired trajectory. As a result, the generated motions often lack plausibility and accuracy. Moreover, existing trajectory - based methods for customized motion generation rely on retraining for single - actor scenarios, which limits flexibility and adaptability to different datasets, as well as interactivity in two-actor motions. To generate interactive motion following specified trajectories, this paper decouples complex motion into a Leader - Follower dynamic, inspired by role allocation in partner dancing. Based on this framework, this paper explores the motion range refinement process in interactive motion generation and proposes a training-free approach, integrating a Pace Controller and a Kinematic Synchronization Adapter. The framework enhances the ability of existing models to generate motion that adheres to trajectory by controlling the leader's movement and correcting the follower's motion to align with the leader. Experimental results show that the proposed approach, by better leveraging trajectory information, outperforms existing methods in both realism and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[A linear-time algorithm computing the resident fitness in interacting trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11561v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The notion of a system of interacting trajectories was recently introduced by Hermann, Gonz\'alez Casanova, Soares dos Santos, T\'obi\'as and Wakolbinger. Such a system of $[0,1]$-valued piecewise linear trajectories arises as a scaling limit of the system of logarithmic subpopulation sizes in a certain population-genetic model (more precisely, a Moran model) with mutation and selection. By definition, the resident fitness is initially 0 and afterwards it increases by the ultimate slope of each trajectory that reaches height 1. We show that although the interaction of $n$ trajectories may yield $\Omega(n^2)$ slope changes in total, the resident fitness (at all times) can be computed algorithmically in $O(n)$ time. Our algorithm is given in terms of the so-called continued lines representation of the system of interacting trajectories. In the special case of Poissonian interacting trajectories where the birth times of the trajectories form a Poisson process and the initial slopes are random and i.i.d., we show that even the expected number of slope changes grows only linearly in time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reducing Computational Complexity of Rigidity-Based UAV Trajectory Optimization for Real-Time Cooperative Target Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11278v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and swift localization of the target is crucial in emergencies. However, accurate position data of a target mobile device, typically obtained from global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), cellular networks, or WiFi, may not always be accessible to first responders. For instance, 1) accuracy and availability can be limited in challenging signal reception environments, and 2) in regions where emergency location services are not mandatory, certain mobile devices may not transmit their location during emergencies. As an alternative localization method, a network of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be employed to passively locate targets by collecting radio frequency (RF) signal measurements, such as received signal strength (RSS). In these situations, UAV trajectories play a critical role in localization performance, influencing both accuracy and search time. Previous studies optimized UAV trajectories using the determinant of the Fisher information matrix (FIM), but its performance declines under unfavorable geometric conditions, such as when UAVs start from a single base, leading to position ambiguity. To address this, our prior work introduced a rigidity-based approach, which improved the search time compared to FIM-based methods in our simulation case. However, the high computational cost of rigidity-based optimization, primarily due to singular value decomposition (SVD), limits its practicality. In this paper, we applied techniques to reduce computational complexity, including randomized SVD, smooth SVD, and vertex pruning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ION ITM 2025</p></details> |

Past research relied on incorporating deterministic future states of surrounding pedestrians which can be overconfident leading to unsafe robot behaviour. The current paper proposes a predictive uncertainty-aware planner that integrates neural network based probabilistic trajectory prediction into planning. Our method uses a deep ensemble based network for probabilistic forecasting of surrounding humans and integrates the predictive uncertainty as constraints into the planner. We compare numerous constraint satisfaction methods on the planner and evaluated its performance on real world pedestrian datasets. Further, offline robot navigation was carried out on out-of-distribution pedestrian trajectories inside a narrow corridor</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Trajectory-guided Policy for Long-horizon Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10040v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Vision-Language-Action models (VLA) have advanced robot imitation learning, but high data collection costs and limited demonstrations hinder generalization and current imitation learning methods struggle in out-of-distribution scenarios, especially for long-horizon tasks. A key challenge is how to mitigate compounding errors in imitation learning, which lead to cascading failures over extended trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose the Diffusion Trajectory-guided Policy (DTP) framework, which generates 2D trajectories through a diffusion model to guide policy learning for long-horizon tasks. By leveraging task-relevant trajectories, DTP provides trajectory-level guidance to reduce error accumulation. Our two-stage approach first trains a generative vision-language model to create diffusion-based trajectories, then refines the imitation policy using them. Experiments on the CALVIN benchmark show that DTP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 25% in success rate, starting from scratch without external pretraining. Moreover, DTP significantly improves real-world robot performance.</p></details> |  |

Without loosing any information, we associate to each state a binary random function, taking values in $\{0,1\}$, and turn the problem of statistical modeling of a categorical process into a multivariate functional data analysis issue. The (multivariate) covariance operator has nice interpretations in terms of departure from independence of the joint probabilities and the multivariate functional principal components are simple to interpret. Under the weak hypothesis assuming only continuity in probability of the $0-1$ trajectories, it is simple to build consistent estimators of the covariance kernel and perform multivariate functional principal components analysis. The sample paths being piecewise constant, with a finite number of jumps, this a rare case in functional data analysis in which the trajectories can be observed exhaustively. The approach is illustrated on a data set of sensory perceptions, considering different gustometer-controlled stimuli experiments. We show how it can be easily extended to analyze experiments, such as temporal check-all-that-apply, in which two states or more can be observed at the same time.</p></details> |  |

We frame this problem as an instance of abduction guided by a novel parsimony function represented as an aggregate truth value over an annotated logic program. This approach has the added benefit of affording explainability to an analyst user. By showing that any subset of such a program can provide a lower bound on this parsimony requirement, we are able to abduce movement trajectories efficiently through an informed (i.e., A*) search. We describe how our implementation was enhanced with the application of multiple techniques in order to be scaled and integrated with a cloud-based software stack that included bottom-up rule learning, geolocated knowledge graph retrieval/management, and interfaces with government systems for independently conducted government-run tests for which we provide results. We also report on our own experiments showing that we not only provide exact results but also scale to very large scenarios and provide realistic agent trajectories that can go undetected by machine learning anomaly detectors.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ICLP 2024, arXiv:2502.08453</p></details> |

Our analysis demonstrates that poor quality input leads to noisy and unreliable predictions, which can be detrimental to navigation modules. We evaluate both input data quality and model output to illustrate the impact of input noise. Furthermore, we show that our estimation system enables effective training of trajectory prediction models even with limited data, producing robust predictions across different environments.

However, due to the highly dynamic and multimodal nature of the task, accurately predicting the future trajectory of a target vehicle remains a significant challenge. To address this challenge, we propose an Ego vehicle Planning-informed Network (EPN) for multimodal trajectory prediction. In real-world driving, the future trajectory of a vehicle is influenced not only by its own historical trajectory, but also by the behavior of other vehicles. So, we incorporate the future planned trajectory of the ego vehicle as an additional input to simulate the mutual influence between vehicles. Furthermore, to tackle the challenges of intention ambiguity and large prediction errors often encountered in methods based on driving intentions, we propose an endpoint prediction module for the target vehicle. This module predicts the target vehicle endpoints, refines them using a correction mechanism, and generates a multimodal predicted trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that EPN achieves an average reduction of 34.9%, 30.7%, and 30.4% in RMSE, ADE, and FDE on the NGSIM dataset, and an average reduction of 64.6%, 64.5%, and 64.3% in RMSE, ADE, and FDE on the HighD dataset.

One-step diffusion models generate high-quality images in a one sampling step, greatly reducing computational overhead and inference latency. However, most existing one-step diffusion methods are constrained by the performance of the teacher model, where poor teacher performance results in image artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose FluxSR, a novel one-step diffusion Real-ISR technique based on flow matching models. We use the state-of-the-art diffusion model FLUX.1-dev as both the teacher model and the base model. First, we introduce Flow Trajectory Distillation (FTD) to distill a multi-step flow matching model into a one-step Real-ISR. Second, to improve image realism and address high-frequency artifact issues in generated images, we propose TV-LPIPS as a perceptual loss and introduce Attention Diversification Loss (ADL) as a regularization term to reduce token similarity in transformer, thereby eliminating high-frequency artifacts. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing one-step diffusion-based Real-ISR methods.

Cycling data has especially been the focus of data collection endeavors in recent years. Although privacy risks regarding location data are widely known, practitioners often refrain from advanced privacy mechanisms to prevent utility losses. Removing user identifiers from trips is thereby deemed a major privacy gain, as it supposedly prevents linking single trips to obtain entire movement patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel attack to reconstruct user identifiers in GPS trip datasets consisting of single trips, unlike previous ones that are dedicated to evaluating trajectory-user linking in the context of check-in data. We evaluate the remaining privacy risk for users in such datasets and our empirical findings from two real-world datasets show that the risk of re-identification is significant even when personal identifiers have been removed, and that truncation as a simple additional privacy mechanism may not be effective in protecting user privacy. Further investigations indicate that users who frequently visit locations that are only visited by a small number of others, tend to be more vulnerable to re-identification.</p></details> | 32 pages, 15 figures |

Existing methods, however, often obscure critical local hotspots by only considering the start and end positions of objects' trajectories. To address this gap, we propose RouteFlow, a trajectory-aware animated transition method that effectively balances the global trend and local hotspots while minimizing occlusion. RouteFlow is inspired by a real-world bus route analogy: objects are regarded as passengers traveling together, with local hotspots representing bus stops where these passengers get on and off. Based on this analogy, animation paths are generated like bus routes, with the object layout generated similarly to seat allocation according to their destinations. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, RouteFlow better facilitates identifying the global trend and locating local hotspots while performing comparably in tracking objects' movements.</p></details> | Accepted to CHI 2025 |

As the backbone of next-generation solutions, these robots face a critical challenge: managing and minimizing the swept volume during turns while maintaining precise control. Traditional systems designed for standard vehicles often struggle with the complex dynamics of multi-axle configurations, leading to inefficiency and increased safety risk in confined spaces. Our innovative framework overcomes these limitations by combining swept volume minimization with Signed Distance Field (SDF) path planning and model predictive control (MPC) for independent wheel steering. This approach not only plans paths with an awareness of the swept volume but actively minimizes it in real-time, allowing each axle to follow a precise trajectory while significantly reducing the space the vehicle occupies. By predicting future states and adjusting the turning radius of each wheel, our method enhances both maneuverability and safety, even in the most constrained environments. Unlike previous works, our solution goes beyond basic path calculation and tracking, offering real-time path optimization with minimal swept volume and efficient individual axle control. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive approach to tackle these challenges, delivering life-saving improvements in control, efficiency, and safety for multi-axle AMRs. Furthermore, we will open-source our work to foster collaboration and enable others to advance safer, more efficient autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper Accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Despite significant advancements in this field, existing studies primarily neglect the high-order inter-trajectory relationships, which represent complex associations among multiple trajectories, manifested through multi-location co-occurrence patterns emerging when trajectories intersect at various Points of Interest (POIs). Furthermore, they also overlook the variable influence of POIs on different trajectories, as well as the user class imbalance problem caused by disparities in user activity levels and check-in frequencies. To address these limitations, we propose a novel HyperGraph-based multi-perspective Trajectory User Linking model (HGTUL). Our model learns trajectory representations from both relational and spatio-temporal perspectives: (1) it captures high-order associations among trajectories by constructing a trajectory hypergraph and leverages a hypergraph attention network to learn the variable impact of POIs on trajectories; (2) it models the spatio-temporal characteristics of trajectories by incorporating their temporal and spatial information into a sequential encoder. Moreover, we design a data balancing method to effectively address the user class imbalance problem and experimentally validate its significance in TUL. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HGTUL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving improvements of 2.57%~20.09% and 5.68%~26.00% in ACC@1 and Macro-F1 metrics, respectively.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[PLMTrajRec: A Scalable and Generalizable Trajectory Recovery Method with Pre-trained Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14281v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal trajectory data is crucial for various applications. However, issues such as device malfunctions and network instability often cause sparse trajectories, leading to lost detailed movement information. Recovering the missing points in sparse trajectories to restore the detailed information is thus essential. Despite recent progress, several challenges remain. First, the lack of large-scale dense trajectory data makes it difficult to train a trajectory recovery model from scratch. Second, the varying spatiotemporal correlations in sparse trajectories make it hard to generalize recovery across different sampling intervals. Third, the lack of location information complicates the extraction of road conditions for missing points. To address these challenges, we propose a novel trajectory recovery model called PLMTrajRec. It leverages the scalability of a pre-trained language model (PLM) and can be fine-tuned with only a limited set of dense trajectories. To handle different sampling intervals in sparse trajectories, we first convert each trajectory's sampling interval and movement features into natural language representations, allowing the PLM to recognize its interval. We then introduce a trajectory encoder to unify trajectories of varying intervals into a single interval and capture their spatiotemporal relationships. To obtain road conditions for missing points, we propose an area flow-guided implicit trajectory prompt, which models road conditions by collecting traffic flows in each region. We also introduce a road condition passing mechanism that uses observed points' road conditions to infer those of the missing points. Experiments on two public trajectory datasets with three sampling intervals each demonstrate the effectiveness, scalability, and generalization ability of PLMTrajRec.</p></details> |  |

However, existing trajectory generation methods often focus on improving trajectory generation quality from a singular perspective, lacking a comprehensive semantic understanding across various scales. Consequently, we are inspired to develop a HOlistic SEmantic Representation (HOSER) framework for navigational trajectory generation. Given an origin-and-destination (OD) pair and the starting time point of a latent trajectory, we first propose a Road Network Encoder to expand the receptive field of road- and zone-level semantics. Second, we design a Multi-Granularity Trajectory Encoder to integrate the spatio-temporal semantics of the generated trajectory at both the point and trajectory levels. Finally, we employ a Destination-Oriented Navigator to seamlessly integrate destination-oriented guidance. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HOSER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin. Moreover, the model's performance in few-shot learning and zero-shot learning scenarios further verifies the effectiveness of our holistic semantic representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

A diverse set of methods (e.g., rule-based or learned with different architectures and datasets) have been proposed, yet it is often the case that the performance of these methods is sensitive to the deployment environment (e.g., how well the design rules model the environment, or how accurately the test data match the training data). Building upon the principled theory of online convex optimization but also going beyond convexity and stationarity, we present a lightweight and model-agnostic method to aggregate different trajectory predictors online. We propose treating each individual trajectory predictor as an "expert" and maintaining a probability vector to mix the outputs of different experts. Then, the key technical approach lies in leveraging online data -- the true agent behavior to be revealed at the next timestep -- to form a convex-or-nonconvex, stationary-or-dynamic loss function whose gradient steers the probability vector towards choosing the best mixture of experts. We instantiate this method to aggregate trajectory predictors trained on different cities in the NUSCENES dataset and show that it performs just as well, if not better than, any singular model, even when deployed on the out-of-distribution LYFT dataset.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Reward-Based Collision-Free Algorithm for Trajectory Planning of Autonomous Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06149v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a new mission planning algorithm for autonomous robots that enables the reward-based selection of an optimal waypoint sequence from a predefined set. The algorithm computes a feasible trajectory and corresponding control inputs for a robot to navigate between waypoints while avoiding obstacles, maximizing the total reward, and adhering to constraints on state, input and its derivatives, mission time window, and maximum distance. This also solves a generalized prize-collecting traveling salesman problem. The proposed algorithm employs a new genetic algorithm that evolves solution candidates toward the optimal solution based on a fitness function and crossover. During fitness evaluation, a penalty method enforces constraints, and the differential flatness property with clothoid curves efficiently penalizes infeasible trajectories. The Euler spiral method showed promising results for trajectory parameterization compared to minimum snap and jerk polynomials. Due to the discrete exploration space, crossover is performed using a dynamic time-warping-based method and extended convex combination with projection. A mutation step enhances exploration. Results demonstrate the algorithm's ability to find the optimal waypoint sequence, fulfill constraints, avoid infeasible waypoints, and prioritize high-reward ones. Simulations and experiments with a ground vehicle, quadrotor, and quadruped are presented, complemented by benchmarking and a time-complexity analysis.</p></details> |  |

While many promising methods have been developed using online corpora and captioned photographs, their application to scientific domains, where data encodes highly specialized knowledge, remains in its early stages. We present a self-supervised masked modeling framework for 3D particle trajectory analysis in Time Projection Chambers (TPCs). These detectors produce globally sparse (<1% occupancy) but locally dense point clouds, capturing meter-scale particle trajectories at millimeter resolution. Starting with PointMAE, this work proposes volumetric tokenization to group sparse ionization points into resolution-agnostic patches, as well as an auxiliary energy infilling task to improve trajectory semantics. This approach -- which we call Point-based Liquid Argon Masked Autoencoder (PoLAr-MAE) -- achieves 99.4% track and 97.7% shower classification F-scores, matching that of supervised baselines without any labeled data. While the model learns rich particle trajectory representations, it struggles with sub-token phenomena like overlapping or short-lived particle trajectories. To support further research, we release PILArNet-M -- the largest open LArTPC dataset (1M+ events, 5.2B labeled points) -- to advance SSL in high energy physics (HEP).

Traditional approaches usually focus on static road network and trajectory representation learning, and overlook the dynamic nature of traffic states and trajectories, which is crucial for downstream tasks. To address this gap, we propose TRACK, a novel framework to bridge traffic state and trajectory data for dynamic road network and trajectory representation learning. TRACK leverages graph attention networks (GAT) to encode static and spatial road segment features, and introduces a transformer-based model for trajectory representation learning. By incorporating transition probabilities from trajectory data into GAT attention weights, TRACK captures dynamic spatial features of road segments. Meanwhile, TRACK designs a traffic transformer encoder to capture the spatial-temporal dynamics of road segments from traffic state data. To further enhance dynamic representations, TRACK proposes a co-attentional transformer encoder and a trajectory-traffic state matching task. Extensive experiments on real-life urban traffic datasets demonstrate the superiority of TRACK over state-of-the-art baselines. Case studies confirm TRACK's ability to capture spatial-temporal dynamics effectively.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

In particular, real trajectories in the wildlife domain are scarce as a result of ethical and environmental constraints of the collection process. In this paper, we consider the problem of generating long-horizon trajectories, akin to wildlife migration, based on a small set of real samples. We propose a hierarchical approach to learn the global movement characteristics of the real dataset and recursively refine localized regions. Our solution, WildGraph, discretizes the geographic path into a prototype network of H3 (https://www.uber.com/blog/h3/) regions and leverages a recurrent variational auto-encoder to probabilistically generate paths over the regions, based on occupancy. WildGraph successfully generates realistic months-long trajectories using a sample size as small as 60. Experiments performed on two wildlife migration datasets demonstrate that our proposed method improves the generalization of the generated trajectories in comparison to existing work while achieving superior or comparable performance in several benchmark metrics. Our code is published on the following repository: https://github.com/aliwister/wildgraph.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, SIGSPATIAL '24</p></details> |

Previous methods on controllable video generation primarily leverage 2D control signals to manipulate object motions and have achieved remarkable synthesis results. However, 2D control signals are inherently limited in expressing the 3D nature of object motions. To overcome this problem, we introduce 3DTrajMaster, a robust controller that regulates multi-entity dynamics in 3D space, given user-desired 6DoF pose (location and rotation) sequences of entities. At the core of our approach is a plug-and-play 3D-motion grounded object injector that fuses multiple input entities with their respective 3D trajectories through a gated self-attention mechanism. In addition, we exploit an injector architecture to preserve the video diffusion prior, which is crucial for generalization ability. To mitigate video quality degradation, we introduce a domain adaptor during training and employ an annealed sampling strategy during inference. To address the lack of suitable training data, we construct a 360-Motion Dataset, which first correlates collected 3D human and animal assets with GPT-generated trajectory and then captures their motion with 12 evenly-surround cameras on diverse 3D UE platforms. Extensive experiments show that 3DTrajMaster sets a new state-of-the-art in both accuracy and generalization for controlling multi-entity 3D motions.

Here, such characterization for the optimal learning trajectories is associated with the solution of an optimal control problem for a weakly-controlled gradient system with small parameters, whose time-evolution is guided by a model training dataset and its perturbed version, while the optimization problem consists of a cost functional that summarizes how to gauge the quality/performance of the estimated model parameters at a certain fixed final time w.r.t. a model validating dataset.

Despite growing interest, recent approaches often struggle with two major challenges: multi-dancer collisions and single-dancer foot sliding. To address these challenges, we propose a Trajectory-Controllable Diffusion (TCDiff) framework, which leverages non-overlapping trajectories to ensure coherent and aesthetically pleasing dance movements. To mitigate collisions, we introduce a Dance-Trajectory Navigator that generates collision-free trajectories for multiple dancers, utilizing a distance-consistency loss to maintain optimal spacing. Furthermore, to reduce foot sliding, we present a footwork adaptor that adjusts trajectory displacement between frames, supported by a relative forward-kinematic loss to further reinforce the correlation between movements and trajectories. Experiments demonstrate our method's superiority.</p></details> |  |
| **[M$^3$PC: Test-time Model Predictive Control for Pretrained Masked Trajectory Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05675v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work in Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown that a unified Transformer trained under a masked auto-encoding objective can effectively capture the relationships between different modalities (e.g., states, actions, rewards) within given trajectory datasets. However, this information has not been fully exploited during the inference phase, where the agent needs to generate an optimal policy instead of just reconstructing masked components from unmasked ones. Given that a pretrained trajectory model can act as both a Policy Model and a World Model with appropriate mask patterns, we propose using Model Predictive Control (MPC) at test time to leverage the model's own predictive capability to guide its action selection. Empirical results on D4RL and RoboMimic show that our inference-phase MPC significantly improves the decision-making performance of a pretrained trajectory model without any additional parameter training. Furthermore, our framework can be adapted to Offline to Online (O2O) RL and Goal Reaching RL, resulting in more substantial performance gains when an additional online interaction budget is provided, and better generalization capabilities when different task targets are specified.

| **[Spatiotemporal Trajectory Tracking Method for Vehicles Incorporating Lead-Lag Judgement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03974v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the domain of intelligent transportation systems, especially within the context of autonomous vehicle control, the preemptive holistic collaborative system has been presented as a promising solution to bring a remarkable enhancement in traffic efficiency and a substantial reduction in the accident rate, demonstrating a great potential of development. In order to ensure this system operates as intended, accurate tracking of the spatiotemporal trajectory is of crucial significance. Moreover, minimizing the tracking error is a necessary step in this process. To this end, a novel lead-lag judgment mechanism is proposed. This mechanism precisely quantifies the longitudinal positional deviation between the vehicle and the target trajectory over time, then the deviation is corrected with a real - time acceleration compensation strategy, as a result, the accuracy and reliability of trajectory tracking are significantly enhanced. Real - vehicle experiments were conducted in a dedicated test field to validate the feasibility of this innovative approach empirically. Subsequently, the obtained tracking data was subsequent processed using the lead-lag judgment mechanism. In this step, we carefully analyzed the spatiotemporal error patterns between the vehicle and the target trajectory under different alignments and speeds. Finally, using real highway speed and alignment data, we conducted comprehensive spatiotemporal trajectory tracking simulations. Through experiments and simulations, tracking errors maintained in an acceptable range and reasonable spatiotemporal distance is given during the preemptive merging process on highway ramps. Overall, this study offers valuable insights for highway ramp emerging safety. Future work can expand on these findings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reduce Lap Time for Autonomous Racing with Curvature-Integrated MPCC Local Trajectory Planning Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03695v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread application of autonomous driving technology has significantly advanced the field of autonomous racing. Model Predictive Contouring Control (MPCC) is a highly effective local trajectory planning method for autonomous racing. However, the traditional MPCC method struggles with racetracks that have significant curvature changes, limiting the performance of the vehicle during autonomous racing. To address this issue, we propose a curvature-integrated MPCC (CiMPCC) local trajectory planning method for autonomous racing. This method optimizes the velocity of the local trajectory based on the curvature of the racetrack centerline. The specific implementation involves mapping the curvature of the racetrack centerline to a reference velocity profile, which is then incorporated into the cost function for optimizing the velocity of the local trajectory. This reference velocity profile is created by normalizing and mapping the curvature of the racetrack centerline, thereby ensuring efficient and performance-oriented local trajectory planning in racetracks with significant curvature. The proposed CiMPCC method has been experimented on a self-built 1:10 scale F1TENTH racing vehicle deployed with ROS platform. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves outstanding results on a challenging racetrack with sharp curvature, improving the overall lap time by 11.4%-12.5% compared to other autonomous racing trajectory planning methods.

However, applying these models requires inferring their specifications from observed behaviors -- a challenging task known as the inverse game problem. Existing inverse game approaches often struggle to account for behavioral uncertainty and measurement noise, and leverage both offline and online data. To address these limitations, we propose an inverse game method that integrates a generative trajectory model into a differentiable mixed-strategy game framework. By representing the mixed strategy with a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), our method can infer high-dimensional, multi-modal behavior distributions from noisy measurements while adapting in real-time to new observations. We extensively evaluate our method in a simulated navigation benchmark, where the observations are generated by an unknown game model. Despite the model mismatch, our method can infer Nash-optimal actions comparable to those of the ground-truth model and the oracle inverse game baseline, even in the presence of uncertain agent objectives and noisy measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025. 8 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

In this paper, we present a solution for this problem using a novel drag-aware model formulation which is coupled with MPC, and therefore, enables tracking and landing during high-speed curvilinear trajectories of an USV without any communication. Compared to the state-of-the-art, our approach yields 40% decrease in prediction errors, and provides a 3-fold increase in certainty of predictions. Consequently, this leads to a 30% improvement in tracking performance and 40% higher success in landing on a moving USV even during aggressive turns that are unfeasible for conventional marine missions. We test our approach in two different real-world scenarios with marine vessels of two different sizes and further solidify our results through statistical analysis in simulation to demonstrate the robustness of our method.</p></details> |  |

To ensure safety, planners require reliable uncertainty estimates of the predicted behavior of surrounding agents, yet this aspect has received limited attention. In particular, decomposing uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic components is essential for distinguishing between inherent environmental randomness and model uncertainty, thereby enabling more robust and informed decision-making. This paper addresses the challenge of uncertainty modeling in trajectory prediction with a holistic approach that emphasizes uncertainty quantification, decomposition, and the impact of model composition. Our method, grounded in information theory, provides a theoretically principled way to measure uncertainty and decompose it into aleatoric and epistemic components. Unlike prior work, our approach is compatible with state-of-the-art motion predictors, allowing for broader applicability. We demonstrate its utility by conducting extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset, which shows how different architectures and configurations influence uncertainty quantification and model robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, submitted to International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> |

Supervised deep learning methods provide accurate road segmentation in the domain of their training data but cannot be trusted in out-of-distribution scenarios. Including the whole distribution in the trainset is challenging as each sample must be labeled by hand. Trajectory-based self-supervised methods offer a potential solution as they can learn from the traversed route without manual labels. However, existing trajectory-based methods use learning schemes that rely only on the camera or only on the lidar. In this paper, trajectory-based learning is implemented jointly with lidar and camera for increased performance. Our method outperforms recent standalone camera- and lidar-based methods when evaluated with a challenging winter driving dataset including countryside and suburb driving scenes.

Previous studies aim to predict gaze trajectories when humans are free-viewing an image, searching for required targets, or looking for clues to answer questions in an image. While these tasks focus on visual-centric scenarios, humans move their gaze also along with audio signal inputs in more common scenarios. To fill this gap, we introduce a new task that predicts human gaze trajectories in a visual scene with synchronized audio inputs and provide a new dataset containing 20k gaze points from 8 subjects. To effectively integrate audio information and simulate the dynamic process of human gaze motion, we propose a novel learning framework called EyEar (Eye moving while Ear listening) based on physics-informed dynamics, which considers three key factors to predict gazes: eye inherent motion tendency, vision salient attraction, and audio semantic attraction. We also propose a probability density score to overcome the high individual variability of gaze trajectories, thereby improving the stabilization of optimization and the reliability of the evaluation. Experimental results show that EyEar outperforms all the baselines in the context of all evaluation metrics, thanks to the proposed components in the learning model.</p></details> |  |

This process yields a diverse, physically consistent dataset that enables cross-embodiment data transfer, and offers the potential to reuse legacy datasets collected under different hardware configurations or physical parameters. We validate the pipeline's effectiveness by training diffusion policies from the generated datasets for challenging contact-rich manipulation tasks across multiple robot embodiments, including a floating Allegro hand and bimanual robot arms.

TAP applies a rules-based cross-entropy optimization approach to learn parameters directly from data, enhancing generalization across diverse driving contexts. Using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), TAP achieves 30% greater precision than Average Displacement Error (ADE) and 24% over Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in identifying behaviorally similar trajectories. Additionally, TAP enables automated detection of unique driving behaviors, streamlining safety evaluation processes for AV testing.

However, the inherently dynamic nature of the heart imposes strict limits on acquisition times, making high-resolution T1 mapping a persistent challenge. Compressed sensing (CS) approaches have reduced scan durations by undersampling k-space and reconstructing images from partial data, and recent studies show that jointly optimizing the undersampling patterns with the reconstruction network can substantially improve performance. Still, most current T1 mapping pipelines rely on static, hand-crafted masks that do not exploit the full acceleration and accuracy potential. In this work, we introduce T1-PILOT: an end-to-end method that explicitly incorporates the T1 signal relaxation model into the sampling-reconstruction framework to guide the learning of non-Cartesian trajectories, crossframe alignment, and T1 decay estimation. Through extensive experiments on the CMRxRecon dataset, T1-PILOT significantly outperforms several baseline strategies (including learned single-mask and fixed radial or golden-angle sampling schemes), achieving higher T1 map fidelity at greater acceleration factors. In particular, we observe consistent gains in PSNR and VIF relative to existing methods, along with marked improvements in delineating finer myocardial structures. Our results highlight that optimizing sampling trajectories in tandem with the physical relaxation model leads to both enhanced quantitative accuracy and reduced acquisition times. Code for reproducing all results will be made publicly available upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Minds on the Move: Decoding Trajectory Prediction in Autonomous Driving with Cognitive Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20084v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In mixed autonomous driving environments, accurately predicting the future trajectories of surrounding vehicles is crucial for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). In driving scenarios, a vehicle's trajectory is determined by the decision-making process of human drivers. However, existing models primarily focus on the inherent statistical patterns in the data, often neglecting the critical aspect of understanding the decision-making processes of human drivers. This oversight results in models that fail to capture the true intentions of human drivers, leading to suboptimal performance in long-term trajectory prediction. To address this limitation, we introduce a Cognitive-Informed Transformer (CITF) that incorporates a cognitive concept, Perceived Safety, to interpret drivers' decision-making mechanisms. Perceived Safety encapsulates the varying risk tolerances across drivers with different driving behaviors. Specifically, we develop a Perceived Safety-aware Module that includes a Quantitative Safety Assessment for measuring the subject risk levels within scenarios, and Driver Behavior Profiling for characterizing driver behaviors. Furthermore, we present a novel module, Leanformer, designed to capture social interactions among vehicles. CITF demonstrates significant performance improvements on three well-established datasets. In terms of long-term prediction, it surpasses existing benchmarks by 12.0% on the NGSIM, 28.2% on the HighD, and 20.8% on the MoCAD dataset. Additionally, its robustness in scenarios with limited or missing data is evident, surpassing most state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, and paving the way for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

While recent learning-based methods, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in specific scenarios, RL planners struggle with training inefficiencies and managing large-scale, real-world driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CarPlanner}, a \textbf{C}onsistent \textbf{a}uto-\textbf{r}egressive \textbf{Planner} that uses RL to generate multi-modal trajectories. The auto-regressive structure enables efficient large-scale RL training, while the incorporation of consistency ensures stable policy learning by maintaining coherent temporal consistency across time steps. Moreover, CarPlanner employs a generation-selection framework with an expert-guided reward function and an invariant-view module, simplifying RL training and enhancing policy performance. Extensive analysis demonstrates that our proposed RL framework effectively addresses the challenges of training efficiency and performance enhancement, positioning CarPlanner as a promising solution for trajectory planning in autonomous driving. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that the RL-based planner can surpass both IL- and rule-based state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) on the challenging large-scale real-world dataset nuPlan. Our proposed CarPlanner surpasses RL-, IL-, and rule-based SOTA approaches within this demanding dataset.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Tracailer: An Efficient Trajectory Planner for Tractor-Trailer Vehicles in Unstructured Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19832v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tractor-trailer vehicle (robot) consists of a drivable tractor and one or more non-drivable trailers connected via hitches. Compared to typical car-like robots, the addition of trailers provides greater transportation capability. However, this also complicates motion planning due to the robot's complex kinematics, high-dimensional state space, and deformable structure. To efficiently plan safe, time-optimal trajectories that adhere to the kinematic constraints of the robot and address the challenges posed by its unique features, this paper introduces a lightweight, compact, and high-order smooth trajectory representation for tractor-trailer robots. Based on it, we design an efficiently solvable spatio-temporal trajectory optimization problem. To deal with deformable structures, which leads to difficulties in collision avoidance, we fully leverage the collision-free regions of the environment, directly applying deformations to trajectories in continuous space. This approach not requires constructing safe regions from the environment using convex approximations through collision-free seed points before each optimization, avoiding the loss of the solution space, thus reducing the dependency of the optimization on initial values. Moreover, a multi-terminal fast path search algorithm is proposed to generate the initial values for optimization. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves several-fold improvements in efficiency compared to existing algorithms, while also ensuring lower curvature and trajectory duration. Real-world experiments involving the transportation, loading and unloading of goods in both indoor and outdoor scenarios further validate the effectiveness of our method.

In this paper, a large signal model of the grid-connected VSG is first established. The trajectory reversing method (TRM) is then introduced to estimate the domain of attraction (DOA) of VSG. Subsequently, the transient instability mechanism is revealed in detail based on the estimated DOA boundary. The impacts of system parameters on the DOA range are further investigated. It is found that loss of synchronization (LOS) occurs if the system trajectory lies outside the post-fault DOA range. In scenarios where no equilibrium points exist after a grid fault, system stability can be reestablished only when the fault clearing angle (FCA) does not exceed the critical clearing angle (CCA). Finally, the CCA derived from the DOA and that from the conventional equal area criteria (EAC) are compared. The results show that CCA obtained by our solution has a higher accuracy. Time-domain simulations are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed transient stability analysis method of grid-connected VSG.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,11 figures, references added</p></details> |
| **[3D Trajectory Reconstruction of Moving Points Based on a Monocular Camera](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19689v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The motion measurement of point targets constitutes a fundamental problem in photogrammetry, with extensive applications across various engineering domains. Reconstructing a point's 3D motion just from the images captured by only a monocular camera is unfeasible without prior assumptions. Under limited observation conditions such as insufficient observations, long distance, and high observation error of platform, the least squares estimation faces the issue of ill-conditioning. This paper presents an algorithm for reconstructing 3D trajectories of moving points using a monocular camera. The motion of the points is represented through temporal polynomials. Ridge estimation is introduced to mitigate the issues of ill-conditioning caused by limited observation conditions. Then, an automatic algorithm for determining the order of the temporal polynomials is proposed. Furthermore, the definition of reconstructability for temporal polynomials is proposed to describe the reconstruction accuracy quantitatively. The simulated and real-world experimental results demonstrate the feasibility, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sports-Traj: A Unified Trajectory Generation Model for Multi-Agent Movement in Sports](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17680v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding multi-agent movement is critical across various fields. The conventional approaches typically focus on separate tasks such as trajectory prediction, imputation, or spatial-temporal recovery. Considering the unique formulation and constraint of each task, most existing methods are tailored for only one, limiting the ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, which is a common requirement in real-world scenarios. Another limitation is that widely used public datasets mainly focus on pedestrian movements with casual, loosely connected patterns, where interactions between individuals are not always present, especially at a long distance, making them less representative of more structured environments. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Unified Trajectory Generation model, UniTraj, that processes arbitrary trajectories as masked inputs, adaptable to diverse scenarios in the domain of sports games. Specifically, we introduce a Ghost Spatial Masking (GSM) module, embedded within a Transformer encoder, for spatial feature extraction. We further extend recent State Space Models (SSMs), known as the Mamba model, into a Bidirectional Temporal Mamba (BTM) to better capture temporal dependencies. Additionally, we incorporate a Bidirectional Temporal Scaled (BTS) module to thoroughly scan trajectories while preserving temporal missing relationships. Furthermore, we curate and benchmark three practical sports datasets, Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U, for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our model. We hope that our work can advance the understanding of human movement in real-world applications, particularly in sports.

| **[Partially Observed Trajectory Inference using Optimal Transport and a Dynamics Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07475v3)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory inference seeks to recover the temporal dynamics of a population from snapshots of its (uncoupled) temporal marginals, i.e. where observed particles are not tracked over time. Prior works addressed this challenging problem under a stochastic differential equation (SDE) model with a gradient-driven drift in the observed space, introducing a minimum entropy estimator relative to the Wiener measure and a practical grid-free mean-field Langevin (MFL) algorithm using Schr\"odinger bridges. Motivated by the success of observable state space models in the traditional paired trajectory inference problem (e.g. target tracking), we extend the above framework to a class of latent SDEs in the form of observable state space models. In this setting, we use partial observations to infer trajectories in the latent space under a specified dynamics model (e.g. the constant velocity/acceleration models from target tracking). We introduce the PO-MFL algorithm to solve this latent trajectory inference problem and provide theoretical guarantees to the partially observed setting. Experiments validate the robustness of our method and the exponential convergence of the MFL dynamics, and demonstrate significant outperformance over the latent-free baseline in key scenarios.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Due to the potentially long distance of the UAV's flight, frequent handovers may be incurred among different GBSs, which leads to various practical issues such as large delay and synchronization overhead. To address this problem, we investigate the trajectory optimization of the UAV to minimize the number of GBS handovers during the flight, subject to a communication quality constraint and a maximum mission completion time constraint. Although this problem is non-convex and difficult to solve, we derive useful structures of the optimal solution, based on which we propose an efficient algorithm based on graph theory and Lagrangian relaxation for finding a high-quality suboptimal solution in polynomial time. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed trajectory design.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in IEEE Wireless Communications Letters</p></details> |

Unlike competing-event models, the events here are not mutually exclusive and often exhibit statistical dependencies. Existing approaches for multi-event survival analysis have generally been limited, most focusing on producing simple risk scores for each event, rather than the time-to-event itself. To overcome these issues, we introduce MENSA, a novel deep learning approach for multi-event survival analysis. MENSA jointly learns representations of the input features while capturing the complex dependence structure among events. In practice, it attempts to optimize the sum of the traditional negative log-likelihood across events and a novel trajectory-based likelihood, which encourages the model to learn the temporal order in which events occur. Experiments on real-world clinical datasets show that MENSA consistently gives good discrimination performances and accurate time-to-event predictions in single-event, competing-risk, and multi-event problems. Additionally, MENSA is more computationally-efficient, requiring fewer parameters and FLOPs than multiple state-of-the-art survival baselines when applied to large-dimensional datasets (more than 100 features).</p></details> |  |

Such environments contain rich features like crosswalks, grass, and curbs, which are easily interpretable by humans, but not by mobile robots. We aim to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating on crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We develop a visual prompting approach and leverage the Visual Language Model's (VLM) zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our method in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe an average improvement of 20.81% in satisfying traversability constraints and 28.51% in terms of human-like navigation in four different outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, adjusting specific elements in generated videos, such as object motion or camera movement, is often a tedious process of trial and error, e.g., involving re-generating videos with different random seeds. Recent techniques address this issue by fine-tuning a pre-trained model to follow conditioning signals, such as bounding boxes or point trajectories. Yet, this fine-tuning procedure can be computationally expensive, and it requires datasets with annotated object motion, which can be difficult to procure. In this work, we introduce SG-I2V, a framework for controllable image-to-video generation that is self-guided$\unicode{x2013}$offering zero-shot control by relying solely on the knowledge present in a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model without the need for fine-tuning or external knowledge.

Exiting efforts focus on single-frame cooperative perception, however, how to capture the temporal cue between frames with V2X to facilitate the prediction task even the planning task is still underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the Co-MTP, a general cooperative trajectory prediction framework with multi-temporal fusion for autonomous driving, which leverages the V2X system to fully capture the interaction among agents in both history and future domains to benefit the planning. In the history domain, V2X can complement the incomplete history trajectory in single-vehicle perception, and we design a heterogeneous graph transformer to learn the fusion of the history feature from multiple agents and capture the history interaction. Moreover, the goal of prediction is to support future planning. Thus, in the future domain, V2X can provide the prediction results of surrounding objects, and we further extend the graph transformer to capture the future interaction among the ego planning and the other vehicles' intentions and obtain the final future scenario state under a certain planning action. We evaluate the Co-MTP framework on the real-world dataset V2X-Seq, and the results show that Co-MTP achieves state-of-the-art performance and that both history and future fusion can greatly benefit prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, ICRA 2025</p></details> |

| **[Patient Trajectory Prediction: Integrating Clinical Notes with Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18009v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting disease trajectories from electronic health records (EHRs) is a complex task due to major challenges such as data non-stationarity, high granularity of medical codes, and integration of multimodal data. EHRs contain both structured data, such as diagnostic codes, and unstructured data, such as clinical notes, which hold essential information often overlooked. Current models, primarily based on structured data, struggle to capture the complete medical context of patients, resulting in a loss of valuable information. To address this issue, we propose an approach that integrates unstructured clinical notes into transformer-based deep learning models for sequential disease prediction. This integration enriches the representation of patients' medical histories, thereby improving the accuracy of diagnosis predictions. Experiments on MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional models relying solely on structured data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quadrotor Neural Dead Reckoning in Periodic Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17964v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real world scenarios, due to environmental or hardware constraints, the quadrotor is forced to navigate in pure inertial navigation mode while operating indoors or outdoors. To mitigate inertial drift, end-to-end neural network approaches combined with quadrotor periodic trajectories were suggested. There, the quadrotor distance is regressed and combined with inertial model-based heading estimation, the quadrotor position vector is estimated. To further enhance positioning performance, in this paper we propose a quadrotor neural dead reckoning approach for quadrotors flying on periodic trajectories. In this case, the inertial readings are fed into a simple and efficient network to directly estimate the quadrotor position vector. Our approach was evaluated on two different quadrotors, one operating indoors while the other outdoors. Our approach improves the positioning accuracy of other deep-learning approaches, achieving an average 27% reduction in error outdoors and an average 79% reduction indoors, while requiring only software modifications. With the improved positioning accuracy achieved by our method, the quadrotor can seamlessly perform its tasks.</p></details> |  |

The base transcription algorithm for which we establish the refinement algorithm is a direct multiple shooting technique -- $\mathsf{QuITO}$ $\textsf{v.2}$ (Quasi-Interpolation based Trajectory Optimization). The mesh refinement technique consists of two steps -- localization of certain irregular regions in an optimal control trajectory via wavelets, followed by a targeted $h$-refinement approach around such regions of irregularity. Theoretical approximation guarantees on uniform grids are presented for optimal controls with certain regularity properties, along with guarantees of localization of change points by wavelet transform. Numerical illustrations are provided for control profiles involving discontinuities to show the effectiveness of the localization and refinement strategy.

| **[Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Trajectory Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15429v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning safe behaviors without engaging in risky online interactions with the environment. Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[TraFlow: Trajectory Distillation on Pre-Trained Rectified Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16972v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Majorities of distillation methods on pre-trained diffusion models or on pre-trained rectified flow, focus on either the distillation outputs or the trajectories between random noises and clean images to speed up sample generations from pre-trained models. In those trajectory-based distillation methods, consistency distillation requires the self-consistent trajectory projection to regulate the trajectory, which might avoid the common ODE approximation error {while still be concerning about sampling efficiencies}. At the same time, rectified flow distillations enforce straight trajectory for fast sampling, although an ODE solver is still required. In this work, we propose a trajectory distillation method, \modelname, that enjoys the benefits of both and enables few-step generations. TraFlow adopts the settings of consistency trajectory models, and further enforces the properties of self-consistency and straightness throughout the entire trajectory. These two properties are pursued by reaching a balance with following three targets: (1) reconstruct the output from pre-trained models; (2) learn the amount of changes by pre-trained models; (3) satisfy the self-consistency over its trajectory. Extensive experimental results have shown the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Finite-Time Sliding Mode Control for Chattering-Free Trajectory Tracking of Robotic Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16867v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving precise and efficient trajectory tracking in robotic arms remains a key challenge due to system uncertainties and chattering effects in conventional sliding mode control (SMC). This paper presents a chattering-free fast terminal sliding mode control (FTSMC) strategy for a three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) robotic arm, designed to enhance tracking accuracy and robustness while ensuring finite-time convergence. The control framework is developed using Newton-Euler dynamics, followed by a state-space representation that captures the system's angular position and velocity. By incorporating an improved sliding surface and a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, the proposed FTSMC effectively mitigates chattering while preserving the advantages of SMC, such as fast response and strong disturbance rejection. The controller's performance is rigorously evaluated through comparisons with conventional PD sliding mode control (PDSMC) and terminal sliding mode control (TSMC). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior trajectory tracking performance, faster convergence, and enhanced stability compared to existing methods, making it a promising solution for high-precision robotic applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Characterizing Structured versus Unstructured Environments based on Pedestrians' and Vehicles' Motion Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16847v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory behaviours of pedestrians and vehicles operating close to each other can be different in unstructured compared to structured environments. These differences in the motion behaviour are valuable to be considered in the trajectory prediction algorithm of an autonomous vehicle. However, the available datasets on pedestrians' and vehicles' trajectories that are commonly used as benchmarks for trajectory prediction have not been classified based on the nature of their environment. On the other hand, the definitions provided for unstructured and structured environments are rather qualitative and hard to be used for justifying the type of a given environment. In this paper, we have compared different existing datasets based on a couple of extracted trajectory features, such as mean speed and trajectory variability. Through K-means clustering and generalized linear models, we propose more quantitative measures for distinguishing the two different types of environments. Our results show that features such as trajectory variability, stop fraction and density of pedestrians are different among the two environmental types and can be used to classify the existing datasets.</p></details> |  |

While recent research demonstrates the applicability of diffusion models to OOD detection, existing approaches are limited to Euclidean or latent image spaces. Our work extends OOD detection to trajectories in the Special Euclidean Group in 3D ($\mathbb{SE}(3)$), addressing a critical need in computer vision, robotics, and engineering applications that process object pose sequences in $\mathbb{SE}(3)$. We present $\textbf{D}$iffusion-based $\textbf{O}$ut-of-distribution detection on $\mathbb{SE}(3)$ ($\mathbf{DOSE3}$), a novel OOD framework that extends diffusion to a unified sample space of $\mathbb{SE}(3)$ pose sequences. Through extensive validation on multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate $\mathbf{DOSE3}$'s superior performance compared to state-of-the-art OOD detection frameworks.</p></details> |  |

Reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning schemes face issues of low search efficiency and learning instability when optimizing large-scale systems. To address these issues, we present an Attention-based UAV Trajectory Optimization (AUTO) framework based on the graph transformer, which consists of an Attention Trajectory Optimization Model (ATOM) and a Trajectory lEarNing Method based on Actor-critic (TENMA). In ATOM, a graph encoder is used to calculate the self-attention characteristics of all IoTDs, and a trajectory decoder is developed to optimize the number and trajectories of UAVs. TENMA then trains the ATOM using an improved Actor-Critic method, in which the real reward of the system is applied as the baseline to reduce variances in the critic network. This method is suitable for high-quality and large-scale multi-UAV trajectory planning. Finally, we develop numerous experiments, including a hardware experiment in the field case, to verify the feasibility and efficiency of the AUTO framework.</p></details> |  |

However, existing datasets often suffer from limited scale diversity and inaccurate annotations, hindering robust model development. This paper introduces UAVDB, a high-resolution UAV detection dataset constructed using Patch Intensity Convergence (PIC). This novel technique automatically generates high-fidelity bounding box annotations from UAV trajectory data~\cite{li2020reconstruction}, eliminating the need for manual labeling. UAVDB features single-class annotations with a fixed-camera setup and consists of RGB frames capturing UAVs across various scales, from large-scale UAVs to near-single-pixel representations, along with challenging backgrounds that pose difficulties for modern detectors. We first validate the accuracy and efficiency of PIC-generated bounding boxes by comparing Intersection over Union (IoU) performance and runtime against alternative annotation methods, demonstrating that PIC achieves higher annotation accuracy while being more efficient. Subsequently, we benchmark UAVDB using state-of-the-art (SOTA) YOLO-series detectors, establishing UAVDB as a valuable resource for advancing long-range and high-resolution UAV detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Different from the classical state space model, our series of studies, including this paper, model the collection of the target state as a stochastic process (SP) that is further decomposed into a deterministic part which represents the trend of the trajectory and a residual SP representing the residual fitting error. Subsequently, the tracking problem is formulated as a learning problem regarding the trajectory SP for which a key part is to estimate a trajectory FoT (T-FoT) best fitting the measurements in time series. For this purpose, we consider the polynomial T-FoT and address the regularized polynomial T-FoT optimization employing two distinct regularization strategies seeking trade-off between the accuracy and simplicity. One limits the order of the polynomial and then the best choice is determined by grid searching in a narrow, bounded range while the other adopts $\ell_0$ norm regularization for which the hybrid Newton solver is employed. Simulation results obtained in both single and multiple maneuvering target scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Part ...</summary><p>Part II of a series of companion papers; 11 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing PPO with Trajectory-Aware Hybrid Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15968v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proximal policy optimization (PPO) is one of the most popular state-of-the-art on-policy algorithms that has become a standard baseline in modern reinforcement learning with applications in numerous fields. Though it delivers stable performance with theoretical policy improvement guarantees, high variance, and high sample complexity still remain critical challenges in on-policy algorithms. To alleviate these issues, we propose Hybrid-Policy Proximal Policy Optimization (HP3O), which utilizes a trajectory replay buffer to make efficient use of trajectories generated by recent policies. Particularly, the buffer applies the "first in, first out" (FIFO) strategy so as to keep only the recent trajectories to attenuate the data distribution drift. A batch consisting of the trajectory with the best return and other randomly sampled ones from the buffer is used for updating the policy networks. The strategy helps the agent to improve its capability on top of the most recent best performance and in turn reduce variance empirically. We theoretically construct the policy improvement guarantees for the proposed algorithm. HP3O is validated and compared against several baseline algorithms using multiple continuous control environments. Our code is available here.</p></details> |  |

It is classified into pedestrian or heterogeneous trajectory prediction. The former exploits the relatively consistent behavior of pedestrians, but is limited in real-world scenarios with heterogeneous traffic agents such as cyclists and vehicles. The latter typically relies on extra class label information to distinguish the heterogeneous agents, but such labels are costly to annotate and cannot be generalized to represent different behaviors within the same class of agents. In this work, we introduce the behavioral pseudo-labels that effectively capture the behavior distributions of pedestrians and heterogeneous agents solely based on their motion features, significantly improving the accuracy of trajectory prediction. To implement the framework, we propose the Behavioral Pseudo-Label Informed Sparse Graph Convolution Network (BP-SGCN) that learns pseudo-labels and informs to a trajectory predictor. For optimization, we propose a cascaded training scheme, in which we first learn the pseudo-labels in an unsupervised manner, and then perform end-to-end fine-tuning on the labels in the direction of increasing the trajectory prediction accuracy. Experiments show that our pseudo-labels effectively model different behavior clusters and improve trajectory prediction. Our proposed BP-SGCN outperforms existing methods using both pedestrian (ETH/UCY, pedestrian-only SDD) and heterogeneous agent datasets (SDD, Argoverse 1).</p></details> |  |
| **[A View of the Certainty-Equivalence Method for PAC RL as an Application of the Trajectory Tree Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02652v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) enables an agent interacting with an unknown MDP $M$ to optimise its behaviour by observing transitions sampled from $M$. A natural entity that emerges in the agent's reasoning is $\widehat{M}$, the maximum likelihood estimate of $M$ based on the observed transitions. The well-known \textit{certainty-equivalence} method (CEM) dictates that the agent update its behaviour to $\widehat{\pi}$, which is an optimal policy for $\widehat{M}$. Not only is CEM intuitive, it has been shown to enjoy minimax-optimal sample complexity in some regions of the parameter space for PAC RL with a generative model~\citep{Agarwal2020GenModel}. A seemingly unrelated algorithm is the ``trajectory tree method'' (TTM)~\citep{Kearns+MN:1999}, originally developed for efficient decision-time planning in large POMDPs. This paper presents a theoretical investigation that stems from the surprising finding that CEM may indeed be viewed as an application of TTM. The qualitative benefits of this view are (1) new and simple proofs of sample complexity upper bounds for CEM, in fact under a (2) weaker assumption on the rewards than is prevalent in the current literature. Our analysis applies to both non-stationary and stationary MDPs. Quantitatively, we obtain (3) improvements in the sample-complexity upper bounds for CEM both for non-stationary and stationary MDPs, in the regime that the ``mistake probability'' $\delta$ is small. Additionally, we show (4) a lower bound on the sample complexity for finite-horizon MDPs, which establishes the minimax-optimality of our upper bound for non-stationary MDPs in the small-$\delta$ regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, excluding references and appendices.

Recently, two important approaches have gained recognition. While one leverages via-points to adapt skills locally by modulating demonstrated trajectories, another relies on so-called task-parameterized models that encode movements with respect to different coordinate systems, using a product of probabilities for generalization. While the former are well-suited to precise, local modulations, the latter aim at generalizing over large regions of the workspace and often involve multiple objects. Addressing the quality of generalization by leveraging both approaches simultaneously has received little attention. In this work, we propose an interactive imitation learning framework that simultaneously leverages local and global modulations of trajectory distributions. Building on the kernelized movement primitives (KMP) framework, we introduce novel mechanisms for skill modulation from direct human corrective feedback. Our approach particularly exploits the concept of via-points to incrementally and interactively 1) improve the model accuracy locally, 2) add new objects to the task during execution and 3) extend the skill into regions where demonstrations were not provided. We evaluate our method on a bearing ring-loading task using a torque-controlled, 7-DoF, DLR SARA robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L), 16 pages, 19 figures, 6 tables.

| **[From Text to Trajectory: Exploring Complex Constraint Representation and Decomposition in Safe Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08920v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe reinforcement learning (RL) requires the agent to finish a given task while obeying specific constraints. Giving constraints in natural language form has great potential for practical scenarios due to its flexible transfer capability and accessibility. Previous safe RL methods with natural language constraints typically need to design cost functions manually for each constraint, which requires domain expertise and lacks flexibility. In this paper, we harness the dual role of text in this task, using it not only to provide constraint but also as a training signal. We introduce the Trajectory-level Textual Constraints Translator (TTCT) to replace the manually designed cost function. Our empirical results demonstrate that TTCT effectively comprehends textual constraint and trajectory, and the policies trained by TTCT can achieve a lower violation rate than the standard cost function. Extra studies are conducted to demonstrate that the TTCT has zero-shot transfer capability to adapt to constraint-shift environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Real-Time Moving Flock Detection in Pedestrian Trajectories Using Sequential Deep Learning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15252v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding collective pedestrian movement is crucial for applications in crowd management, autonomous navigation, and human-robot interaction. This paper investigates the use of sequential deep learning models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformers, for real-time flock detection in multi-pedestrian trajectories. Our proposed approach consists of a two-stage process: first, a pre-trained binary classification model is used for pairwise trajectory classification, and second, the learned representations are applied to identify multi-agent flocks dynamically. We validate our method using real-world group movement datasets, demonstrating its robustness across varying sequence lengths and diverse movement patterns. Experimental results indicate that our model consistently detects pedestrian flocks with high accuracy and stability, even in dynamic and noisy environments. Furthermore, we extend our approach to identify other forms of collective motion, such as convoys and swarms, paving the way for more comprehensive multi-agent behavior analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[DDAT: Diffusion Policies Enforcing Dynamically Admissible Robot Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15043v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel at creating images and videos thanks to their multimodal generative capabilities. These same capabilities have made diffusion models increasingly popular in robotics research, where they are used for generating robot motion. However, the stochastic nature of diffusion models is fundamentally at odds with the precise dynamical equations describing the feasible motion of robots. Hence, generating dynamically admissible robot trajectories is a challenge for diffusion models. To alleviate this issue, we introduce DDAT: Diffusion policies for Dynamically Admissible Trajectories to generate provably admissible trajectories of black-box robotic systems using diffusion models. A sequence of states is a dynamically admissible trajectory if each state of the sequence belongs to the reachable set of its predecessor by the robot's equations of motion. To generate such trajectories, our diffusion policies project their predictions onto a dynamically admissible manifold during both training and inference to align the objective of the denoiser neural network with the dynamical admissibility constraint. The auto-regressive nature of these projections along with the black-box nature of robot dynamics render these projections immensely challenging. We thus enforce admissibility by iteratively sampling a polytopic under-approximation of the reachable set of a state onto which we project its predicted successor, before iterating this process with the projected successor. By producing accurate trajectories, this projection eliminates the need for diffusion models to continually replan, enabling one-shot long-horizon trajectory planning. We demonstrate that our framework generates higher quality dynamically admissible robot trajectories through extensive simulations on a quadcopter and various MuJoCo environments, along with real-world experiments on a Unitree GO1 and GO2.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Finding Complex Patterns in Trajectory Data via Geometric Set Cover](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14865v2)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clustering trajectories is a central challenge when faced with large amounts of movement data such as GPS data. We study a clustering problem that can be stated as a geometric set cover problem: Given a polygonal curve of complexity $n$, find the smallest number $k$ of representative trajectories of complexity at most $l$ such that any point on the input trajectories lies on a subtrajectory of the input that has Fr\'echet distance at most $\Delta$ to one of the representative trajectories. In previous work, Br\"uning et al.~(2022) developed a bicriteria approximation algorithm that returns a set of curves of size $O(kl\log(kl))$ which covers the input with a radius of $11\Delta$ in time $\widetilde{O}((kl)^2n + kln^3)$, where $k$ is the smallest number of curves of complexity $l$ needed to cover the input with a radius of $\Delta$. The representative trajectories computed by this algorithm are always line segments. In the applications however, one is usually interested in more complex representative curves which consist of several edges. We present a new approach that builds upon previous work computing a set of curves of size $O(k\log(n))$ in time $\widetilde{O}(l^2n^4 + kln^4)$ with the same distance guarantee of $11\Delta$, where each curve may consist of curves of complexity up to the given complexity parameter~$l$. We conduct experiments on tracking data of ocean currents and full body motion data suggesting its validity as a tool for analyzing large spatio-temporal data sets.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Target Tracking to Targeting Track -- Part I: A Metric for Spatio-Temporal Trajectory Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15842v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of target tracking, performance evaluation plays a pivotal role in the design, comparison, and analytics of trackers. Compared with the traditional trajectory composed of a set of point-estimates obtained by a tracker in the measurement time-series, the trajectory that our series of studies including this paper pursued is given by a curve function of time (FoT). The trajectory FoT provides complete information of the movement of the target over time and can be used to infer the state corresponding to arbitrary time, not only at the measurement time. However, there are no metrics available for comparing and evaluating the trajectory FoT. To address this lacuna, we propose a metric denominated as the spatiotemporal-aligned trajectory integral distance (Star-ID). The StarID associates and aligns the estimated and actual trajectories in the spatio-temporal domain and distinguishes between the time-aligned and unaligned segments in calculating the spatial divergence including false alarm, miss-detection and localization errors. The effectiveness of the proposed distance metric and the time-averaged version is validated through theoretical analysis and numerical examples of a single target or multiple targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Part ...</summary><p>Part I of a series of companion papers; 11 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

In practice, however, MPPI often struggles to guarantee safety assurance and balance efficient sampling in open spaces with the need for more extensive exploration under tight constraints. To address this challenge, we incorporate discrete barrier states (DBaS) into MPPI and propose a novel MPPI-DBaS algorithm that ensures system safety and enables adaptive exploration across diverse scenarios. We evaluate our method in simulation experiments where the vehicle navigates through closely placed obstacles. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms standard MPPI, achieving a higher success rate and lower tracking errors.</p></details> | CCC 2025 |
| **[STeCa: Step-level Trajectory Calibration for LLM Agent Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14276v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-based agents have shown promise in tackling complex tasks by interacting dynamically with the environment. Existing work primarily focuses on behavior cloning from expert demonstrations and preference learning through exploratory trajectory sampling. However, these methods often struggle in long-horizon tasks, where suboptimal actions accumulate step by step, causing agents to deviate from correct task trajectories. To address this, we highlight the importance of timely calibration and the need to automatically construct calibration trajectories for training agents. We propose Step-Level Trajectory Calibration (STeCa), a novel framework for LLM agent learning. Specifically, STeCa identifies suboptimal actions through a step-level reward comparison during exploration. It constructs calibrated trajectories using LLM-driven reflection, enabling agents to learn from improved decision-making processes. These calibrated trajectories, together with successful trajectory data, are utilized for reinforced training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STeCa significantly outperforms existing methods. Further analysis highlights that step-level calibration enables agents to complete tasks with greater robustness. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/WangHanLinHenry/STeCa.</p></details> |  |

The proposed framework leverages the potential of the complementarity constraint as a decision-maker and an indicator for diverse cooperative tasks and extends it to the collaborative landing scenario. In a potential application of the proposed methodology, a ground mobile robot may serve as a mobile charging station and coordinates in real-time with a quadrotor to be charged, facilitating a safe and efficient rendezvous and landing. We verified the generated trajectories in simulation and real-world applications, demonstrating the real-time capabilities of the proposed landing planning framework.</p></details> |  |

The key challenge lies in leveraging latent spatiotemporal correlations within RSS data while navigating complex road networks. To address this, we develop a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based RSS embedding (HRE) technique that employs alternating optimization to infer vehicle trajectories from RSS measurements. This model captures spatiotemporal dependencies while a road graph ensures network compliance. Additionally, we introduce a maximum speed-constrained rough trajectory estimation (MSR) method to guide the optimization process, enabling rapid convergence to a favorable local solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explorer: Scaling Exploration-driven Web Trajectory Synthesis for Multimodal Web Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11357v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent success in large multimodal models (LMMs) has sparked promising applications of agents capable of autonomously completing complex web tasks. While open-source LMM agents have made significant advances in offline evaluation benchmarks, their performance still falls substantially short of human-level capabilities in more realistic online settings. A key bottleneck is the lack of diverse and large-scale trajectory-level datasets across various domains, which are expensive to collect. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing a scalable recipe to synthesize the largest and most diverse trajectory-level dataset to date, containing over 94K successful multimodal web trajectories, spanning 49K unique URLs, 720K screenshots, and 33M web elements. In particular, we leverage extensive web exploration and refinement to obtain diverse task intents. The average cost is 28 cents per successful trajectory, making it affordable to a wide range of users in the community. Leveraging this dataset, we train Explorer, a multimodal web agent, and demonstrate strong performance on both offline and online web agent benchmarks such as Mind2Web-Live, Multimodal-Mind2Web, and MiniWob++. Additionally, our experiments highlight data scaling as a key driver for improving web agent capabilities. We hope this study makes state-of-the-art LMM-based agent research at a larger scale more accessible.</p></details> | 24 pages, 7 figures |
| **[BoundPlanner: A convex-set-based approach to bounded manipulator trajectory planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13286v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online trajectory planning enables robot manipulators to react quickly to changing environments or tasks. Many robot trajectory planners exist for known environments but are often too slow for online computations. Current methods in online trajectory planning do not find suitable trajectories in challenging scenarios that respect the limits of the robot and account for collisions. This work proposes a trajectory planning framework consisting of the novel Cartesian path planner based on convex sets, called BoundPlanner, and the online trajectory planner BoundMPC. BoundPlanner explores and maps the collision-free space using convex sets to compute a reference path with bounds. BoundMPC is extended in this work to handle convex sets for path deviations, which allows the robot to optimally follow the path within the bounds while accounting for the robot's kinematics. Collisions of the robot's kinematic chain are considered by a novel convex-set-based collision avoidance formulation independent on the number of obstacles. Simulations and experiments with a 7-DoF manipulator show the performance of the proposed planner compared to state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at github.com/Thieso/BoundPlanner and videos of the experiments can be found at www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/42d4</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Our vehicle simulator efficiently models vehicle motion, generating trajectories that can be supervised to fit real-world data. By leveraging its differentiable nature, IDM parameters are optimized using gradient-based methods. With the capability to simulate up to 2 million vehicles in real time, the system is scalable for large-scale trajectory optimization. We show that we can use the simulator to filter noise in the input trajectories (trajectory filtering), reconstruct dense trajectories from sparse ones (trajectory reconstruction), and predict future trajectories (trajectory prediction), with all generated trajectories adhering to physical laws. We validate our simulator and algorithm on several datasets including NGSIM and Waymo Open Dataset.

To address this challenge, and reduce the risk of disrupting operations, we leverage recent advances in Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) to develop a neural state-space model (NSSM) that predicts plasma dynamics during Tokamak \`a Configuration Variable (TCV) rampdowns. By integrating simple physics structure and data-driven models, the NSSM efficiently learns plasma dynamics during the rampdown from a modest dataset of 311 pulses with only five pulses in the reactor relevant high performance regime. The NSSM is parallelized across uncertainties, and reinforcement learning (RL) is applied to design trajectories that avoid multiple instability limits with high probability. Experiments at TCV ramping down high performance plasmas show statistically significant improvements in current and energy at plasma termination, with improvements in speed through continuous re-training. A predict-first experiment, increasing plasma current by 20\% from baseline, demonstrates the NSSM's ability to make small extrapolations with sufficient accuracy to design trajectories that successfully terminate the pulse. The developed approach paves the way for designing tokamak controls with robustness to considerable uncertainty, and demonstrates the relevance of the SciML approach to learning plasma dynamics for rapidly developing robust trajectories and controls during the incremental campaigns of upcoming burning plasma tokamaks.</p></details> |  |

Existing RL-based fine-tuning methods focus on single training timesteps and neglect trajectory-level alignment, while recent sampling trajectory optimization methods incur significant inference NFE costs. Diffusion-Sharpening overcomes this by using a path integral framework to select optimal trajectories during training, leveraging reward feedback, and amortizing inference costs. Our method demonstrates superior training efficiency with faster convergence, and best inference efficiency without requiring additional NFEs. Extensive experiments show that Diffusion-Sharpening outperforms RL-based fine-tuning methods (e.g., Diffusion-DPO) and sampling trajectory optimization methods (e.g., Inference Scaling) across diverse metrics including text alignment, compositional capabilities, and human preferences, offering a scalable and efficient solution for future diffusion model fine-tuning.

| **[Leader and Follower: Interactive Motion Generation under Trajectory Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11563v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of game and film production, generating interactive motion from texts has garnered significant attention due to its potential to revolutionize content creation processes. In many practical applications, there is a need to impose strict constraints on the motion range or trajectory of virtual characters. However, existing methods that rely solely on textual input face substantial challenges in accurately capturing the user's intent, particularly in specifying the desired trajectory. As a result, the generated motions often lack plausibility and accuracy. Moreover, existing trajectory - based methods for customized motion generation rely on retraining for single - actor scenarios, which limits flexibility and adaptability to different datasets, as well as interactivity in two-actor motions. To generate interactive motion following specified trajectories, this paper decouples complex motion into a Leader - Follower dynamic, inspired by role allocation in partner dancing. Based on this framework, this paper explores the motion range refinement process in interactive motion generation and proposes a training-free approach, integrating a Pace Controller and a Kinematic Synchronization Adapter. The framework enhances the ability of existing models to generate motion that adheres to trajectory by controlling the leader's movement and correcting the follower's motion to align with the leader. Experimental results show that the proposed approach, by better leveraging trajectory information, outperforms existing methods in both realism and accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Such a system of $[0,1]$-valued piecewise linear trajectories arises as a scaling limit of the system of logarithmic subpopulation sizes in a certain population-genetic model (more precisely, a Moran model) with mutation and selection. By definition, the resident fitness is initially 0 and afterwards it increases by the ultimate slope of each trajectory that reaches height 1. We show that although the interaction of $n$ trajectories may yield $\Omega(n^2)$ slope changes in total, the resident fitness (at all times) can be computed algorithmically in $O(n)$ time. Our algorithm is given in terms of the so-called continued lines representation of the system of interacting trajectories. In the special case of Poissonian interacting trajectories where the birth times of the trajectories form a Poisson process and the initial slopes are random and i.i.d., we show that even the expected number of slope changes grows only linearly in time.</p></details> |  |

However, accurate position data of a target mobile device, typically obtained from global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), cellular networks, or WiFi, may not always be accessible to first responders. For instance, 1) accuracy and availability can be limited in challenging signal reception environments, and 2) in regions where emergency location services are not mandatory, certain mobile devices may not transmit their location during emergencies. As an alternative localization method, a network of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be employed to passively locate targets by collecting radio frequency (RF) signal measurements, such as received signal strength (RSS). In these situations, UAV trajectories play a critical role in localization performance, influencing both accuracy and search time. Previous studies optimized UAV trajectories using the determinant of the Fisher information matrix (FIM), but its performance declines under unfavorable geometric conditions, such as when UAVs start from a single base, leading to position ambiguity. To address this, our prior work introduced a rigidity-based approach, which improved the search time compared to FIM-based methods in our simulation case. However, the high computational cost of rigidity-based optimization, primarily due to singular value decomposition (SVD), limits its practicality. In this paper, we applied techniques to reduce computational complexity, including randomized SVD, smooth SVD, and vertex pruning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ION ITM 2025</p></details> |

Past research relied on incorporating deterministic future states of surrounding pedestrians which can be overconfident leading to unsafe robot behaviour. The current paper proposes a predictive uncertainty-aware planner that integrates neural network based probabilistic trajectory prediction into planning. Our method uses a deep ensemble based network for probabilistic forecasting of surrounding humans and integrates the predictive uncertainty as constraints into the planner. We compare numerous constraint satisfaction methods on the planner and evaluated its performance on real world pedestrian datasets. Further, offline robot navigation was carried out on out-of-distribution pedestrian trajectories inside a narrow corridor</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Trajectory-guided Policy for Long-horizon Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10040v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Vision-Language-Action models (VLA) have advanced robot imitation learning, but high data collection costs and limited demonstrations hinder generalization and current imitation learning methods struggle in out-of-distribution scenarios, especially for long-horizon tasks. A key challenge is how to mitigate compounding errors in imitation learning, which lead to cascading failures over extended trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose the Diffusion Trajectory-guided Policy (DTP) framework, which generates 2D trajectories through a diffusion model to guide policy learning for long-horizon tasks. By leveraging task-relevant trajectories, DTP provides trajectory-level guidance to reduce error accumulation. Our two-stage approach first trains a generative vision-language model to create diffusion-based trajectories, then refines the imitation policy using them. Experiments on the CALVIN benchmark show that DTP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 25% in success rate, starting from scratch without external pretraining. Moreover, DTP significantly improves real-world robot performance.</p></details> |  |

Without loosing any information, we associate to each state a binary random function, taking values in $\{0,1\}$, and turn the problem of statistical modeling of a categorical process into a multivariate functional data analysis issue. The (multivariate) covariance operator has nice interpretations in terms of departure from independence of the joint probabilities and the multivariate functional principal components are simple to interpret. Under the weak hypothesis assuming only continuity in probability of the $0-1$ trajectories, it is simple to build consistent estimators of the covariance kernel and perform multivariate functional principal components analysis. The sample paths being piecewise constant, with a finite number of jumps, this a rare case in functional data analysis in which the trajectories can be observed exhaustively. The approach is illustrated on a data set of sensory perceptions, considering different gustometer-controlled stimuli experiments. We show how it can be easily extended to analyze experiments, such as temporal check-all-that-apply, in which two states or more can be observed at the same time.</p></details> |  |

We frame this problem as an instance of abduction guided by a novel parsimony function represented as an aggregate truth value over an annotated logic program. This approach has the added benefit of affording explainability to an analyst user. By showing that any subset of such a program can provide a lower bound on this parsimony requirement, we are able to abduce movement trajectories efficiently through an informed (i.e., A*) search. We describe how our implementation was enhanced with the application of multiple techniques in order to be scaled and integrated with a cloud-based software stack that included bottom-up rule learning, geolocated knowledge graph retrieval/management, and interfaces with government systems for independently conducted government-run tests for which we provide results. We also report on our own experiments showing that we not only provide exact results but also scale to very large scenarios and provide realistic agent trajectories that can go undetected by machine learning anomaly detectors.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ICLP 2024, arXiv:2502.08453</p></details> |

However, due to the highly dynamic and multimodal nature of the task, accurately predicting the future trajectory of a target vehicle remains a significant challenge. To address this challenge, we propose an Ego vehicle Planning-informed Network (EPN) for multimodal trajectory prediction. In real-world driving, the future trajectory of a vehicle is influenced not only by its own historical trajectory, but also by the behavior of other vehicles. So, we incorporate the future planned trajectory of the ego vehicle as an additional input to simulate the mutual influence between vehicles. Furthermore, to tackle the challenges of intention ambiguity and large prediction errors often encountered in methods based on driving intentions, we propose an endpoint prediction module for the target vehicle. This module predicts the target vehicle endpoints, refines them using a correction mechanism, and generates a multimodal predicted trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that EPN achieves an average reduction of 34.9%, 30.7%, and 30.4% in RMSE, ADE, and FDE on the NGSIM dataset, and an average reduction of 64.6%, 64.5%, and 64.3% in RMSE, ADE, and FDE on the HighD dataset.

One-step diffusion models generate high-quality images in a one sampling step, greatly reducing computational overhead and inference latency. However, most existing one-step diffusion methods are constrained by the performance of the teacher model, where poor teacher performance results in image artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose FluxSR, a novel one-step diffusion Real-ISR technique based on flow matching models. We use the state-of-the-art diffusion model FLUX.1-dev as both the teacher model and the base model. First, we introduce Flow Trajectory Distillation (FTD) to distill a multi-step flow matching model into a one-step Real-ISR. Second, to improve image realism and address high-frequency artifact issues in generated images, we propose TV-LPIPS as a perceptual loss and introduce Attention Diversification Loss (ADL) as a regularization term to reduce token similarity in transformer, thereby eliminating high-frequency artifacts.

| **[Investigating Vulnerabilities of GPS Trip Data to Trajectory-User Linking Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08217v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open human mobility data is considered an essential basis for the profound research and analysis required for the transition to sustainable mobility and sustainable urban planning. Cycling data has especially been the focus of data collection endeavors in recent years. Although privacy risks regarding location data are widely known, practitioners often refrain from advanced privacy mechanisms to prevent utility losses. Removing user identifiers from trips is thereby deemed a major privacy gain, as it supposedly prevents linking single trips to obtain entire movement patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel attack to reconstruct user identifiers in GPS trip datasets consisting of single trips, unlike previous ones that are dedicated to evaluating trajectory-user linking in the context of check-in data. We evaluate the remaining privacy risk for users in such datasets and our empirical findings from two real-world datasets show that the risk of re-identification is significant even when personal identifiers have been removed, and that truncation as a simple additional privacy mechanism may not be effective in protecting user privacy. Further investigations indicate that users who frequently visit locations that are only visited by a small number of others, tend to be more vulnerable to re-identification.</p></details> | 32 pages, 15 figures |
| **[RouteFlow: Trajectory-Aware Animated Transitions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08076v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Animating objects' movements is widely used to facilitate tracking changes and observing both the global trend and local hotspots where objects converge or diverge. Existing methods, however, often obscure critical local hotspots by only considering the start and end positions of objects' trajectories. To address this gap, we propose RouteFlow, a trajectory-aware animated transition method that effectively balances the global trend and local hotspots while minimizing occlusion. RouteFlow is inspired by a real-world bus route analogy: objects are regarded as passengers traveling together, with local hotspots representing bus stops where these passengers get on and off. Based on this analogy, animation paths are generated like bus routes, with the object layout generated similarly to seat allocation according to their destinations. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, RouteFlow better facilitates identifying the global trend and locating local hotspots while performing comparably in tracking objects' movements.</p></details> | Accepted to CHI 2025 |
| **[Swept Volume-Aware Trajectory Planning and MPC Tracking for Multi-Axle Swerve-Drive AMRs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16875v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-axle autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) are set to revolutionize the future of robotics in logistics. As the backbone of next-generation solutions, these robots face a critical challenge: managing and minimizing the swept volume during turns while maintaining precise control. Traditional systems designed for standard vehicles often struggle with the complex dynamics of multi-axle configurations, leading to inefficiency and increased safety risk in confined spaces. Our innovative framework overcomes these limitations by combining swept volume minimization with Signed Distance Field (SDF) path planning and model predictive control (MPC) for independent wheel steering. This approach not only plans paths with an awareness of the swept volume but actively minimizes it in real-time, allowing each axle to follow a precise trajectory while significantly reducing the space the vehicle occupies. By predicting future states and adjusting the turning radius of each wheel, our method enhances both maneuverability and safety, even in the most constrained environments. Unlike previous works, our solution goes beyond basic path calculation and tracking, offering real-time path optimization with minimal swept volume and efficient individual axle control. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive approach to tackle these challenges, delivering life-saving improvements in control, efficiency, and safety for multi-axle AMRs. Furthermore, we will open-source our work to foster collaboration and enable others to advance safer, more efficient autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper Accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[HGTUL: A Hypergraph-based Model For Trajectory User Linking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07549v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory User Linking (TUL), which links anonymous trajectories with users who generate them, plays a crucial role in modeling human mobility. Despite significant advancements in this field, existing studies primarily neglect the high-order inter-trajectory relationships, which represent complex associations among multiple trajectories, manifested through multi-location co-occurrence patterns emerging when trajectories intersect at various Points of Interest (POIs). Furthermore, they also overlook the variable influence of POIs on different trajectories, as well as the user class imbalance problem caused by disparities in user activity levels and check-in frequencies. To address these limitations, we propose a novel HyperGraph-based multi-perspective Trajectory User Linking model (HGTUL). Our model learns trajectory representations from both relational and spatio-temporal perspectives: (1) it captures high-order associations among trajectories by constructing a trajectory hypergraph and leverages a hypergraph attention network to learn the variable impact of POIs on trajectories; (2) it models the spatio-temporal characteristics of trajectories by incorporating their temporal and spatial information into a sequential encoder. Moreover, we design a data balancing method to effectively address the user class imbalance problem and experimentally validate its significance in TUL. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HGTUL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving improvements of 2.57%~20.09% and 5.68%~26.00% in ACC@1 and Macro-F1 metrics, respectively.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[PLMTrajRec: A Scalable and Generalizable Trajectory Recovery Method with Pre-trained Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14281v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal trajectory data is crucial for various applications. However, issues such as device malfunctions and network instability often cause sparse trajectories, leading to lost detailed movement information. Recovering the missing points in sparse trajectories to restore the detailed information is thus essential. Despite recent progress, several challenges remain. First, the lack of large-scale dense trajectory data makes it difficult to train a trajectory recovery model from scratch. Second, the varying spatiotemporal correlations in sparse trajectories make it hard to generalize recovery across different sampling intervals. Third, the lack of location information complicates the extraction of road conditions for missing points. To address these challenges, we propose a novel trajectory recovery model called PLMTrajRec. It leverages the scalability of a pre-trained language model (PLM) and can be fine-tuned with only a limited set of dense trajectories. To handle different sampling intervals in sparse trajectories, we first convert each trajectory's sampling interval and movement features into natural language representations, allowing the PLM to recognize its interval. We then introduce a trajectory encoder to unify trajectories of varying intervals into a single interval and capture their spatiotemporal relationships. To obtain road conditions for missing points, we propose an area flow-guided implicit trajectory prompt, which models road conditions by collecting traffic flows in each region. We also introduce a road condition passing mechanism that uses observed points' road conditions to infer those of the missing points. Experiments on two public trajectory datasets with three sampling intervals each demonstrate the effectiveness, scalability, and generalization ability of PLMTrajRec.</p></details> |  |
| **[Holistic Semantic Representation for Navigational Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02737v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory generation has garnered significant attention from researchers in the field of spatio-temporal analysis, as it can generate substantial synthesized human mobility trajectories that enhance user privacy and alleviate data scarcity. However, existing trajectory generation methods often focus on improving trajectory generation quality from a singular perspective, lacking a comprehensive semantic understanding across various scales. Consequently, we are inspired to develop a HOlistic SEmantic Representation (HOSER) framework for navigational trajectory generation. Given an origin-and-destination (OD) pair and the starting time point of a latent trajectory, we first propose a Road Network Encoder to expand the receptive field of road- and zone-level semantics. Second, we design a Multi-Granularity Trajectory Encoder to integrate the spatio-temporal semantics of the generated trajectory at both the point and trajectory levels. Finally, we employ a Destination-Oriented Navigator to seamlessly integrate destination-oriented guidance. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HOSER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin. Moreover, the model's performance in few-shot learning and zero-shot learning scenarios further verifies the effectiveness of our holistic semantic representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Online Aggregation of Trajectory Predictors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07178v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction, the task of forecasting future agent behavior from past data, is central to safe and efficient autonomous driving. A diverse set of methods (e.g., rule-based or learned with different architectures and datasets) have been proposed, yet it is often the case that the performance of these methods is sensitive to the deployment environment (e.g., how well the design rules model the environment, or how accurately the test data match the training data). Building upon the principled theory of online convex optimization but also going beyond convexity and stationarity, we present a lightweight and model-agnostic method to aggregate different trajectory predictors online. We propose treating each individual trajectory predictor as an "expert" and maintaining a probability vector to mix the outputs of different experts. Then, the key technical approach lies in leveraging online data -- the true agent behavior to be revealed at the next timestep -- to form a convex-or-nonconvex, stationary-or-dynamic loss function whose gradient steers the probability vector towards choosing the best mixture of experts. We instantiate this method to aggregate trajectory predictors trained on different cities in the NUSCENES dataset and show that it performs just as well, if not better than, any singular model, even when deployed on the out-of-distribution LYFT dataset.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Reward-Based Collision-Free Algorithm for Trajectory Planning of Autonomous Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06149v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a new mission planning algorithm for autonomous robots that enables the reward-based selection of an optimal waypoint sequence from a predefined set. The algorithm computes a feasible trajectory and corresponding control inputs for a robot to navigate between waypoints while avoiding obstacles, maximizing the total reward, and adhering to constraints on state, input and its derivatives, mission time window, and maximum distance. This also solves a generalized prize-collecting traveling salesman problem. The proposed algorithm employs a new genetic algorithm that evolves solution candidates toward the optimal solution based on a fitness function and crossover. During fitness evaluation, a penalty method enforces constraints, and the differential flatness property with clothoid curves efficiently penalizes infeasible trajectories. The Euler spiral method showed promising results for trajectory parameterization compared to minimum snap and jerk polynomials. Due to the discrete exploration space, crossover is performed using a dynamic time-warping-based method and extended convex combination with projection. A mutation step enhances exploration. Results demonstrate the algorithm's ability to find the optimal waypoint sequence, fulfill constraints, avoid infeasible waypoints, and prioritize high-reward ones. Simulations and experiments with a ground vehicle, quadrotor, and quadruped are presented, complemented by benchmarking and a time-complexity analysis.</p></details> |  |

While many promising methods have been developed using online corpora and captioned photographs, their application to scientific domains, where data encodes highly specialized knowledge, remains in its early stages. We present a self-supervised masked modeling framework for 3D particle trajectory analysis in Time Projection Chambers (TPCs). These detectors produce globally sparse (<1% occupancy) but locally dense point clouds, capturing meter-scale particle trajectories at millimeter resolution. Starting with PointMAE, this work proposes volumetric tokenization to group sparse ionization points into resolution-agnostic patches, as well as an auxiliary energy infilling task to improve trajectory semantics. This approach -- which we call Point-based Liquid Argon Masked Autoencoder (PoLAr-MAE) -- achieves 99.4% track and 97.7% shower classification F-scores, matching that of supervised baselines without any labeled data. While the model learns rich particle trajectory representations, it struggles with sub-token phenomena like overlapping or short-lived particle trajectories. To support further research, we release PILArNet-M -- the largest open LArTPC dataset (1M+ events, 5.2B labeled points) -- to advance SSL in high energy physics (HEP).

Traditional approaches usually focus on static road network and trajectory representation learning, and overlook the dynamic nature of traffic states and trajectories, which is crucial for downstream tasks. To address this gap, we propose TRACK, a novel framework to bridge traffic state and trajectory data for dynamic road network and trajectory representation learning. TRACK leverages graph attention networks (GAT) to encode static and spatial road segment features, and introduces a transformer-based model for trajectory representation learning. By incorporating transition probabilities from trajectory data into GAT attention weights, TRACK captures dynamic spatial features of road segments. Meanwhile, TRACK designs a traffic transformer encoder to capture the spatial-temporal dynamics of road segments from traffic state data. To further enhance dynamic representations, TRACK proposes a co-attentional transformer encoder and a trajectory-traffic state matching task. Extensive experiments on real-life urban traffic datasets demonstrate the superiority of TRACK over state-of-the-art baselines. Case studies confirm TRACK's ability to capture spatial-temporal dynamics effectively.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

In particular, real trajectories in the wildlife domain are scarce as a result of ethical and environmental constraints of the collection process. In this paper, we consider the problem of generating long-horizon trajectories, akin to wildlife migration, based on a small set of real samples. We propose a hierarchical approach to learn the global movement characteristics of the real dataset and recursively refine localized regions. Our solution, WildGraph, discretizes the geographic path into a prototype network of H3 (https://www.uber.com/blog/h3/) regions and leverages a recurrent variational auto-encoder to probabilistically generate paths over the regions, based on occupancy. WildGraph successfully generates realistic months-long trajectories using a sample size as small as 60. Experiments performed on two wildlife migration datasets demonstrate that our proposed method improves the generalization of the generated trajectories in comparison to existing work while achieving superior or comparable performance in several benchmark metrics.

Previous methods on controllable video generation primarily leverage 2D control signals to manipulate object motions and have achieved remarkable synthesis results. However, 2D control signals are inherently limited in expressing the 3D nature of object motions. To overcome this problem, we introduce 3DTrajMaster, a robust controller that regulates multi-entity dynamics in 3D space, given user-desired 6DoF pose (location and rotation) sequences of entities. At the core of our approach is a plug-and-play 3D-motion grounded object injector that fuses multiple input entities with their respective 3D trajectories through a gated self-attention mechanism. In addition, we exploit an injector architecture to preserve the video diffusion prior, which is crucial for generalization ability. To mitigate video quality degradation, we introduce a domain adaptor during training and employ an annealed sampling strategy during inference. To address the lack of suitable training data, we construct a 360-Motion Dataset, which first correlates collected 3D human and animal assets with GPT-generated trajectory and then captures their motion with 12 evenly-surround cameras on diverse 3D UE platforms. Extensive experiments show that 3DTrajMaster sets a new state-of-the-art in both accuracy and generalization for controlling multi-entity 3D motions.

Here, such characterization for the optimal learning trajectories is associated with the solution of an optimal control problem for a weakly-controlled gradient system with small parameters, whose time-evolution is guided by a model training dataset and its perturbed version, while the optimization problem consists of a cost functional that summarizes how to gauge the quality/performance of the estimated model parameters at a certain fixed final time w.r.t. a model validating dataset.

Despite growing interest, recent approaches often struggle with two major challenges: multi-dancer collisions and single-dancer foot sliding. To address these challenges, we propose a Trajectory-Controllable Diffusion (TCDiff) framework, which leverages non-overlapping trajectories to ensure coherent and aesthetically pleasing dance movements. To mitigate collisions, we introduce a Dance-Trajectory Navigator that generates collision-free trajectories for multiple dancers, utilizing a distance-consistency loss to maintain optimal spacing. Furthermore, to reduce foot sliding, we present a footwork adaptor that adjusts trajectory displacement between frames, supported by a relative forward-kinematic loss to further reinforce the correlation between movements and trajectories. Experiments demonstrate our method's superiority.</p></details> |  |

However, this information has not been fully exploited during the inference phase, where the agent needs to generate an optimal policy instead of just reconstructing masked components from unmasked ones. Given that a pretrained trajectory model can act as both a Policy Model and a World Model with appropriate mask patterns, we propose using Model Predictive Control (MPC) at test time to leverage the model's own predictive capability to guide its action selection. Empirical results on D4RL and RoboMimic show that our inference-phase MPC significantly improves the decision-making performance of a pretrained trajectory model without any additional parameter training. Furthermore, our framework can be adapted to Offline to Online (O2O) RL and Goal Reaching RL, resulting in more substantial performance gains when an additional online interaction budget is provided, and better generalization capabilities when different task targets are specified.

In order to ensure this system operates as intended, accurate tracking of the spatiotemporal trajectory is of crucial significance. Moreover, minimizing the tracking error is a necessary step in this process. To this end, a novel lead-lag judgment mechanism is proposed. This mechanism precisely quantifies the longitudinal positional deviation between the vehicle and the target trajectory over time, then the deviation is corrected with a real - time acceleration compensation strategy, as a result, the accuracy and reliability of trajectory tracking are significantly enhanced. Real - vehicle experiments were conducted in a dedicated test field to validate the feasibility of this innovative approach empirically. Subsequently, the obtained tracking data was subsequent processed using the lead-lag judgment mechanism. In this step, we carefully analyzed the spatiotemporal error patterns between the vehicle and the target trajectory under different alignments and speeds. Finally, using real highway speed and alignment data, we conducted comprehensive spatiotemporal trajectory tracking simulations. Through experiments and simulations, tracking errors maintained in an acceptable range and reasonable spatiotemporal distance is given during the preemptive merging process on highway ramps. Overall, this study offers valuable insights for highway ramp emerging safety. Future work can expand on these findings.</p></details> |  |

Model Predictive Contouring Control (MPCC) is a highly effective local trajectory planning method for autonomous racing. However, the traditional MPCC method struggles with racetracks that have significant curvature changes, limiting the performance of the vehicle during autonomous racing. To address this issue, we propose a curvature-integrated MPCC (CiMPCC) local trajectory planning method for autonomous racing. This method optimizes the velocity of the local trajectory based on the curvature of the racetrack centerline. The specific implementation involves mapping the curvature of the racetrack centerline to a reference velocity profile, which is then incorporated into the cost function for optimizing the velocity of the local trajectory. This reference velocity profile is created by normalizing and mapping the curvature of the racetrack centerline, thereby ensuring efficient and performance-oriented local trajectory planning in racetracks with significant curvature. The proposed CiMPCC method has been experimented on a self-built 1:10 scale F1TENTH racing vehicle deployed with ROS platform. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves outstanding results on a challenging racetrack with sharp curvature, improving the overall lap time by 11.4%-12.5% compared to other autonomous racing trajectory planning methods.

However, applying these models requires inferring their specifications from observed behaviors -- a challenging task known as the inverse game problem. Existing inverse game approaches often struggle to account for behavioral uncertainty and measurement noise, and leverage both offline and online data. To address these limitations, we propose an inverse game method that integrates a generative trajectory model into a differentiable mixed-strategy game framework. By representing the mixed strategy with a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), our method can infer high-dimensional, multi-modal behavior distributions from noisy measurements while adapting in real-time to new observations. We extensively evaluate our method in a simulated navigation benchmark, where the observations are generated by an unknown game model. Despite the model mismatch, our method can infer Nash-optimal actions comparable to those of the ground-truth model and the oracle inverse game baseline, even in the presence of uncertain agent objectives and noisy measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025. 8 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

Pretraining on vast web-scale data has laid the foundation for these models, yet the research community is now increasingly shifting focus toward post-training techniques to achieve further breakthroughs. While pretraining provides a broad linguistic foundation, post-training methods enable LLMs to refine their knowledge, improve reasoning, enhance factual accuracy, and align more effectively with user intents and ethical considerations. Fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and test-time scaling have emerged as critical strategies for optimizing LLMs performance, ensuring robustness, and improving adaptability across various real-world tasks. This survey provides a systematic exploration of post-training methodologies, analyzing their role in refining LLMs beyond pretraining, addressing key challenges such as catastrophic forgetting, reward hacking, and inference-time trade-offs. We highlight emerging directions in model alignment, scalable adaptation, and inference-time reasoning, and outline future research directions. We also provide a public repository to continually track developments in this fast-evolving field: https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/Awesome-LLM-Post-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables, 375 references</p></details> |

However, the potential flaws of periodicity modeling in Transformer affect the learning efficiency and establishment of underlying principles from data for large language models (LLMs) built upon it. In this paper, we demonstrate that integrating effective periodicity modeling can improve the learning efficiency and performance of LLMs. We introduce FANformer, which integrates Fourier Analysis Network (FAN) into attention mechanism to achieve efficient periodicity modeling, by modifying the feature projection process of attention mechanism. Extensive experimental results on language modeling show that FANformer consistently outperforms Transformer when scaling up model size and training tokens, underscoring its superior learning efficiency. To further validate the effectiveness of FANformer, we pretrain a FANformer-1B on 1 trillion tokens. FANformer-1B exhibits marked improvements on downstream tasks compared to open-source LLMs with similar model parameters or training tokens. The results position FANformer as an effective and promising architecture for advancing LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, their application in specialized tasks such as Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) for low-resource languages like Arabic remains underexplored. In this work, we address this gap by developing an Arabic LJP dataset, collected and preprocessed from Saudi commercial court judgments. We benchmark state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, including LLaMA-3.2-3B and LLaMA-3.1-8B, under varying configurations such as zero-shot, one-shot, and fine-tuning using LoRA. Additionally, we employed a comprehensive evaluation framework that integrates both quantitative metrics (such as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERT) and qualitative assessments (including Coherence, Legal Language, Clarity, etc.) using an LLM. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned smaller models achieve comparable performance to larger models in task-specific contexts while offering significant resource efficiency. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of fine-tuning the model on a diverse set of instructions, offering valuable insights into the development of a more human-centric and adaptable LLM. We have made the dataset, code, and models publicly available to provide a solid foundation for future research in Arabic legal NLP.</p></details> |  |

For large contexts, Key-Value caches can take up tens of gigabytes of device memory, as they store vector representations for each token and layer. Recent work has shown that the cached vectors can be compressed through quantization, pruning or merging, but these techniques often compromise quality towards higher compression rates. In this work, we aim to improve Key & Value compression by exploiting two observations: 1) the inherent dependencies between keys and values across different layers, and 2) high-compression mechanisms for internal network states. We propose AQUA-KV, an adaptive quantization for Key-Value caches that relies on compact adapters to exploit existing dependencies between Keys and Values, and aims to "optimally" compress the information that cannot be predicted. AQUA-KV significantly improves compression rates, while maintaining high accuracy on state-of-the-art LLM families. On Llama 3.2 LLMs, we achieve near-lossless inference at 2-2.5 bits per value with under $1\%$ relative error in perplexity and LongBench scores. AQUA-KV is one-shot, simple, and efficient: it can be calibrated on a single GPU within 1-6 hours, even for 70B models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |
| **[Large Sample Inference with Dynamic Information Borrowing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21282v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large sample behavior of dynamic information borrowing (DIB) estimators is investigated. Asymptotic properties of several DIB approaches (adaptive risk minimization, adaptive LASSO, Bayesian procedures with empirical power prior, fully Bayesian procedures, and a Bayes-frequentist compromise) are explored against shrinking to zero alternatives. As shown theoretically and with simulations, local asymptotic distributions of DIB estimators are often non-normal. A simple Gaussian setting with external information borrowing illustrates that none of the considered DIB methods outperforms others in terms of mean squared error (MSE): at different conflict values, the MSEs of DIBs are changing between the MSEs of the maximum likelihood estimators based on the current and pooled data. To uniquely determine an optimality criterion for DIB, a prior distribution on the conflict needs be either implicitly or explicitly determined using data independent considerations. Data independent assumptions on the conflict are also needed for DIB-based hypothesis testing. New families of DIB estimators parameterized by a sensitivity-to-conflict parameter S are suggested and their use is illustrated in an infant mortality example. The choice of S is determined in a data-independent manner by a cost-benefit compromise associated with the use of external data.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

Among others, the scale of the random initialization, the learning rate, and early stopping all have crucial impact on the quality of the model learnt by stochastic gradient descent or related algorithms. In order to understand these phenomena, we study the training dynamics of large two-layer neural networks. We use a well-established technique from non-equilibrium statistical physics (dynamical mean field theory) to obtain an asymptotic high-dimensional characterization of this dynamics. This characterization applies to a Gaussian approximation of the hidden neurons non-linearity, and empirically captures well the behavior of actual neural network models. Our analysis uncovers several interesting new phenomena in the training dynamics: $(i)$ The emergence of a slow time scale associated with the growth in Gaussian/Rademacher complexity; $(ii)$ As a consequence, algorithmic inductive bias towards small complexity, but only if the initialization has small enough complexity; $(iii)$ A separation of time scales between feature learning and overfitting; $(iv)$ A non-monotone behavior of the test error and, correspondingly, a `feature unlearning' phase at large times.</p></details> | <details><summary>89 pa...</summary><p>89 pages; 62 pdf figures</p></details> |
| **[Dual Thinking and Logical Processing -- Are Multi-modal Large Language Models Closing the Gap with Human Vision ?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06967v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dual thinking framework considers fast, intuitive, and slower logical processing. The perception of dual thinking in vision requires images where inferences from intuitive and logical processing differ, and the latter is under-explored in current studies. We introduce a novel adversarial dataset to provide evidence for the dual thinking framework in human vision, which also facilitates the study of the qualitative behavior of deep learning models. Our psychophysical studies show the presence of multiple inferences in rapid succession, and analysis of errors shows that the early stopping of visual processing can result in missing relevant information. MLLMs (Multi-modal Large Language Models) and VLMs (Vision Language Models) have made significant progress in correcting errors in intuitive processing in human vision and showed enhanced performance on images requiring logical processing. However, their improvements in logical processing have not kept pace with their advancements in intuitive processing. In contrast, segmentation models exhibit errors similar to those seen in intuitive human processing and lack understanding of sub-structures, as indicated by errors related to sub-components in identified instances. As AI (Artificial Intelligence)-based systems find increasing applications in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving, the integration of logical processing capabilities becomes essential. This not only enhances performance but also addresses the limitations of scaling-based approaches while ensuring robustness and reliability in real-world environments.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, existing research focuses on simple paraphrasing-based consistency assessment of LLMs, and ignores complex queries that necessitate an even better understanding of logical reasoning by an LLM. Our work therefore addresses the logical inconsistency of LLMs under complex logical queries with primitive logical operators, e.g., negation, conjunction, and disjunction. As a test bed, we consider retrieval-augmented LLMs on a fact-checking task involving propositional logic queries from knowledge graphs (KGs). Our contributions are threefold. Benchmark: We introduce three logical fact-checking datasets over KGs for community development towards logically consistent LLMs. Assessment: We propose consistency measures of LLMs on propositional logic queries and demonstrate that existing LLMs lack logical consistency, especially on complex queries. Improvement: We employ supervised fine-tuning to improve the logical consistency of LLMs on the complex fact-checking task with KG contexts. We have made our source code and benchmarks available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Unlike traditional optimizers that directly integrate momentum into updates, Grams separates the update direction, derived from current gradients, from momentum, which is used solely for adaptive magnitude scaling. This approach enables Grams to achieve improved loss descent compared to state-of-the-art cautious and momentum-based optimizers. We theoretically demonstrate that Grams descents faster than other state-of-the-art optimizers and establish a global convergence guarantee for Grams. We also validate its effectiveness through extensive empirical evaluations. The results demonstrate Grams' superior performance, including faster convergence and better generalization, compared to widely-used optimizers such as Adam, Lion, and their cautious variants. Our results highlight Grams' potential as a transformative approach for efficiently training large language models.

| **[Dynamically Local-Enhancement Planner for Large-Scale Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21134v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current autonomous vehicles operate primarily within limited regions, but there is increasing demand for broader applications. However, as models scale, their limited capacity becomes a significant challenge for adapting to novel scenarios. It is increasingly difficult to improve models for new situations using a single monolithic model. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of dynamically enhancing a basic driving planner with local driving data, without permanently modifying the planner itself. This approach, termed the Dynamically Local-Enhancement (DLE) Planner, aims to improve the scalability of autonomous driving systems without significantly expanding the planner's size. Our approach introduces a position-varying Markov Decision Process formulation coupled with a graph neural network that extracts region-specific driving features from local observation data. The learned features describe the local behavior of the surrounding objects, which is then leveraged to enhance a basic reinforcement learning-based policy. We evaluated our approach in multiple scenarios and compared it with a one-for-all driving model. The results show that our method outperforms the baseline policy in both safety (collision rate) and average reward, while maintaining a lighter scale. This approach has the potential to benefit large-scale autonomous vehicles without the need for largely expanding on-device driving models.</p></details> |  |

However, the current community of LLMs overly focuses on benchmarks for analyzing specific foundational skills (e.g. mathematics and code generation), neglecting an all-round evaluation of the computer science field. To bridge this gap, we introduce CS-Bench, the first multilingual (English, Chinese, French, German) benchmark dedicated to evaluating the performance of LLMs in computer science. CS-Bench comprises approximately 10K meticulously curated test samples, covering 26 subfields across 4 key areas of computer science, encompassing various task forms and divisions of knowledge and reasoning. Utilizing CS-Bench, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of over 30 mainstream LLMs, revealing the relationship between CS performance and model scales. We also quantitatively analyze the reasons for failures in existing LLMs and highlight directions for improvements, including knowledge supplementation and CS-specific reasoning. Further cross-capability experiments show a high correlation between LLMs' capabilities in computer science and their abilities in mathematics and coding. Moreover, expert LLMs specialized in mathematics and coding also demonstrate strong performances in several CS subfields. Looking ahead, we envision CS-Bench serving as a cornerstone for LLM applications in the CS field and paving new avenues in assessing LLMs' diverse reasoning capabilities. The CS-Bench data and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/csbench/csbench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Regrettably, this explosion has also spawned a significant increase in the online abuse of memes. Evaluating the negative impact of memes is notably challenging, owing to their often subtle and implicit meanings, which are not directly conveyed through the overt text and image. In light of this, large multimodal models (LMMs) have emerged as a focal point of interest due to their remarkable capabilities in handling diverse multimodal tasks. In response to this development, our paper aims to thoroughly examine the capacity of various LMMs (e.g., GPT-4o) to discern and respond to the nuanced aspects of social abuse manifested in memes. We introduce the comprehensive meme benchmark, GOAT-Bench, comprising over 6K varied memes encapsulating themes such as implicit hate speech, sexism, and cyberbullying, etc. Utilizing GOAT-Bench, we delve into the ability of LMMs to accurately assess hatefulness, misogyny, offensiveness, sarcasm, and harmful content. Our extensive experiments across a range of LMMs reveal that current models still exhibit a deficiency in safety awareness, showing insensitivity to various forms of implicit abuse. We posit that this shortfall represents a critical impediment to the realization of safe artificial intelligence. The GOAT-Bench and accompanying resources are publicly accessible at https://goatlmm.github.io/, contributing to ongoing research in this vital field.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first work to benchmark Large Multimodal Models in safety insight on social media</p></details> |

To address this, we propose AdEval (Alignment-based Dynamic Evaluation), a dynamic data evaluation method aimed at mitigating the impact of data contamination on evaluation reliability. AdEval extracts key knowledge points and main ideas to align dynamically generated questions with static data's core concepts. It also leverages online search to provide detailed explanations of related knowledge points, thereby creating high-quality evaluation samples with robust knowledge support. Furthermore, AdEval incorporates mechanisms to control the number and complexity of questions, enabling dynamic alignment and flexible adjustment. This ensures that the generated questions align with the complexity of static data while supporting varied complexity levels. Based on Bloom's taxonomy, AdEval conducts a multi-dimensional evaluation of LLMs across six cognitive levels: remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that AdEval effectively reduces the impact of data contamination on evaluation outcomes, enhancing both the fairness and reliability of the evaluation process.</p></details> | <details><summary>There...</summary><p>There are serious academic problems in this paper, such as data falsification and plagiarism in the method of the paper</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Large Language Models for ESG Activity Detection in Financial Texts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21112v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors into corporate decision-making is a fundamental aspect of sustainable finance. However, ensuring that business practices align with evolving regulatory frameworks remains a persistent challenge. AI-driven solutions for automatically assessing the alignment of sustainability reports and non-financial disclosures with specific ESG activities could greatly support this process. Yet, this task remains complex due to the limitations of general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) in domain-specific contexts and the scarcity of structured, high-quality datasets. In this paper, we investigate the ability of current-generation LLMs to identify text related to environmental activities. Furthermore, we demonstrate that their performance can be significantly enhanced through fine-tuning on a combination of original and synthetically generated data. To this end, we introduce ESG-Activities, a benchmark dataset containing 1,325 labelled text segments classified according to the EU ESG taxonomy. Our experimental results show that fine-tuning on ESG-Activities significantly enhances classification accuracy, with open models such as Llama 7B and Gemma 7B outperforming large proprietary solutions in specific configurations. These findings have important implications for financial analysts, policymakers, and AI researchers seeking to enhance ESG transparency and compliance through advanced natural language processing techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning diverse attacks on large language models for robust red-teaming and safety tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18540v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Red-teaming, or identifying prompts that elicit harmful responses, is a critical step in ensuring the safe and responsible deployment of large language models (LLMs). Developing effective protection against many modes of attack prompts requires discovering diverse attacks. Automated red-teaming typically uses reinforcement learning to fine-tune an attacker language model to generate prompts that elicit undesirable responses from a target LLM, as measured, for example, by an auxiliary toxicity classifier. We show that even with explicit regularization to favor novelty and diversity, existing approaches suffer from mode collapse or fail to generate effective attacks. As a flexible and probabilistically principled alternative, we propose to use GFlowNet fine-tuning, followed by a secondary smoothing phase, to train the attacker model to generate diverse and effective attack prompts. We find that the attacks generated by our method are effective against a wide range of target LLMs, both with and without safety tuning, and transfer well between target LLMs. Finally, we demonstrate that models safety-tuned using a dataset of red-teaming prompts generated by our method are robust to attacks from other RL-based red-teaming approaches.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[Large Language Model-Based Benchmarking Experiment Settings for Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21108v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When we manually design an evolutionary optimization algorithm, we implicitly or explicitly assume a set of target optimization problems. In the case of automated algorithm design, target optimization problems are usually explicitly shown. Recently, the use of large language models (LLMs) for the design of evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithms have been examined in some studies. In those studies, target multi-objective problems are not always explicitly shown. It is well known in the EMO community that the performance evaluation results of EMO algorithms depend on not only test problems but also many other factors such as performance indicators, reference point, termination condition, and population size. Thus, it is likely that the designed EMO algorithms by LLMs depends on those factors. In this paper, we try to examine the implicit assumption about the performance comparison of EMO algorithms in LLMs. For this purpose, we ask LLMs to design a benchmarking experiment of EMO algorithms. Our experiments show that LLMs often suggest classical benchmark settings: Performance examination of NSGA-II, MOEA/D and NSGA-III on ZDT, DTLZ and WFG by HV and IGD under the standard parameter specifications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Re-evaluating Theory of Mind evaluation in large language models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21098v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The question of whether large language models (LLMs) possess Theory of Mind (ToM) -- often defined as the ability to reason about others' mental states -- has sparked significant scientific and public interest. However, the evidence as to whether LLMs possess ToM is mixed, and the recent growth in evaluations has not resulted in a convergence. Here, we take inspiration from cognitive science to re-evaluate the state of ToM evaluation in LLMs. We argue that a major reason for the disagreement on whether LLMs have ToM is a lack of clarity on whether models should be expected to match human behaviors, or the computations underlying those behaviors. We also highlight ways in which current evaluations may be deviating from "pure" measurements of ToM abilities, which also contributes to the confusion. We conclude by discussing several directions for future research, including the relationship between ToM and pragmatic communication, which could advance our understanding of artificial systems as well as human cognition.</p></details> | under review |

However, the decentralized nature of FL exacerbates data quality challenges, as local clients lack global visibility to filter noisy or low-quality samples before training. To resolve this issue, we propose FedDQC, a novel federated instruction tuning framework with dynamic data quality control. Our approach introduces two key innovations. First, we propose instruction-response alignment (IRA), an efficient client-side metric for quality evaluation requiring only low-cost inference. We validate that higher-IRA data corresponds to more relevant and easier-to-learn question-answer pairs. Second, mirroring the human easy-to-hard knowledge acquisition process, we design a quality-aware hierarchical FL training framework, where the LLM is progressively fine-tuned from high- to low-IRA data in a collaborative manner. The framework also supports adaptive data quality assessment at each hierarchy, enabling dynamic adjustments throughout the training process. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method significantly improves LLM performance on mixed-quality data in FL.</p></details> |  |
| **[FC-Attack: Jailbreaking Large Vision-Language Models via Auto-Generated Flowcharts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21059v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have become powerful and widely adopted in some practical applications. However, recent research has revealed their vulnerability to multimodal jailbreak attacks, whereby the model can be induced to generate harmful content, leading to safety risks. Although most LVLMs have undergone safety alignment, recent research shows that the visual modality is still vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. In our work, we discover that by using flowcharts with partially harmful information, LVLMs can be induced to provide additional harmful details. Based on this, we propose a jailbreak attack method based on auto-generated flowcharts, FC-Attack. Specifically, FC-Attack first fine-tunes a pre-trained LLM to create a step-description generator based on benign datasets. The generator is then used to produce step descriptions corresponding to a harmful query, which are transformed into flowcharts in 3 different shapes (vertical, horizontal, and S-shaped) as visual prompts. These flowcharts are then combined with a benign textual prompt to execute a jailbreak attack on LVLMs. Our evaluations using the Advbench dataset show that FC-Attack achieves over 90% attack success rates on Gemini-1.5, Llaval-Next, Qwen2-VL, and InternVL-2.5 models, outperforming existing LVLM jailbreak methods. Additionally, we investigate factors affecting the attack performance, including the number of steps and the font styles in the flowcharts. Our evaluation shows that FC-Attack can improve the jailbreak performance from 4% to 28% in Claude-3.5 by changing the font style. To mitigate the attack, we explore several defenses and find that AdaShield can largely reduce the jailbreak performance but with the cost of utility drop.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

However, these individual LLMs show limitations in generalization and performance on complex tasks due to inherent training biases, model size constraints, and the quality or diversity of pre-training datasets. A promising direction is to efficiently harness the diverse capabilities of LLMs to overcome these individual limitations. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel LLM selection algorithm called SelectLLM, which efficiently directs input queries to the most suitable subset of LLMs from a large pool, ensuring that the selected models collectively provide accurate responses. SelectLLM employs a multi-label classifier and policy based on the classifier's predictions and confidence scores in selecting an optimal, query-aware, and lightweight subset of LLMs. Our findings indicate that the proposed model outperforms existing ensemble-based baselines and achieves competitive performance with similarly sized top-performing LLMs while maintaining efficiency. Specifically, it achieves a huge reduction in inference latency on two challenging reasoning benchmarks: 13% on GSM8K and 70% on MMLU, compared to the top-performing baseline. Also, we establish a theoretical upper bound by an Oracle with LLMs and perform an in-depth linguistic analysis to understand the performance gap between the Oracle and SelectLLM.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Although conversations can elicit trust between users and LLMs, scarce empirical research has examined trust formation in human-LLM contexts, beyond LLMs' trustworthiness or human trust in AI in general. Here, we introduce the Trust-In-LLMs Index (TILLMI) as a new framework to measure individuals' trust in LLMs, extending McAllister's cognitive and affective trust dimensions to LLM-human interactions. We developed TILLMI as a psychometric scale, prototyped with a novel protocol we called LLM-simulated validity. The LLM-based scale was then validated in a sample of 1,000 US respondents. Exploratory Factor Analysis identified a two-factor structure. Two items were then removed due to redundancy, yielding a final 6-item scale with a 2-factor structure. Confirmatory Factor Analysis on a separate subsample showed strong model fit ($CFI = .995$, $TLI = .991$, $RMSEA = .046$, $p_{X^2} > .05$). Convergent validity analysis revealed that trust in LLMs correlated positively with openness to experience, extraversion, and cognitive flexibility, but negatively with neuroticism. Based on these findings, we interpreted TILLMI's factors as "closeness with LLMs" (affective dimension) and "reliance on LLMs" (cognitive dimension). Younger males exhibited higher closeness with- and reliance on LLMs compared to older women. Individuals with no direct experience with LLMs exhibited lower levels of trust compared to LLMs' users. These findings offer a novel empirical foundation for measuring trust in AI-driven verbal communication, informing responsible design, and fostering balanced human-AI collaboration.</p></details> | 24 pages, 6 figures |

We posit that these limitations are rooted in the foundational autoregressive architecture of LLMs, which inherently lacks mechanisms for differentiating between desirable and undesirable results. Drawing inspiration from the dual-process theory of human cognition, we introduce LLM2, a novel framework that combines an LLM (System 1) with a process-based verifier (System 2). Within LLM2, the LLM is responsible for generating plausible candidates, while the verifier provides timely process-based feedback to distinguish desirable and undesirable outputs. The verifier is trained with a pairwise comparison loss on synthetic process-supervision data generated through our token quality exploration strategy. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks substantiate the efficacy of LLM2, exemplified by an accuracy enhancement from 50.3 to 57.8 (+7.5) for Llama3-1B on GSM8K. Furthermore, when combined with self-consistency, LLM2 achieves additional improvements, boosting major@20 accuracy from 56.2 to 70.2 (+14.0).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

However, the inherent openness of sequential recommender systems renders them vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where fraudulent users are injected into the training data to manipulate learned patterns. Traditional defense strategies predominantly depend on predefined assumptions or rules extracted from specific known attacks, limiting their generalizability to unknown attack types. To solve the above problems, considering the rich open-world knowledge encapsulated in Large Language Models (LLMs), our research initially focuses on the capabilities of LLMs in the detection of unknown fraudulent activities within recommender systems, a strategy we denote as LLM4Dec. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the substantial capability of LLMs in identifying unknown fraudsters, leveraging their expansive, open-world knowledge. Building upon this, we propose the integration of LLMs into defense strategies to extend their effectiveness beyond the confines of known attacks. We propose LoRec, an advanced framework that employs LLM-Enhanced Calibration to strengthen the robustness of sequential recommender systems against poisoning attacks. LoRec integrates an LLM-enhanced CalibraTor (LCT) that refines the training process of sequential recommender systems with knowledge derived from LLMs, applying a user-wise reweighting to diminish the impact of fraudsters injected by attacks. By incorporating LLMs' open-world knowledge, the LCT effectively converts the limited, specific priors or rules into a more general pattern of fraudsters, offering improved defenses against poisoning attacks. Our comprehensive experiments validate that LoRec, as a general framework, significantly strengthens the robustness of sequential recommender systems.</p></details> |  |

However, training these LLMs typically involves substantial memory and computational costs during both forward and backward propagation. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) considerably reduces the training memory associated with parameters, it does not address the significant computational costs and activation memory. In this paper, we propose Dropping Backward Propagation (DropBP), a novel approach designed to reduce computational costs and activation memory while maintaining accuracy. DropBP randomly drops layers during backward propagation, which is essentially equivalent to training shallow submodules generated by undropped layers and residual connections. Additionally, DropBP calculates the sensitivity of each layer to assign an appropriate drop rate, thereby stabilizing the training process. DropBP is not only applicable to full fine-tuning but can also be orthogonally integrated with all types of PEFT by dropping layers during backward propagation. Specifically, DropBP can reduce training time by 44% with comparable accuracy to the baseline, accelerate convergence to the same perplexity by 1.5x, and enable training with a sequence length 6.2x larger on a single NVIDIA-A100 GPU. Furthermore, our DropBP enabled a throughput increase of 79% on a NVIDIA A100 GPU and 117% on an Intel Gaudi2 HPU. The code is available at https://github.com/WooSunghyeon/dropbp.</p></details> |  |

However, mapping large-sized quantum circuits in DQC is a challenging job; for example, it is difficult to find an ideal cutting and mapping solution when many qubits, complicated qubit operations, and diverse QPUs are involved. In this study, we propose LarQucut, a new quantum circuit cutting and mapping approach for large-sized circuits in DQC. LarQucut has several new designs. (1) LarQucut can have cutting solutions that use fewer cuts, and it does not cut a circuit into independent sub-circuits, therefore reducing the overall cutting and computing overheads. (2) LarQucut finds isomorphic sub-circuits and reuses their execution results. So, LarQucut can reduce the number of sub-circuits that need to be executed to reconstruct the large circuit's output, reducing the time spent on sampling the sub-circuits. (3) We design an adaptive quantum circuit mapping approach, which identifies qubit interaction patterns and accordingly enables the best-fit mapping policy in DQC. The experimental results show that, for large circuits with hundreds to thousands of qubits in DQC, LarQucut can provide a better cutting and mapping solution with lower overall overheads and achieves results closer to the ground truth.</p></details> |  |
| **[Merging Clinical Knowledge into Large Language Models for Medical Research and Applications: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20988v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical knowledge is the collection of information learned from studies on the causes, prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases. This type of knowledge can improve curing performances, and promote physical health. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), medical artificial intelligence (medical AI), which aims to apply academic medical AI systems to real-world medical scenarios, has entered a new age of development, resulting in excellent works such as DoctorGPT and Pangu-Drug from academic and industrial researches. However, the field lacks a comprehensive compendium and comparison of building medical AI systems from academia and industry. Therefore, this survey focuses on the building paradigms of medical AI systems including the use of clinical databases, datasets, training pipelines, integrating medical knowledge graphs, system applications, and evaluation systems. We hope that this survey can help relevant practical researchers understand the current performance of academic models in various fields of healthcare, as well as the potential problems and future directions for implementing these scientific achievements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Jailbreaking of Large Models by Freeze Training: Lower Layers Exhibit Greater Sensitivity to Harmful Content](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20952v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread application of Large Language Models across various domains, their security issues have increasingly garnered significant attention from both academic and industrial communities. This study conducts sampling and normalization of the parameters of the LLM to generate visual representations and heatmaps of parameter distributions, revealing notable discrepancies in parameter distributions among certain layers within the hidden layers. Further analysis involves calculating statistical metrics for each layer, followed by the computation of a Comprehensive Sensitivity Score based on these metrics, which identifies the lower layers as being particularly sensitive to the generation of harmful content. Based on this finding, we employ a Freeze training strategy, selectively performing Supervised Fine-Tuning only on the lower layers. Experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly reduces training duration and GPU memory consumption while maintaining a high jailbreak success rate and a high harm score, outperforming the results achieved by applying the LoRA method for SFT across all layers. Additionally, the method has been successfully extended to other open-source large models, validating its generality and effectiveness across different model architectures. Furthermore, we compare our method with ohter jailbreak method, demonstrating the superior performance of our approach. By innovatively proposing a method to statistically analyze and compare large model parameters layer by layer, this study provides new insights into the interpretability of large models. These discoveries emphasize the necessity of continuous research and the implementation of adaptive security measures in the rapidly evolving field of LLMs to prevent potential jailbreak attack risks, thereby promoting the development of more robust and secure LLMs.</p></details> |  |

While existing approaches leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) through extensive fine-tuning on materials databases, we show that pre-trained LLMs can inherently generate stable crystal structures without additional training. Our novel framework MatLLMSearch integrates pre-trained LLMs with evolutionary search algorithms, achieving a 78.38% metastable rate validated by machine learning interatomic potentials and 31.7% DFT-verified stability via quantum mechanical calculations, outperforming specialized models such as CrystalTextLLM. Beyond crystal structure generation, we further demonstrate that our framework can be readily adapted to diverse materials design tasks, including crystal structure prediction and multi-objective optimization of properties such as deformation energy and bulk modulus, all without fine-tuning. These results establish pre-trained LLMs as versatile and effective tools for materials discovery, opening up new venues for crystal structure generation with reduced computational overhead and broader accessibility.</p></details> | Preprint, 18 pages |

In this paper, we propose a projection estimator for the Tucker-decomposition based TFM, and provide its least-square interpretation which parallels to the least-square interpretation of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for the vector factor model. The projection technique simultaneously reduces the dimensionality of the signal component and the magnitudes of the idiosyncratic component tensor, thus leading to an increase of the signal-to-noise ratio. We derive a convergence rate of the projection estimator of the loadings and the common factor tensor which are faster than that of the naive PCA-based estimator. Our results are obtained under mild conditions which allow the idiosyncratic components to be weakly cross- and auto- correlated. We also provide a novel iterative procedure based on the eigenvalue-ratio principle to determine the factor numbers. Extensive numerical studies are conducted to investigate the empirical performance of the proposed projection estimators relative to the state-of-the-art ones.</p></details> |  |

LLMs have also been used to label data, but recent work has shown that models perform poorly when prompted with sociodemographic attributes, suggesting limited inherent sociodemographic knowledge. Here, we ask whether LLMs can be trained to be accurate sociodemographic models of annotator variation. Using a curated dataset of five tasks with standardized sociodemographics, we show that models do improve in sociodemographic prompting when trained but that this performance gain is largely due to models learning annotator-specific behaviour rather than sociodemographic patterns. Across all tasks, our results suggest that models learn little meaningful connection between sociodemographics and annotation, raising doubts about the current use of LLMs for simulating sociodemographic variation and behaviour.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revie...</summary><p>Reviewed ARR December 2024</p></details> |

However, existing benchmarks for coding evaluation are gradually inadequate to assess the capability of advanced LLMs in code reasoning. To bridge the gap for high-level code reasoning assessment, we propose ProBench to benchmark LLMs in competitive programming, drawing inspiration from the International Collegiate Programming Contest. ProBench collects a comprehensive set of competitive programming problems from Codeforces, Luogu, and Nowcoder platforms during the period from July to December 2024, obtaining real test results through online submissions to ensure the fairness and accuracy of the evaluation. We establish a unified problem attribute system, including difficulty grading and algorithm tagging. With carefully collected and annotated data in ProBench, we systematically assess 9 latest LLMs in competitive programming across multiple dimensions, including thought chain analysis, error type diagnosis, and reasoning depth evaluation. Experimental results show that QwQ-32B-Preview achieves the best score of 20.93 followed by DeepSeek-V3 with a score of 16.38, suggesting that models trained with specialized reasoning tasks significantly outperform general-purpose models (even larger than reasoning-oriented models) in programming. Further analysis also reveals key areas for programming capability enhancement, e.g., algorithm adaptability and reasoning sufficiency, providing important insights for the future development of reasoning models.</p></details> |  |

To fill this gap, this paper systematically investigates LLM intelligence through the lens of ``human simulation'', addressing three core questions: (1) How do personality traits affect problem-solving in closed tasks? (2) How do traits shape creativity in open tasks? (3) How does single-agent performance influence multi-agent collaboration? By assigning Big Five personality traits to LLM agents and evaluating their performance in single- and multi-agent settings, we reveal that specific traits significantly influence reasoning accuracy (closed tasks) and creative output (open tasks). Furthermore, multi-agent systems exhibit collective intelligence distinct from individual capabilities, driven by distinguishing combinations of personalities. We demonstrate that LLMs inherently simulate human behavior through next-token prediction, mirroring human language, decision-making, and collaborative dynamics.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the neural scaling law--increasing neurons enhances performance, this study explores whether the continuous addition of collaborative agents can yield similar benefits. Technically, we utilize directed acyclic graphs to organize agents into a multi-agent collaboration network (MacNet), upon which their interactive reasoning is topologically orchestrated for autonomous task solving. Extensive evaluations reveal that it effectively supports collaboration among over a thousand agents, with irregular topologies outperforming regular ones. We also identify a collaborative scaling law--the overall performance follows a logistic growth pattern as agents scale, with collaborative emergence occurring earlier than traditional neural emergence. We speculate this may be because scaling agents catalyzes their multidimensional considerations during interactive reflection and refinement, thereby producing more comprehensive artifacts.

However, we posit that typical reasoning traces contain many redundant tokens, incurring extraneous inference costs. Upon examination of the output distribution of current LLMs, we find evidence on their latent ability to reason more concisely, relative to their default behavior. To elicit this capability, we propose simple fine-tuning methods which leverage self-generated concise reasoning paths obtained by best-of-N sampling and few-shot conditioning, in task-specific settings. Our combined method achieves a 30% reduction in output tokens on average, across five model families on GSM8K and MATH, while maintaining average accuracy. By exploiting the fundamental stochasticity and in-context learning capabilities of LLMs, our self-training approach robustly elicits concise reasoning on a wide range of models, including those with extensive post-training.

We prove that language models are actually non-ergodic systems while providing a mathematical framework based on Stuart Kauffman's theory of the adjacent possible (TAP) to explain capability emergence. Our resource-constrained TAP equation demonstrates how architectural, training, and contextual constraints interact to shape model capabilities through phase transitions in semantic space. We prove through experiments with three different language models that capacities emerge through discrete transitions guided by constraint interactions and path-dependent exploration. This framework provides a theoretical basis for understanding emergence in language models and guides the development of architectures that can guide capability emergence.</p></details> |  |
| **[PediaBench: A Comprehensive Chinese Pediatric Dataset for Benchmarking Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06287v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the medical domain has stressed a compelling need for standard datasets to evaluate their question-answering (QA) performance. Although there have been several benchmark datasets for medical QA, they either cover common knowledge across different departments or are specific to another department rather than pediatrics. Moreover, some of them are limited to objective questions and do not measure the generation capacity of LLMs. Therefore, they cannot comprehensively assess the QA ability of LLMs in pediatrics. To fill this gap, we construct PediaBench, the first Chinese pediatric dataset for LLM evaluation. Specifically, it contains 4,117 objective questions and 1,632 subjective questions spanning 12 pediatric disease groups. It adopts an integrated scoring criterion based on different difficulty levels to thoroughly assess the proficiency of an LLM in instruction following, knowledge understanding, clinical case analysis, etc. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of PediaBench with extensive experiments on 20 open-source and commercial LLMs. Through an in-depth analysis of experimental results, we offer insights into the ability of LLMs to answer pediatric questions in the Chinese context, highlighting their limitations for further improvements. Our code and data are published at https://github.com/ACMISLab/PediaBench.</p></details> | 21 pages, 12 figures |

However, their performance on videos involving human actions is still limited by the lack of high-quality data. To address this, we introduce a two-stage data annotation pipeline. First, we design strategies to accumulate videos featuring clear human actions from the Internet. Second, videos are annotated in a standardized caption format that uses human attributes to distinguish individuals and chronologically details their actions and interactions. Through this pipeline, we curate two datasets, namely HAICTrain and HAICBench. \textbf{HAICTrain} comprises 126K video-caption pairs generated by Gemini-Pro and verified for training purposes. Meanwhile, \textbf{HAICBench} includes 500 manually annotated video-caption pairs and 1,400 QA pairs, for a comprehensive evaluation of human action understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that training with HAICTrain not only significantly enhances human understanding abilities across 4 benchmarks, but can also improve text-to-video generation results. Both the HAICTrain and HAICBench are released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/KuaishouHAIC/HAIC.</p></details> |  |

Although there is increasing interest in automating the design of routing algorithms, existing research has explored only a limited array of VRP variants and fails to adequately address the complex and prevalent constraints encountered in real-world situations. To fill this gap, this paper introduces RoutBench, a benchmark of 1,000 VRP variants derived from 24 attributes, for evaluating the effectiveness of automatic routing solvers in addressing complex constraints. Along with RoutBench, we present the Automatic Routing Solver (ARS), which employs Large Language Model (LLM) agents to enhance a backbone algorithm framework by automatically generating constraint-aware heuristic code, based on problem descriptions and several representative constraints selected from a database. Our experiments show that ARS outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based methods and commonly used solvers, automatically solving 91.67% of common VRPs and achieving at least a 30% improvement across all benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authorship is under discussion; arXiv release will follow finalization</p></details> |

These works typically claim that such domain-adaptive pretraining improves performance on various downstream medical tasks, such as answering medical exam questions. In this paper, we compare ten "medical" LLMs and two VLMs against their corresponding base models, arriving at a different conclusion: all medical VLMs and nearly all medical LLMs fail to consistently improve over their base models in the zero-/few-shot prompting and supervised fine-tuning regimes for medical question answering (QA). For instance, on clinical-note-based QA tasks in the 3-shot setting, medical LLMs outperform their base models in only 26.7% of cases, reach a (statistical) tie in 16.7% of cases, and perform significantly worse in the remaining 56.7% of cases. Our conclusions are based on (i) comparing each medical model directly against its base model; (ii) optimizing the prompts for each model separately in zero-/few-shot prompting; and (iii) accounting for statistical uncertainty in comparisons. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art general-domain models may already exhibit strong medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities, and offer recommendations to strengthen the conclusions of future studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of EMNLP 2024 paper arXiv:2411.04118.

Security professionals are increasingly burdened by the sheer volume and complexity of information, creating an urgent need for effective tools to navigate, synthesize, and act on large-scale data to counter evolving threats proactively. However, conventional threat intelligence tools often fail to scale with the dynamic nature of this data and lack the adaptability to support diverse threat intelligence tasks. In this work, we introduce CYLENS, a cyber threat intelligence copilot powered by large language models (LLMs). CYLENS is designed to assist security professionals throughout the entire threat management lifecycle, supporting threat attribution, contextualization, detection, correlation, prioritization, and remediation. To ensure domain expertise, CYLENS integrates knowledge from 271,570 threat reports into its model parameters and incorporates six specialized NLP modules to enhance reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, CYLENS can be customized to meet the unique needs of different or ganizations, underscoring its adaptability. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that CYLENS consistently outperforms industry-leading LLMs and state-of-the-art cybersecurity agents. By detailing its design, development, and evaluation, this work provides a blueprint for leveraging LLMs to address complex, data-intensive cybersecurity challenges.</p></details> |  |

This phenomenon, commonly referred to as a ''phase transition'', remains poorly understood. In this study, we conduct an integrative analysis of such phase transitions by examining three interconnected perspectives: the similarity between LLMs and the human brain, the internal states of LLMs, and downstream task performance. We propose a novel interpretation for the learning dynamics of LLMs that vary in both training data and architecture, revealing that three phase transitions commonly emerge across these models during training: (1) alignment with the entire brain surges as LLMs begin adhering to task instructions Brain Alignment and Instruction Following, (2) unexpectedly, LLMs diverge from the brain during a period in which downstream task accuracy temporarily stagnates Brain Detachment and Stagnation, and (3) alignment with the brain reoccurs as LLMs become capable of solving the downstream tasks Brain Realignment and Consolidation. These findings illuminate the underlying mechanisms of phase transitions in LLMs, while opening new avenues for interdisciplinary research bridging AI and neuroscience.</p></details> | 46 pages |

However, we find that existing vision-language alignment methods fail to transfer the existing safety mechanism for text in LLMs to vision, which leads to vulnerabilities in toxic image. To explore the cause of this problem, we give the insightful explanation of where and how the safety mechanism of LVLMs operates and conduct comparative analysis between text and vision. We find that the hidden states at the specific transformer layers play a crucial role in the successful activation of safety mechanism, while the vision-language alignment at hidden states level in current methods is insufficient. This results in a semantic shift for input images compared to text in hidden states, therefore misleads the safety mechanism. To address this, we propose a novel Text-Guided vision-language Alignment method (TGA) for LVLMs. TGA retrieves the texts related to input vision and uses them to guide the projection of vision into the hidden states space in LLMs. Experiments show that TGA not only successfully transfers the safety mechanism for text in basic LLMs to vision in vision-language alignment for LVLMs without any safety fine-tuning on the visual modality but also maintains the general performance on various vision tasks (Safe and Good).</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

However, they are prone to suffer from object hallucination, i.e., the generated image descriptions contain objects that do not exist in the image. In this paper, we reveal that object hallucination can be attributed to overconfidence in irrelevant visual features when soft visual tokens map to the LLM's word embedding space. Specifically, by figuring out the semantic similarity between visual tokens and LLM's word embedding, we observe that the smoothness of similarity distribution strongly correlates with the emergence of object hallucinations. To mitigate hallucinations, we propose using the Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) to alleviate overconfidence by introducing stochastic noise, facilitating the constraining of irrelevant information. Furthermore, we propose an entropy-based noise-controlling strategy to enable the injected noise to be adaptively constrained regarding the smoothness of the similarity distribution. We adapt the proposed AdaVIB across distinct model architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed AdaVIB mitigates object hallucinations by effectively alleviating the overconfidence in irrelevant visual features, with consistent improvements on two object hallucination benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025.

In this study, we tested four leading LLMs -- GPT-4o mini, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and LLaMA 3.2 90B Vision -- on 70 Java commits from both private and public repositories. By setting each model's temperature to zero, clearing context, and repeating the exact same prompts five times, we measured how consistently each model generated code-review assessments. Our results reveal that even with temperature minimized, LLM responses varied to different degrees. These findings highlight a consideration about the inherently limited consistency (test-retest reliability) of LLMs -- even when the temperature is set to zero -- and the need for caution when using LLM-generated code reviews to make real-world decisions.</p></details> |  |

Various parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have been devised to mitigate these challenges by training a small set of parameters for the task-specific updates of the model weights. Among PEFT methods, LoRA stands out for its simplicity and efficiency, inspiring the development of a series of variants. However, LoRA and its successors disregard the knowledge that is noisy or irrelevant to the targeted task, detrimentally impacting model performance and leading to suboptimality. To address this limitation, we introduce Knowledge-aware Singular-value Adaptation (KaSA), a PEFT method that leverages singular value decomposition (SVD) with knowledge-aware singular values to dynamically activate knowledge based on its relevance to the task at hand. We conduct extensive experiments across a range of LLMs on tasks spanning natural language understanding (NLU), generation (NLG), instruction following, and commonsense reasoning.

However, communication overheads from popular distributed inference techniques such as Tensor Parallelism pose a significant challenge to achieve scalability and low latency. Therefore, we introduce a novel optimization technique, Sync-Point Drop (SPD), to reduce communication overheads in tensor parallelism by selectively dropping synchronization on attention outputs. In detail, we first propose a block design that allows execution to proceed without communication through SPD. Second, we apply different SPD strategies to attention blocks based on their sensitivity to the model accuracy. The proposed methods effectively alleviate communication bottlenecks while minimizing accuracy degradation during LLM inference, offering a scalable solution for diverse distributed environments: SPD offered about 20% overall inference latency reduction with < 1% accuracy regression for LLaMA2-70B inference over 8 GPUs.</p></details> | Preprint |

The key insight is the organic integration of the frontier-based and sampling-based strategies that can achieve rapid global exploration of the environment. Specifically, a field-of-view-based (FOV) frontier detector with the guarantee of completeness and soundness is devised for identifying 3-D map frontiers. Different from random sampling-based methods, the deterministic sampling technique is employed to build and maintain an incremental road map based on the recorded sensor FOVs and newly detected frontiers. With the resulting road map, we propose a two-stage path planner. First, it quickly computes the global optimal exploration path on the road map using the lazy evaluation strategy. Then, the best exploration path is smoothed for further improving the exploration efficiency. We validate the proposed method both in simulation and real-world experiments. The comparative results demonstrate the promising performance of our planner in terms of exploration efficiency, computational time, and explored volume.</p></details> | <details><summary>13pag...</summary><p>13pages, 12 figures, accepted by IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement</p></details> |

This model efficiently handles large-scale candidate item screening by separating user and item representations. However, the decoupling network also leads to a neglect of potential information interaction between the user and item representations. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches include adding a shallow fully connected layer(i.e., COLD), which is limited by performance and can only be used in the ranking stage. For performance considerations, another approach attempts to capture historical positive interaction information from the other tower by regarding them as the input features(i.e., DAT). Later research showed that the gains achieved by this method are still limited because of lacking the guidance on the next user intent. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a "cross-interaction decoupling architecture" within our matching paradigm. This user-tower architecture leverages a diffusion module to reconstruct the next positive intention representation and employs a mixed-attention module to facilitate comprehensive cross-interaction. During the next positive intention generation, we further enhance the accuracy of its reconstruction by explicitly extracting the temporal drift within user behavior sequences. Experiments on two real-world datasets and one industrial dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the SOTA two-tower models significantly, and our diffusion approach outperforms other generative models in reconstructing item representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[EdgeLLM: A Highly Efficient CPU-FPGA Heterogeneous Edge Accelerator for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21325v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly the Large Language Models (LLMs), have profoundly affected our daily work and communication forms. However, it is still a challenge to deploy LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices (such as robots), due to the intensive computation requirements, heavy memory access, diverse operator types and difficulties in compilation. In this work, we proposed EdgeLLM to address the above issues. Firstly, focusing on the computation, we designed mix-precision processing element array together with group systolic architecture, that can efficiently support both FP16*FP16 for the MHA block (Multi-Head Attention) and FP16*INT4 for the FFN layer (Feed-Forward Network). Meanwhile specific optimization on log-scale structured weight sparsity, has been used to further increase the efficiency. Secondly, to address the compilation and deployment issue, we analyzed the whole operators within LLM models and developed a universal data parallelism scheme, by which all of the input and output features maintain the same data shape, enabling to process different operators without any data rearrangement. Then we proposed an end-to-end compiler to map the whole LLM model on CPU-FPGA heterogeneous system (AMD Xilinx VCU128 FPGA). The accelerator achieves 1.91x higher throughput and 7.55x higher energy efficiency than the commercial GPU (NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80G). When compared with state-of-the-art FPGA accelerator of FlightLLM, it shows 10-24% better performance in terms of HBM bandwidth utilization, energy efficiency and LLM throughput.</p></details> |  |

To effectively handle the new data, models are required to detect semantic shifts, adapt to covariate shifts, and continuously update themselves. These challenges give rise to a variety of open-world tasks. However, existing open-world remote sensing studies typically train and test within a single dataset to simulate open-world conditions. Currently, there is a lack of large-scale benchmarks capable of evaluating multiple open-world tasks. In this paper, we introduce OpenEarthSensing, a large-scale fine-grained benchmark for open-world remote sensing. OpenEarthSensing includes 189 scene and objects categories, covering the vast majority of potential semantic shifts that may occur in the real world. Additionally, OpenEarthSensing encompasses five data domains with significant covariate shifts, including two RGB satellite domians, one RGB aerial domian, one MS RGB domian, and one infrared domian. The various domains provide a more comprehensive testbed for evaluating the generalization performance of open-world models. We conduct the baseline evaluation of current mainstream open-world tasks and methods on OpenEarthSensing, demonstrating that it serves as a challenging benchmark for open-world remote sensing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt-Guided Internal States for Hallucination Detection of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04847v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a variety of tasks in different domains. However, they sometimes generate responses that are logically coherent but factually incorrect or misleading, which is known as LLM hallucinations. Data-driven supervised methods train hallucination detectors by leveraging the internal states of LLMs, but detectors trained on specific domains often struggle to generalize well to other domains. In this paper, we aim to enhance the cross-domain performance of supervised detectors with only in-domain data. We propose a novel framework, prompt-guided internal states for hallucination detection of LLMs, namely PRISM. By utilizing appropriate prompts to guide changes to the structure related to text truthfulness in LLMs' internal states, we make this structure more salient and consistent across texts from different domains. We integrated our framework with existing hallucination detection methods and conducted experiments on datasets from different domains. The experimental results indicate that our framework significantly enhances the cross-domain generalization of existing hallucination detection methods.</p></details> |  |

Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising a versatile toolchain and large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for data collection, enabling automatic point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Secondly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. The corresponding visual data are generated using various rendering engines and advanced techniques, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). All data exhibit high visual quality. Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of the dataset. Thirdly, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model, which takes language instructions, current observations, and historical keyframes as input, and outputs flight actions directly. Extensive analyses and experiments are conducted, showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and OpenFly-Agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable promise in generating fluent abstractive summaries but they can produce hallucinated details not grounded in the source text. Regardless of the method of generating a summary, high quality automated evaluations remain an open area of investigation. This paper embarks on an exploration of text summarization with a diverse set of techniques, including TextRank, BART, Mistral-7B-Instruct, and OpenAI GPT-3.5-Turbo. The generated summaries are evaluated using traditional metrics such as the Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) Score and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) Score, as well as LLM-powered evaluation methods that directly assess a generated summary's consistency with the source text. We introduce a meta evaluation score which directly assesses the performance of the LLM evaluation system (prompt + model). We find that that all summarization models produce consistent summaries when tested on the XL-Sum dataset, exceeding the consistency of the reference summaries.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

The quality of hardware verification, \ie, detection and diagnosis of corner-case design bugs, is critically dependent on the quality of the assertions. There has been a considerable amount of research leveraging a blend of data-driven statistical analysis and static analysis to generate high-quality assertions from hardware design source code and design execution trace data. Despite such concerted effort, all prior research struggles to scale to industrial-scale large designs, generates too many low-quality assertions, often fails to capture subtle and non-trivial design functionality, and does not produce any easy-to-comprehend explanations of the generated assertions to understand assertions' suitability to different downstream validation tasks. Recently, with the advent of Large-Language Models (LLMs), there has been a widespread effort to leverage prompt engineering to generate assertions. However, there is little effort to quantitatively establish the effectiveness and suitability of various LLMs for assertion generation. In this paper, we present AssertionBench, a novel benchmark to evaluate LLMs' effectiveness for assertion generation quantitatively. AssertioBench contains 100 curated Verilog hardware designs from OpenCores and formally verified assertions for each design generated from GoldMine and HARM. We use AssertionBench to compare state-of-the-art LLMs to assess their effectiveness in inferring functionally correct assertions for hardware designs. Our experiments demonstrate how LLMs perform relative to each other, the benefits of using more in-context exemplars in generating a higher fraction of functionally correct assertions, and the significant room for improvement for LLM-based assertion generators.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 Pag...</summary><p>8 Pages, 3 Figures, Published in NAACL 2025</p></details> |

However, jailbreaking, a form of attack that induces LLMs to produce harmful content through carefully crafted prompts, presents a significant challenge to the safe and trustworthy development of LLMs. Previous jailbreak methods primarily exploited the internal properties or capabilities of LLMs, such as optimization-based jailbreak methods and methods that leveraged the model's context-learning abilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel jailbreak method, SQL Injection Jailbreak (SIJ), which targets the external properties of LLMs, specifically, the way LLMs construct input prompts. By injecting jailbreak information into user prompts, SIJ successfully induces the model to output harmful content. For open-source models, SIJ achieves near 100\% attack success rates on five well-known LLMs on the AdvBench and HEx-PHI, while incurring lower time costs compared to previous methods. For closed-source models, SIJ achieves an average attack success rate over 85\% across five models in the GPT and Doubao series. Additionally, SIJ exposes a new vulnerability in LLMs that urgently requires mitigation. To address this, we propose a simple defense method called Self-Reminder-Key to counter SIJ and demonstrate its effectiveness through experimental results. Our code is available at https://github.com/weiyezhimeng/SQL-Injection-Jailbreak.</p></details> |  |

Experimental evaluation on the WebNLG dataset showed that such a constructed system produces text of better quality (according to the BLEU and BLEURT metrics) than the same LLM prompted to directly produce outputs, and produces fewer hallucinations than a BART language model fine-tuned on the same data. Furthermore, at runtime, the approach generates text in a fraction of the processing time required by neural approaches, using only a single CPU</p></details> |  |

Personalized food recommendations can help address these challenges by tailoring meal plans to individual preferences, habits, and dietary restrictions. However, existing dietary recommendation systems often lack adaptability, fail to consider real-world constraints such as food ingredient availability, and require extensive user input, making them impractical for sustainable and scalable daily use. To address these limitations, we introduce NutriGen, a framework based on large language models (LLM) designed to generate personalized meal plans that align with user-defined dietary preferences and constraints. By building a personalized nutrition database and leveraging prompt engineering, our approach enables LLMs to incorporate reliable nutritional references like the USDA nutrition database while maintaining flexibility and ease-of-use. We demonstrate that LLMs have strong potential in generating accurate and user-friendly food recommendations, addressing key limitations in existing dietary recommendation systems by providing structured, practical, and scalable meal plans. Our evaluation shows that Llama 3.1 8B and GPT-3.5 Turbo achieve the lowest percentage errors of 1.55\% and 3.68\%, respectively, producing meal plans that closely align with user-defined caloric targets while minimizing deviation and improving precision. Additionally, we compared the performance of DeepSeek V3 against several established models to evaluate its potential in personalized nutrition planning.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies indicate that scaling-up and advanced design of the recommendation model can bring significant performance improvement. However, with a larger model scale, such prior studies have a significantly increasing gap from industry as they often neglect two fundamental challenges in industrial-scale applications. First, training and inference budgets are restricted for the model to be served, exceeding which may incur latency and impair user experience. Second, large-volume data arrive in a streaming mode with data distributions dynamically shifting, as new users/ads join and existing users/ads leave the system. We propose the External Large Foundation Model (ExFM) framework to address the overlooked challenges. Specifically, we develop external distillation and a data augmentation system (DAS) to control the computational cost of training/inference while maintaining high performance. We design the teacher in a way like a foundation model (FM) that can serve multiple students as vertical models (VMs) to amortize its building cost. We propose Auxiliary Head and Student Adapter to mitigate the data distribution gap between FM and VMs caused by the streaming data issue. Comprehensive experiments on internal industrial-scale applications and public datasets demonstrate significant performance gain by ExFM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the ACM Web Conference (WWW) 2025 Industrial Track as Oral Presentation</p></details> |

Current verification methods typically rely on analyzing the generated output to determine the source model. However, these techniques are susceptible to adversarial attacks, operate in a post-hoc manner, and may require access to the model weights to inject a verifiable fingerprint. In this paper, we propose a novel passive and non-invasive fingerprinting technique that operates in real-time and remains effective even under encrypted network traffic conditions. Our method leverages the intrinsic autoregressive generation nature of language models, which generate text one token at a time based on all previously generated tokens, creating a unique temporal pattern like a rhythm or heartbeat that persists even when the output is streamed over a network. We find that measuring the Inter-Token Times (ITTs)-time intervals between consecutive tokens-can identify different language models with high accuracy. We develop a Deep Learning (DL) pipeline to capture these timing patterns using network traffic analysis and evaluate it on 16 Small Language Models (SLMs) and 10 proprietary LLMs across different deployment scenarios, including local host machine (GPU/CPU), Local Area Network (LAN), Remote Network, and Virtual Private Network (VPN). The experimental results confirm that our proposed technique is effective and maintains high accuracy even when tested in different network conditions. This work opens a new avenue for model identification in real-world scenarios and contributes to more secure and trustworthy language model deployment.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers are now developing Large Time Series Models (LTSMs)-universal transformer-based models that use autoregressive prediction-to improve TSF. However, training LTSMs on heterogeneous time series data poses unique challenges, including diverse frequencies, dimensions, and patterns across datasets. Recent endeavors have studied and evaluated various design choices aimed at enhancing LTSM training and generalization capabilities. However, these design choices are typically studied and evaluated in isolation and are not benchmarked collectively. In this work, we introduce LTSM-Bundle, a comprehensive toolbox, and benchmark for training LTSMs, spanning pre-processing techniques, model configurations, and dataset configuration. It modularized and benchmarked LTSMs from multiple dimensions, encompassing prompting strategies, tokenization approaches, training paradigms, base model selection, data quantity, and dataset diversity. Furthermore, we combine the most effective design choices identified in our study. Empirical results demonstrate that this combination achieves superior zero-shot and few-shot performances compared to state-of-the-art LTSMs and traditional TSF methods on benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |

We introduce CS-PaperSum, a large-scale dataset of 91,919 papers from 31 top-tier computer science conferences, enriched with AI-generated structured summaries using ChatGPT. To assess summary quality, we conduct embedding alignment analysis and keyword overlap analysis, demonstrating strong preservation of key concepts. We further present a case study on AI research trends, highlighting shifts in methodologies and interdisciplinary crossovers, including the rise of self-supervised learning, retrieval-augmented generation, and multimodal AI. Our dataset enables automated literature analysis, research trend forecasting, and AI-driven scientific discovery, providing a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and scientific information retrieval systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training Large Neural Networks With Low-Dimensional Error Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20580v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training deep neural networks typically relies on backpropagating high dimensional error signals a computationally intensive process with little evidence supporting its implementation in the brain. However, since most tasks involve low-dimensional outputs, we propose that low-dimensional error signals may suffice for effective learning. To test this hypothesis, we introduce a novel local learning rule based on Feedback Alignment that leverages indirect, low-dimensional error feedback to train large networks. Our method decouples the backward pass from the forward pass, enabling precise control over error signal dimensionality while maintaining high-dimensional representations. We begin with a detailed theoretical derivation for linear networks, which forms the foundation of our learning framework, and extend our approach to nonlinear, convolutional, and transformer architectures. Remarkably, we demonstrate that even minimal error dimensionality on the order of the task dimensionality can achieve performance matching that of traditional backpropagation. Furthermore, our rule enables efficient training of convolutional networks, which have previously been resistant to Feedback Alignment methods, with minimal error. This breakthrough not only paves the way toward more biologically accurate models of learning but also challenges the conventional reliance on high-dimensional gradient signals in neural network training. Our findings suggest that low-dimensional error signals can be as effective as high-dimensional ones, prompting a reevaluation of gradient-based learning in high-dimensional systems. Ultimately, our work offers a fresh perspective on neural network optimization and contributes to understanding learning mechanisms in both artificial and biological systems.</p></details> |  |

Several authors have recently used ensemble techniques to show how scenarios involving multiple data distributions are best served by representations that are both richer than those obtained by regularizing for the best in-distribution performance, and richer than those obtained under the influence of the implicit sparsity bias of common stochastic gradient procedures. This contribution investigates the use of very high dropout rates instead of ensembles to obtain such rich representations. Although training a deep network from scratch using such dropout rates is virtually impossible, fine-tuning a large pre-trained model under such conditions is not only possible but also achieves out-of-distribution performances that exceed those of both ensembles and weight averaging methods such as model soups. This result has practical significance because the importance of the fine-tuning scenario has considerably grown in recent years. This result also provides interesting insights on the nature of rich representations and on the intrinsically linear nature of fine-tuning a large network using a comparatively small dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fine-...</summary><p>Fine-tuning with very large dropout outperforms weight-averaging and ensemble on ResNet and large vision transformer</p></details> |

However, growing concerns about hallucinations in LVLMs, where the generated text is inconsistent with the visual context, are becoming a major impediment to deploying these models in applications that demand guaranteed reliability. In this paper, we introduce a framework to address this challenge, ConfLVLM, which is grounded on conformal prediction to achieve finite-sample distribution-free statistical guarantees on the factuality of LVLM output. This framework treats an LVLM as a hypothesis generator, where each generated text detail (or claim) is considered an individual hypothesis. It then applies a statistical hypothesis testing procedure to verify each claim using efficient heuristic uncertainty measures to filter out unreliable claims before returning any responses to users. We conduct extensive experiments covering three representative application domains, including general scene understanding, medical radiology report generation, and document understanding. Remarkably, ConfLVLM reduces the error rate of claims generated by LLaVa-1.5 for scene descriptions from 87.8\% to 10.0\% by filtering out erroneous claims with a 95.3\% true positive rate. Our results further demonstrate that ConfLVLM is highly flexible, and can be applied to any black-box LVLMs paired with any uncertainty measure for any image-conditioned free-form text generation task while providing a rigorous guarantee on controlling the risk of hallucination.</p></details> |  |

Using simple games like Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, Battleship, and a Shape Recognition Game, all encoded in ASCII, we test strategic capabilities and spatial reasoning, core abilities any artificial intelligence would need to master for solving problems in chemistry. To probe generalization, we introduce two new games for spatial logic: LEGO Connect Language (LCL) and Guess-the-SMILES (GtS), a operationally simple chemistry benchmark. Our results show that GPT models provide meaningful responses for several tasks but, generally, perform poorly. A systematic performance progression with increased model capabilities (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o) is only observed for 4 out of the 7 benchmark tasks. All models consistently struggle with Battleship, LCL, and GtS. This suggests that while GPT models can emulate conversational proficiency and basic rule comprehension, they have limited generalization with respect to strategy and spatial reasoning. Particularly poor performance is observed for interpreting molecular graphs when encoded in ASCII. The results provided by our open-source benchmark suite (\href{https://github.com/BlueVelvetSackOfGoldPotatoes/child-play}{\texttt{ChildPlay} GitHub Repository}) caution against claims of emergent intelligence in GPT models, which appear more specialized than general.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to decode neuron weights directly into token probabilities through the final projection layer of the model (the LM-head). This is illustrated in Llama 3.1 8B where we use the LM-head to find examples of specialised feature neurons such as a "dog" neuron and a "California" neuron, and we validate this by clamping these neurons to affect the probability of the concept in the output. We evaluate this method on both the pre-trained and Instruct models, finding that over 75% of neurons in the up-projection layers in the instruct model have the same top associated token compared to the pretrained model. Finally, we demonstrate that clamping the "dog" neuron leads the instruct model to always discuss dogs when asked about its favourite animal. Through our method, it is possible to map the top features of the entirety of Llama 3.1 8B's up-projection neurons in less than 10 seconds, with minimal compute.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |

Should qualitative researchers use large language models (LLMs) as part of their practice? LLMs could augment qualitative research, but it is unclear if their use is appropriate, ethical, or aligned with qualitative researchers' goals and values. We interviewed twenty qualitative researchers to investigate these tensions. Many participants see LLMs as promising interlocutors with attractive use cases across the stages of research, but wrestle with their performance and appropriateness. Participants surface concerns regarding the use of LLMs while protecting participant interests, and call attention to an urgent lack of norms and tooling to guide the ethical use of LLMs in research. We document the rapid and broad adoption of LLMs across surfaces, which can interfere with intentional use vital to qualitative research. We use the tensions surfaced by our participants to outline recommendations for researchers considering using LLMs in qualitative research and design principles for LLM-assisted qualitative research tools.</p></details> |  |

Our analysis shows that these distortions severely harm multimodal large language models, reducing their question-answering accuracy to the level of the random baseline. To mitigate this vulnerability, we introduce six inference-time methods to improve performance of MLLMs on misleading visualizations while preserving their accuracy on non-misleading ones. The most effective approach involves (1) extracting the underlying data table and (2) using a text-only large language model to answer questions based on the table.

To bridge this gap, we introduce an evaluation framework grounded in behavioral game theory, disentangling reasoning capability from contextual effects. Testing 22 state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that GPT-o3-mini, GPT-o1, and DeepSeek-R1 dominate most games yet also demonstrate that the model scale alone does not determine performance. In terms of prompting enhancement, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is not universally effective, as it increases strategic reasoning only for models at certain levels while providing limited gains elsewhere. Additionally, we investigate the impact of encoded demographic features on the models, observing that certain assignments impact the decision-making pattern. For instance, GPT-4o shows stronger strategic reasoning with female traits than males, while Gemma assigns higher reasoning levels to heterosexual identities compared to other sexual orientations, indicating inherent biases. These findings underscore the need for ethical standards and contextual alignment to balance improved reasoning with fairness.</p></details> |  |

Although LLMs possess impressive capabilities, their internal mechanisms for processing and representing linguistic knowledge remain largely opaque. Previous work on linguistic mechanisms has been limited by coarse granularity, insufficient causal analysis, and a narrow focus. In this study, we present a systematic and comprehensive causal investigation using sparse auto-encoders (SAEs). We extract a wide range of linguistic features from six dimensions: phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. We extract, evaluate, and intervene on these features by constructing minimal contrast datasets and counterfactual sentence datasets. We introduce two indices-Feature Representation Confidence (FRC) and Feature Intervention Confidence (FIC)-to measure the ability of linguistic features to capture and control linguistic phenomena. Our results reveal inherent representations of linguistic knowledge in LLMs and demonstrate the potential for controlling model outputs. This work provides strong evidence that LLMs possess genuine linguistic knowledge and lays the foundation for more interpretable and controllable language modeling in future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emergent Symbolic Mechanisms Support Abstract Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20332v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many recent studies have found evidence for emergent reasoning capabilities in large language models, but debate persists concerning the robustness of these capabilities, and the extent to which they depend on structured reasoning mechanisms. To shed light on these issues, we perform a comprehensive study of the internal mechanisms that support abstract rule induction in an open-source language model (Llama3-70B). We identify an emergent symbolic architecture that implements abstract reasoning via a series of three computations. In early layers, symbol abstraction heads convert input tokens to abstract variables based on the relations between those tokens. In intermediate layers, symbolic induction heads perform sequence induction over these abstract variables. Finally, in later layers, retrieval heads predict the next token by retrieving the value associated with the predicted abstract variable. These results point toward a resolution of the longstanding debate between symbolic and neural network approaches, suggesting that emergent reasoning in neural networks depends on the emergence of symbolic mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[BioMaze: Benchmarking and Enhancing Large Language Models for Biological Pathway Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16660v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The applications of large language models (LLMs) in various biological domains have been explored recently, but their reasoning ability in complex biological systems, such as pathways, remains underexplored, which is crucial for predicting biological phenomena, formulating hypotheses, and designing experiments. This work explores the potential of LLMs in pathway reasoning. We introduce BioMaze, a dataset with 5.1K complex pathway problems derived from real research, covering various biological contexts including natural dynamic changes, disturbances, additional intervention conditions, and multi-scale research targets. Our evaluation of methods such as CoT and graph-augmented reasoning, shows that LLMs struggle with pathway reasoning, especially in perturbed systems. To address this, we propose PathSeeker, an LLM agent that enhances reasoning through interactive subgraph-based navigation, enabling a more effective approach to handling the complexities of biological systems in a scientifically aligned manner. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/zhao-ht/BioMaze.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformal Tail Risk Control for Large Language Model Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20285v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have led to their widespread usage for various tasks. The prevalence of LLMs in society implores the assurance on the reliability of their performance. In particular, risk-sensitive applications demand meticulous attention to unexpectedly poor outcomes, i.e., tail events, for instance, toxic answers, humiliating language, and offensive outputs. Due to the costly nature of acquiring human annotations, general-purpose scoring models have been created to automate the process of quantifying these tail events. This phenomenon introduces potential human-machine misalignment between the respective scoring mechanisms. In this work, we present a lightweight calibration framework for blackbox models that ensures the alignment of humans and machines with provable guarantees. Our framework provides a rigorous approach to controlling any distortion risk measure that is characterized by a weighted average of quantiles of the loss incurred by the LLM with high confidence. The theoretical foundation of our method relies on the connection between conformal risk control and a traditional family of statistics, i.e., L-statistics. To demonstrate the utility of our framework, we conduct comprehensive experiments that address the issue of human-machine misalignment.</p></details> |  |

However, effectively leveraging their vast knowledge for training smaller downstream models remains an open challenge, especially in domains like tabular data learning, where simpler models are often preferred due to interpretability and efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a novel yet straightforward method for incorporating LLM-generated global task feature attributions into the training process of smaller networks. Specifically, we propose an attribution-matching regularization term that aligns the training dynamics of the smaller model with the insights provided by the LLM. By doing so, our approach yields superior performance in few-shot learning scenarios. Notably, our method requires only black-box API access to the LLM, making it easy to integrate into existing training pipelines with minimal computational overhead. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this method can be used to address common issues in real-world datasets, such as skewness and bias. By integrating high-level knowledge from LLMs, our approach improves generalization, even when training data is limited or imbalanced. We validate its effectiveness through extensive experiments across multiple tasks, demonstrating improved learning efficiency and model robustness.</p></details> |  |

However, modeling voter behavior presents unique challenges due to limited voter-level data, evolving political landscapes, and the complexity of human reasoning. In this study, we develop a theory-driven, multi-step reasoning framework that integrates demographic, temporal and ideological factors to simulate voter decision-making at scale. Using synthetic personas calibrated to real-world voter data, we conduct large-scale simulations of recent U.S. presidential elections. Our method significantly improves simulation accuracy while mitigating model biases. We examine its robustness by comparing performance across different LLMs. We further investigate the challenges and constraints that arise from LLM-based political simulations. Our work provides both a scalable framework for modeling political decision-making behavior and insights into the promise and limitations of using LLMs in political science research.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2411.03321 This version adds a new model to our experimental setup, modifies the paper's main discussion, and updates the authorship list</p></details> |

In this paper, to understand the qualities of these long CoTs and measure the critique abilities of existing LLMs on these long CoTs, we introduce the DeltaBench, including the generated long CoTs from different o1-like models (e.g., QwQ, DeepSeek-R1) for different reasoning tasks (e.g., Math, Code, General Reasoning), to measure the ability to detect errors in long CoT reasoning. Based on DeltaBench, we first perform fine-grained analysis of the generated long CoTs to discover the effectiveness and efficiency of different o1-like models. Then, we conduct extensive evaluations of existing process reward models (PRMs) and critic models to detect the errors of each annotated process, which aims to investigate the boundaries and limitations of existing PRMs and critic models. Finally, we hope that DeltaBench could guide developers to better understand the long CoT reasoning abilities of their models.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first four authors contributed equally, 27 pages</p></details> |

However, existing datasets lack the scope, metadata, and decryption capabilities required for robust benchmarking in encrypted traffic research. We introduce VisQUIC, a large-scale dataset of 100,000 labeled QUIC traces from over 44,000 websites, collected over four months. Unlike prior datasets, VisQUIC provides SSL keys for controlled decryption, supports multiple QUIC implementations (Chromium QUIC, Facebooks mvfst, Cloudflares quiche), and introduces a novel image-based representation that enables machine learning-driven encrypted traffic analysis. The dataset includes standardized benchmarking tools, ensuring reproducibility. To demonstrate VisQUICs utility, we present a benchmarking task for estimating HTTP/3 responses in encrypted QUIC traffic, achieving 97% accuracy using only observable packet features.

To address this shortcoming, we present Avat3r, which regresses a high-quality and animatable 3D head avatar from just a few input images, vastly reducing compute requirements during inference. More specifically, we make Large Reconstruction Models animatable and learn a powerful prior over 3D human heads from a large multi-view video dataset. For better 3D head reconstructions, we employ position maps from DUSt3R and generalized feature maps from the human foundation model Sapiens. To animate the 3D head, our key discovery is that simple cross-attention to an expression code is already sufficient. Finally, we increase robustness by feeding input images with different expressions to our model during training, enabling the reconstruction of 3D head avatars from inconsistent inputs, e.g., an imperfect phone capture with accidental movement, or frames from a monocular video. We compare Avat3r with current state-of-the-art methods for few-input and single-input scenarios, and find that our method has a competitive advantage in both tasks. Finally, we demonstrate the wide applicability of our proposed model, creating 3D head avatars from images of different sources, smartphone captures, single images, and even out-of-domain inputs like antique busts.

| **[MARVEL: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for constrained field-of-View multi-robot Exploration in Large-scale environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20217v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multi-robot exploration, a team of mobile robot is tasked with efficiently mapping an unknown environments. While most exploration planners assume omnidirectional sensors like LiDAR, this is impractical for small robots such as drones, where lightweight, directional sensors like cameras may be the only option due to payload constraints. These sensors have a constrained field-of-view (FoV), which adds complexity to the exploration problem, requiring not only optimal robot positioning but also sensor orientation during movement. In this work, we propose MARVEL, a neural framework that leverages graph attention networks, together with novel frontiers and orientation features fusion technique, to develop a collaborative, decentralized policy using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for robots with constrained FoV. To handle the large action space of viewpoints planning, we further introduce a novel information-driven action pruning strategy. MARVEL improves multi-robot coordination and decision-making in challenging large-scale indoor environments, while adapting to various team sizes and sensor configurations (i.e., FoV and sensor range) without additional training. Our extensive evaluation shows that MARVEL's learned policies exhibit effective coordinated behaviors, outperforming state-of-the-art exploration planners across multiple metrics. We experimentally demonstrate MARVEL's generalizability in large-scale environments, of up to 90m by 90m, and validate its practical applicability through successful deployment on a team of real drone hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>\c{op...</summary><p>\c{opyright} 20XX IEEE.

| **[ChineseEcomQA: A Scalable E-commerce Concept Evaluation Benchmark for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20196v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in fields such as e-commerce, domain-specific concept evaluation benchmarks are crucial for assessing their domain capabilities. Existing LLMs may generate factually incorrect information within the complex e-commerce applications. Therefore, it is necessary to build an e-commerce concept benchmark. Existing benchmarks encounter two primary challenges: (1) handle the heterogeneous and diverse nature of tasks, (2) distinguish between generality and specificity within the e-commerce field. To address these problems, we propose \textbf{ChineseEcomQA}, a scalable question-answering benchmark focused on fundamental e-commerce concepts. ChineseEcomQA is built on three core characteristics: \textbf{Focus on Fundamental Concept}, \textbf{E-commerce Generality} and \textbf{E-commerce Expertise}. Fundamental concepts are designed to be applicable across a diverse array of e-commerce tasks, thus addressing the challenge of heterogeneity and diversity. Additionally, by carefully balancing generality and specificity, ChineseEcomQA effectively differentiates between broad e-commerce concepts, allowing for precise validation of domain capabilities. We achieve this through a scalable benchmark construction process that combines LLM validation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) validation, and rigorous manual annotation. Based on ChineseEcomQA, we conduct extensive evaluations on mainstream LLMs and provide some valuable insights. We hope that ChineseEcomQA could guide future domain-specific evaluations, and facilitate broader LLM adoption in e-commerce applications.</p></details> |  |

Modern generalist models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), decidedly outpace this paradigm. Open-ended evaluation systems, where candidate models are compared on user-submitted prompts, have emerged as a popular solution. Despite their many advantages, we show that the current Elo-based rating systems can be susceptible to and even reinforce biases in data, intentional or accidental, due to their sensitivity to redundancies. To address this issue, we propose evaluation as a 3-player game, and introduce novel game-theoretic solution concepts to ensure robustness to redundancy. We show that our method leads to intuitive ratings and provide insights into the competitive landscape of LLM development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

| **[Toward Foundational Model for Sleep Analysis Using a Multimodal Hybrid Self-Supervised Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17481v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sleep is essential for maintaining human health and quality of life. Analyzing physiological signals during sleep is critical in assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders. However, manual diagnoses by clinicians are time-intensive and subjective. Despite advances in deep learning that have enhanced automation, these approaches remain heavily dependent on large-scale labeled datasets. This study introduces SynthSleepNet, a multimodal hybrid self-supervised learning framework designed for analyzing polysomnography (PSG) data. SynthSleepNet effectively integrates masked prediction and contrastive learning to leverage complementary features across multiple modalities, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), and electrocardiogram (ECG). This approach enables the model to learn highly expressive representations of PSG data. Furthermore, a temporal context module based on Mamba was developed to efficiently capture contextual information across signals. SynthSleepNet achieved superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across three downstream tasks: sleep-stage classification, apnea detection, and hypopnea detection, with accuracies of 89.89%, 99.75%, and 89.60%, respectively. The model demonstrated robust performance in a semi-supervised learning environment with limited labels, achieving accuracies of 87.98%, 99.37%, and 77.52% in the same tasks. These results underscore the potential of the model as a foundational tool for the comprehensive analysis of PSG data. SynthSleepNet demonstrates comprehensively superior performance across multiple downstream tasks compared to other methodologies, making it expected to set a new standard for sleep disorder monitoring and diagnostic systems.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Foundation Models -- A Panacea for Artificial Intelligence in Pathology?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21264v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in pathology has evolved from aiding diagnostics to uncovering predictive morphological patterns in whole slide images (WSIs). Recently, foundation models (FMs) leveraging self-supervised pre-training have been widely advocated as a universal solution for diverse downstream tasks. However, open questions remain about their clinical applicability and generalization advantages over end-to-end learning using task-specific (TS) models. Here, we focused on AI with clinical-grade performance for prostate cancer diagnosis and Gleason grading. We present the largest validation of AI for this task, using over 100,000 core needle biopsies from 7,342 patients across 15 sites in 11 countries. We compared two FMs with a fully end-to-end TS model in a multiple instance learning framework. Our findings challenge assumptions that FMs universally outperform TS models. While FMs demonstrated utility in data-scarce scenarios, their performance converged with - and was in some cases surpassed by - TS models when sufficient labeled training data were available. Notably, extensive task-specific training markedly reduced clinically significant misgrading, misdiagnosis of challenging morphologies, and variability across different WSI scanners. Additionally, FMs used up to 35 times more energy than the TS model, raising concerns about their sustainability. Our results underscore that while FMs offer clear advantages for rapid prototyping and research, their role as a universal solution for clinically applicable medical AI remains uncertain. For high-stakes clinical applications, rigorous validation and consideration of task-specific training remain critically important. We advocate for integrating the strengths of FMs and end-to-end learning to achieve robust and resource-efficient AI pathology solutions fit for clinical use.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 15 figures and an appendix (study protocol) which is previously published, see https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.04.24309948</p></details> |
| **[Cell-ontology guided transcriptome foundation model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12373v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transcriptome foundation models TFMs hold great promises of deciphering the transcriptomic language that dictate diverse cell functions by self-supervised learning on large-scale single-cell gene expression data, and ultimately unraveling the complex mechanisms of human diseases. However, current TFMs treat cells as independent samples and ignore the taxonomic relationships between cell types, which are available in cell ontology graphs. We argue that effectively leveraging this ontology information during the TFM pre-training can improve learning biologically meaningful gene co-expression patterns while preserving TFM as a general purpose foundation model for downstream zero-shot and fine-tuning tasks. To this end, we present single cell, Cell-ontology guided TFM scCello. We introduce cell-type coherence loss and ontology alignment loss, which are minimized along with the masked gene expression prediction loss during the pre-training. The novel loss component guide scCello to learn the cell-type-specific representation and the structural relation between cell types from the cell ontology graph, respectively. We pre-trained scCello on 22 million cells from CellxGene database leveraging their cell-type labels mapped to the cell ontology graph from Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology Foundry. Our TFM demonstrates competitive generalization and transferability performance over the existing TFMs on biologically important tasks including identifying novel cell types of unseen cells, prediction of cell-type-specific marker genes, and cancer drug responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024 as Spotlight</p></details> |

However, these claims have yet to be thoroughly validated empirically. Recently, foundation models have demonstrated unparalleled capabilities across diverse domains, from language to computer vision, positioning them as a potential cornerstone of future research for a wide range of computational tasks. In this paper, we conduct an extensive empirical study on representation learning for downstream Visual Question Answering (VQA), which requires an accurate compositional understanding of the scene. We thoroughly investigate the benefits and trade-offs of OC models and alternative approaches including large pre-trained foundation models on both synthetic and real-world data, ultimately identifying a promising path to leverage the strengths of both paradigms. The extensiveness of our study, encompassing over 600 downstream VQA models and 15 different types of upstream representations, also provides several additional insights that we believe will be of interest to the community at large.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimesBERT: A BERT-Style Foundation Model for Time Series Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21245v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis is crucial in diverse scenarios. Beyond forecasting, considerable real-world tasks are categorized into classification, imputation, and anomaly detection, underscoring different capabilities termed time series understanding in this paper. While GPT-style models have been positioned as foundation models for time series forecasting, the BERT-style architecture, which has made significant advances in natural language understanding, has not been fully unlocked for time series understanding, possibly attributed to the undesirable dropout of essential elements of BERT. In this paper, inspired by the shared multi-granularity structure between multivariate time series and multisentence documents, we design TimesBERT to learn generic representations of time series including temporal patterns and variate-centric characteristics. In addition to a natural adaptation of masked modeling, we propose a parallel task of functional token prediction to embody vital multi-granularity structures. Our model is pre-trained on 260 billion time points across diverse domains. Leveraging multi-granularity representations, TimesBERT achieves state-of-the-art performance across four typical downstream understanding tasks, outperforming task-specific models and language pre-trained backbones, positioning it as a versatile foundation model for time series understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distilling foundation models for robust and efficient models in digital pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16239v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the advent of foundation models (FM) for digital pathology has relied heavily on scaling the pre-training datasets and the model size, yielding large and powerful models. While it resulted in improving the performance on diverse downstream tasks, it also introduced increased computational cost and inference time. In this work, we explore the distillation of a large foundation model into a smaller one, reducing the number of parameters by several orders of magnitude. Leveraging distillation techniques, our distilled model, H0-mini, achieves nearly comparable performance to large FMs at a significantly reduced inference cost. It is evaluated on several public benchmarks, achieving 3rd place on the HEST benchmark and 5th place on the EVA benchmark. Additionally, a robustness analysis conducted on the PLISM dataset demonstrates that our distilled model reaches excellent robustness to variations in staining and scanning conditions, significantly outperforming other state-of-the art models. This opens new perspectives to design lightweight and robust models for digital pathology, without compromising on performance.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Causality Is Key to Understand and Balance Multiple Goals in Trustworthy ML and Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21123v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring trustworthiness in machine learning (ML) systems is crucial as they become increasingly embedded in high-stakes domains. This paper advocates for the integration of causal methods into machine learning to navigate the trade-offs among key principles of trustworthy ML, including fairness, privacy, robustness, accuracy, and explainability. While these objectives should ideally be satisfied simultaneously, they are often addressed in isolation, leading to conflicts and suboptimal solutions. Drawing on existing applications of causality in ML that successfully align goals such as fairness and accuracy or privacy and robustness, this paper argues that a causal approach is essential for balancing multiple competing objectives in both trustworthy ML and foundation models. Beyond highlighting these trade-offs, we examine how causality can be practically integrated into ML and foundation models, offering solutions to enhance their reliability and interpretability. Finally, we discuss the challenges, limitations, and opportunities in adopting causal frameworks, paving the way for more accountable and ethically sound AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Non-contrast Head CT Foundation Model for Comprehensive Neuro-Trauma Triage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21106v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in AI and medical imaging offer transformative potential in emergency head CT interpretation for reducing assessment times and improving accuracy in the face of an increasing request of such scans and a global shortage in radiologists. This study introduces a 3D foundation model for detecting diverse neuro-trauma findings with high accuracy and efficiency. Using large language models (LLMs) for automatic labeling, we generated comprehensive multi-label annotations for critical conditions. Our approach involved pretraining neural networks for hemorrhage subtype segmentation and brain anatomy parcellation, which were integrated into a pretrained comprehensive neuro-trauma detection network through multimodal fine-tuning. Performance evaluation against expert annotations and comparison with CT-CLIP demonstrated strong triage accuracy across major neuro-trauma findings, such as hemorrhage and midline shift, as well as less frequent critical conditions such as cerebral edema and arterial hyperdensity. The integration of neuro-specific features significantly enhanced diagnostic capabilities, achieving an average AUC of 0.861 for 16 neuro-trauma conditions. This work advances foundation models in medical imaging, serving as a benchmark for future AI-assisted neuro-trauma diagnostics in emergency radiology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are foundation models useful feature extractors for electroencephalography analysis?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21086v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of foundation models in natural language processing and computer vision has motivated similar approaches for general time series analysis. While these models are effective for a variety of tasks, their applicability in medical domains with limited data remains largely unexplored. To address this, we investigate the effectiveness of foundation models in medical time series analysis involving electroencephalography (EEG). Through extensive experiments on tasks such as age prediction, seizure detection, and the classification of clinically relevant EEG events, we compare their diagnostic accuracy with that of specialised EEG models. Our analysis shows that foundation models extract meaningful EEG features, outperform specialised models even without domain adaptation, and localise task-specific biomarkers. Moreover, we demonstrate that diagnostic accuracy is substantially influenced by architectural choices such as context length. Overall, our study reveals that foundation models with general time series understanding eliminate the dependency on large domain-specific datasets, making them valuable tools for clinical practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can We Simplify Slide-level Fine-tuning of Pathology Foundation Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20823v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of foundation models in computational pathology has transformed histopathological image analysis, with whole slide imaging (WSI) diagnosis being a core application. Traditionally, weakly supervised fine-tuning via multiple instance learning (MIL) has been the primary method for adapting foundation models to WSIs. However, in this work we present a key experimental finding: a simple nonlinear mapping strategy combining mean pooling and a multilayer perceptron, called SiMLP, can effectively adapt patch-level foundation models to slide-level tasks without complex MIL-based learning. Through extensive experiments across diverse downstream tasks, we demonstrate the superior performance of SiMLP with state-of-the-art methods. For instance, on a large-scale pan-cancer classification task, SiMLP surpasses popular MIL-based methods by 3.52%. Furthermore, SiMLP shows strong learning ability in few-shot classification and remaining highly competitive with slide-level foundation models pretrained on tens of thousands of slides. Finally, SiMLP exhibits remarkable robustness and transferability in lung cancer subtyping. Overall, our findings challenge the conventional MIL-based fine-tuning paradigm, demonstrating that a task-agnostic representation strategy alone can effectively adapt foundation models to WSI analysis. These insights offer a unique and meaningful perspective for future research in digital pathology, paving the way for more efficient and broadly applicable methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[SemiSAM+: Rethinking Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation in the Era of Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20749v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based medical image segmentation typically requires large amount of labeled data for training, making it less applicable in clinical settings due to high annotation cost. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as an appealing strategy due to its less dependence on acquiring abundant annotations from experts compared to fully supervised methods. Beyond existing model-centric advancements of SSL by designing novel regularization strategies, we anticipate a paradigmatic shift due to the emergence of promptable segmentation foundation models with universal segmentation capabilities using positional prompts represented by Segment Anything Model (SAM). In this paper, we present SemiSAM+, a foundation model-driven SSL framework to efficiently learn from limited labeled data for medical image segmentation. SemiSAM+ consists of one or multiple promptable foundation models as generalist models, and a trainable task-specific segmentation model as specialist model. For a given new segmentation task, the training is based on the specialist-generalist collaborative learning procedure, where the trainable specialist model delivers positional prompts to interact with the frozen generalist models to acquire pseudo-labels, and then the generalist model output provides the specialist model with informative and efficient supervision which benefits the automatic segmentation and prompt generation in turn. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one in-house clinical dataset demonstrate that SemiSAM+ achieves significant performance improvement, especially under extremely limited annotation scenarios, and shows strong efficiency as a plug-and-play strategy that can be easily adapted to different specialist and generalist models.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies indicate that scaling-up and advanced design of the recommendation model can bring significant performance improvement. However, with a larger model scale, such prior studies have a significantly increasing gap from industry as they often neglect two fundamental challenges in industrial-scale applications. First, training and inference budgets are restricted for the model to be served, exceeding which may incur latency and impair user experience. Second, large-volume data arrive in a streaming mode with data distributions dynamically shifting, as new users/ads join and existing users/ads leave the system. We propose the External Large Foundation Model (ExFM) framework to address the overlooked challenges. Specifically, we develop external distillation and a data augmentation system (DAS) to control the computational cost of training/inference while maintaining high performance. We design the teacher in a way like a foundation model (FM) that can serve multiple students as vertical models (VMs) to amortize its building cost.

| **[Vector-Quantized Vision Foundation Models for Object-Centric Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20263v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decomposing visual scenes into objects, as humans do, facilitates modeling object relations and dynamics. Object-Centric Learning (OCL) achieves this by aggregating image or video feature maps into object-level feature vectors, known as \textit{slots}. OCL's self-supervision via reconstructing the input from slots struggles with complex textures, thus many methods employ Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to extract feature maps with better objectness. However, using VFMs merely as feature extractors does not fully unlock their potential. We propose Vector-Quantized VFMs for OCL (VQ-VFM-OCL, or VVO), where VFM features are extracted to facilitate object-level information aggregation and further quantized to strengthen supervision in reconstruction. Our VVO unifies OCL representatives into a concise architecture. Experiments demonstrate that VVO not only outperforms mainstream methods on object discovery tasks but also benefits downstream tasks like visual prediction and reasoning.

Analogously, substantial evidence suggests that the human visual system (HVS) is influenced by the statistical distribution of colors and patterns in the natural world, characteristics also present in the training data of foundation models. The question we address in this paper is whether foundation models trained on natural images mimic some of the low-level characteristics of the human visual system, such as contrast detection, contrast masking, and contrast constancy. Specifically, we designed a protocol comprising nine test types to evaluate the image encoders of 45 foundation and generative models. Our results indicate that some foundation models (e.g., DINO, DINOv2, and OpenCLIP), share some of the characteristics of human vision, but other models show little resemblance. Foundation models tend to show smaller sensitivity to low contrast and rather irregular responses to contrast across frequencies. The foundation models show the best agreement with human data in terms of contrast masking. Our findings suggest that human vision and computer vision may take both similar and different paths when learning to interpret images of the real world. Overall, while differences remain, foundation models trained on vision tasks start to align with low-level human vision, with DINOv2 showing the closest resemblance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we propose a diffusion-based method that generates dance movements conditioned on text and music. Our approach extracts music features by combining high-level features obtained by music foundation model with hand-crafted features, thereby enhancing the quality of generated dance sequences. This method effectively leverages the advantages of high-level semantic information and low-level temporal details to improve the model's capability in music feature understanding. To show the merits of the proposed method, we compare it with four music foundation models and two sets of hand-crafted music features. The results demonstrate that our method obtains the most realistic dance sequences and achieves the best match with the input music.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the Audio Imagination Workshop of NeurlPS 2024</p></details> |

However, such solutions are not yet available for Tetun, making it challenging to find relevant documents for text-based search queries in this language. To address these challenges, this study investigates Tetun text retrieval with a focus on the ad-hoc retrieval task. It begins by developing essential language resources -- including a list of stopwords, a stemmer, and a test collection -- which serve as foundational components for solutions tailored to Tetun text retrieval. Various strategies are then explored using both document titles and content to evaluate retrieval effectiveness. The results show that retrieving document titles, after removing hyphens and apostrophes without applying stemming, significantly improves retrieval performance compared to the baseline. Efficiency increases by 31.37%, while effectiveness achieves an average gain of 9.40% in MAP@10 and 30.35% in nDCG@10 with DFR BM25. Beyond the top-10 cutoff point, Hiemstra LM demonstrates strong performance across various retrieval strategies and evaluation metrics. Contributions of this work include the development of Labadain-Stopwords (a list of 160 Tetun stopwords), Labadain-Stemmer (a Tetun stemmer with three variants), and Labadain-Avaliad\'or (a Tetun test collection containing 59 topics, 33,550 documents, and 5,900 qrels).</p></details> | <details><summary>Refin...</summary><p>Refine the title and improve the content (version 2)</p></details> |

Traditional methods use statistical analysis, abnormal data synthesis modeling, and generation-based models to separate product defect features and complete defect detection. Recently, the emergence of foundation models has brought visual and textual semantic prior knowledge. Many methods are based on foundation models (FM) to improve the accuracy of detection, but at the same time, increase model complexity and slow down inference speed. Some FM-based methods have begun to explore lightweight modeling ways, which have gradually attracted attention and deserve to be systematically analyzed. In this paper, we conduct a systematic survey with comparisons and discussions of foundation model methods from different aspects and briefly review non-foundation model (NFM) methods recently published. Furthermore, we discuss the differences between FM and NFM methods from training objectives, model structure and scale, model performance, and potential directions for future exploration. Through comparison, we find FM methods are more suitable for few-shot and zero-shot learning, which are more in line with actual industrial application scenarios and worthy of in-depth research.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Mixtera: A Data Plane for Foundation Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19790v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art large language and vision models are trained over trillions of tokens that are aggregated from a large variety of sources. As training data collections grow, manually managing the samples becomes time-consuming, tedious, and prone to errors. Yet recent research shows that the data mixture and the order in which samples are visited during training can significantly influence model accuracy. We build and present Mixtera, a data plane for foundation model training that enables users to declaratively express which data samples should be used in which proportion and in which order during training. Mixtera is a centralized, read-only layer that is deployed on top of existing training data collections and can be declaratively queried. It operates independently of the filesystem structure and supports mixtures across arbitrary properties (e.g., language, source dataset) as well as dynamic adjustment of the mixture based on model feedback. We experimentally evaluate Mixtera and show that our implementation does not bottleneck training and scales to 256 GH200 superchips. We demonstrate how Mixtera supports recent advancements in mixing strategies by implementing the proposed Adaptive Data Optimization (ADO) algorithm in the system and evaluating its performance impact. We also explore the role of mixtures for vision-language models.</p></details> | under submission |
| **[Time-MoE: Billion-Scale Time Series Foundation Models with Mixture of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16040v4)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning for time series forecasting has seen significant advancements over the past decades. However, despite the success of large-scale pre-training in language and vision domains, pre-trained time series models remain limited in scale and operate at a high cost, hindering the development of larger capable forecasting models in real-world applications. In response, we introduce Time-MoE, a scalable and unified architecture designed to pre-train larger, more capable forecasting foundation models while reducing inference costs. By leveraging a sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) design, Time-MoE enhances computational efficiency by activating only a subset of networks for each prediction, reducing computational load while maintaining high model capacity. This allows Time-MoE to scale effectively without a corresponding increase in inference costs. Time-MoE comprises a family of decoder-only transformer models that operate in an auto-regressive manner and support flexible forecasting horizons with varying input context lengths. We pre-trained these models on our newly introduced large-scale data Time-300B, which spans over 9 domains and encompassing over 300 billion time points. For the first time, we scaled a time series foundation model up to 2.4 billion parameters, achieving significantly improved forecasting precision. Our results validate the applicability of scaling laws for training tokens and model size in the context of time series forecasting. Compared to dense models with the same number of activated parameters or equivalent computation budgets, our models consistently outperform them by large margin. These advancements position Time-MoE as a state-of-the-art solution for tackling real-world time series forecasting challenges with superior capability, efficiency, and flexibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Tell me why: Visual foundation models as self-explainable classifiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19577v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual foundation models (VFMs) have become increasingly popular due to their state-of-the-art performance. However, interpretability remains crucial for critical applications. In this sense, self-explainable models (SEM) aim to provide interpretable classifiers that decompose predictions into a weighted sum of interpretable concepts. Despite their promise, recent studies have shown that these explanations often lack faithfulness. In this work, we combine VFMs with a novel prototypical architecture and specialized training objectives. By training only a lightweight head (approximately 1M parameters) on top of frozen VFMs, our approach (ProtoFM) offers an efficient and interpretable solution. Evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive classification performance while outperforming existing models across a range of interpretability metrics derived from the literature.

To handle loops we rely on user-provided quantitative invariants, as is well established. However, in the realm of continuous distributions, invariant verification becomes extremely challenging due to the presence of integrals in expectation-based program semantics. Our key idea is to soundly under- or over-approximate these integrals via Riemann sums. We show that this approach enables the SMT-based invariant verification for programs with a fairly general control flow structure. On the theoretical side, we prove convergence of our Riemann approximations, and establish coRE-completeness of the central verification problems. On the practical side, we show that our approach enables to use existing automated verifiers targeting discrete probabilistic programs for the verification of programs involving continuous sampling. Towards this end, we implement our approach in the recent quantitative verification infrastructure Caesar by encoding Riemann sums in its intermediate verification language. We present several promising case studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of OOPSLA 25 paper, 55 pages</p></details> |

Here, we developed CT-FM, a large-scale 3D image-based pre-trained model designed explicitly for various radiological tasks. CT-FM was pre-trained using 148,000 computed tomography (CT) scans from the Imaging Data Commons through label-agnostic contrastive learning. We evaluated CT-FM across four categories of tasks, namely, whole-body and tumor segmentation, head CT triage, medical image retrieval, and semantic understanding, showing superior performance against state-of-the-art models. Beyond quantitative success, CT-FM demonstrated the ability to cluster regions anatomically and identify similar anatomical and structural concepts across scans. Furthermore, it remained robust across test-retest settings and indicated reasonable salient regions attached to its embeddings. This study demonstrates the value of large-scale medical imaging foundation models and by open-sourcing the model weights, code, and data, aims to support more adaptable, reliable, and interpretable AI solutions in radiology.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 fig...</summary><p>6 figures, followed by 9 Extended Data Figures and a Supplementary Information document</p></details> |

We also show additional capabilities such as precise instruction-based video editing and generation of personalized videos based on a user's image. Our models set a new state-of-the-art on multiple tasks: text-to-video synthesis, video personalization, video editing, video-to-audio generation, and text-to-audio generation. Our largest video generation model is a 30B parameter transformer trained with a maximum context length of 73K video tokens, corresponding to a generated video of 16 seconds at 16 frames-per-second. We show multiple technical innovations and simplifications on the architecture, latent spaces, training objectives and recipes, data curation, evaluation protocols, parallelization techniques, and inference optimizations that allow us to reap the benefits of scaling pre-training data, model size, and training compute for training large scale media generation models.

| **[EndoMamba: An Efficient Foundation Model for Endoscopic Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19090v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Endoscopic video-based tasks, such as visual navigation and surgical phase recognition, play a crucial role in minimally invasive surgeries by providing real-time assistance. While recent video foundation models have shown promise, their applications are hindered by (1) computational inefficiencies and (2) suboptimal performance caused by limited data for pre-training in endoscopy. To address these issues, we present EndoMamba, a foundation model designed for real-time inference while learning generalized spatiotemporal representations. First, to mitigate computational inefficiencies, we propose the EndoMamba backbone, optimized for real-time inference. Inspired by recent advancements in state space models, EndoMamba integrates Bidirectional Mamba blocks for spatial modeling within individual frames and vanilla Mamba blocks for past-to-present reasoning across the temporal domain. This design enables both strong spatiotemporal modeling and efficient inference in online video streams. Second, we propose a self-supervised hierarchical pre-training diagram to enhance EndoMamba's representation learning using endoscopic videos and incorporating general video domain knowledge. Specifically, our approach combines masked reconstruction with auxiliary supervision, leveraging low-level reconstruction to capture spatial-temporal structures and high-level alignment to transfer broader knowledge from a pretrained general-video domain foundation model. Extensive experiments on four downstream tasks--classification, segmentation, surgical phase recognition, and localization--demonstrate that EndoMamba outperforms existing foundation models and task-specific methods while maintaining real-time inference speed. The source code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation Inference Models for Stochastic Differential Equations: A Transformer-based Approach for Zero-shot Function Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19049v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) describe dynamical systems where deterministic flows, governed by a drift function, are superimposed with random fluctuations dictated by a diffusion function. The accurate estimation (or discovery) of these functions from data is a central problem in machine learning, with wide application across natural and social sciences alike. Yet current solutions are brittle, and typically rely on symbolic regression or Bayesian non-parametrics. In this work, we introduce FIM-SDE (Foundation Inference Model for SDEs), a transformer-based recognition model capable of performing accurate zero-shot estimation of the drift and diffusion functions of SDEs, from noisy and sparse observations on empirical processes of different dimensionalities. Leveraging concepts from amortized inference and neural operators, we train FIM-SDE in a supervised fashion, to map a large set of noisy and discretely observed SDE paths to their corresponding drift and diffusion functions. We demonstrate that one and the same (pretrained) FIM-SDE achieves robust zero-shot function estimation (i.e. without any parameter fine-tuning) across a wide range of synthetic and real-world processes, from canonical SDE systems (e.g. double-well dynamics or weakly perturbed Hopf bifurcations) to human motion recordings and oil price and wind speed fluctuations.</p></details> |  |

The existing video foundational model, InternVideo2, has demonstrated strong potential in video understanding tasks due to its large parameter size and large-scale multimodal data pertaining. Building on this, we explored the transferability of InternVideo2 to video quality assessment under compression scenarios. To design a lightweight model suitable for this task, we proposed a distillation method to equip the smaller model with rich compression quality priors. Additionally, we examined the performance of different backbones during the distillation process. The results showed that, compared to other methods, our lightweight model distilled from InternVideo2 achieved excellent performance in compression video quality assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ISCAS 2025(Lecture)</p></details> |

These models, categorized into uni-modal and multi-modal frameworks, have demonstrated promise in automating complex pathology tasks such as segmentation, classification, and biomarker discovery. However, the development of CPathFMs presents significant challenges, such as limited data accessibility, high variability across datasets, the necessity for domain-specific adaptation, and the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. This survey provides a comprehensive review of CPathFMs in computational pathology, focusing on datasets, adaptation strategies, and evaluation tasks. We analyze key techniques, such as contrastive learning and multi-modal integration, and highlight existing gaps in current research. Finally, we explore future directions from four perspectives for advancing CPathFMs. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers, clinicians, and AI practitioners, guiding the advancement of CPathFMs toward robust and clinically applicable AI-driven pathology solutions.</p></details> |  |

However, applying LLMs to the communication domain faces three major challenges: 1) Inadequate communication data; 2) Restricted input modalities; and 3) Difficulty in knowledge retrieval. To overcome these issues, we propose CommGPT, a multimodal foundation model designed specifically for communications. First, we create high-quality pretraining and fine-tuning datasets tailored in communication, enabling the LLM to engage in further pretraining and fine-tuning with communication concepts and knowledge. Then, we design a multimodal encoder to understand and process information from various input modalities. Next, we construct a Graph and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GRG) framework, efficiently coupling Knowledge Graph (KG) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for multi-scale learning. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the CommGPT through experimental validation.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Generalizability of Foundation Models for Crop Type Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09451v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pre-trained using self-supervised learning have shown powerful transfer learning capabilities on various downstream tasks, including language understanding, text generation, and image recognition. The Earth observation (EO) field has produced several foundation models pre-trained directly on multispectral satellite imagery for applications like precision agriculture, wildfire and drought monitoring, and natural disaster response. However, few studies have investigated the ability of these models to generalize to new geographic locations, and potential concerns of geospatial bias -- models trained on data-rich developed nations not transferring well to data-scarce developing nations -- remain. We investigate the ability of popular EO foundation models to transfer to new geographic regions in the agricultural domain, where differences in farming practices and class imbalance make transfer learning particularly challenging. We first select five crop classification datasets across five continents, normalizing for dataset size and harmonizing classes to focus on four major cereal grains: maize, soybean, rice, and wheat. We then compare three popular foundation models, pre-trained on SSL4EO-S12, SatlasPretrain, and ImageNet, using in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluation. Experiments show that pre-trained weights designed explicitly for Sentinel-2, such as SSL4EO-S12, outperform general pre-trained weights like ImageNet. Furthermore, while only 100 labeled images are sufficient for achieving high overall accuracy, 900 images are required to achieve high average accuracy due to class imbalance. All harmonized datasets and experimental code are open-source and available for download.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we investigate the Post-Soviet cultural food knowledge of foundation models by constructing BORSch, a multimodal dataset encompassing 1147 and 823 dishes in the Russian and Ukrainian languages, centered around the Post-Soviet region. We demonstrate that leading models struggle to correctly identify the origins of dishes from Post-Soviet nations in both text-only and multimodal Question Answering (QA), instead over-predicting countries linked to the language the question is asked in. Through analysis of pretraining data, we show that these results can be explained by misleading dish-origin co-occurrences, along with linguistic phenomena such as Russian-Ukrainian code mixing. Finally, to move beyond QA-based assessments, we test models' abilities to produce accurate visual descriptions of dishes. The weak correlation between this task and QA suggests that QA alone may be insufficient as an evaluation of cultural understanding. To foster further research, we will make BORSch publicly available at https://github.com/alavrouk/BORSch.</p></details> |  |

However, the resulting trade-offs degrade image quality, limiting clinical acceptability. Although deep learning methods have been used to enhance NICT images, their reliance on large training datasets and limited generalizability across diverse settings hinder practical use. We propose the multi-scale integrated Transformer AMPlifier (TAMP), the first imaging foundation model for universal NICT enhancement. Pre-trained on 10.8 million physics-driven simulated NICT images, TAMP generalizes effectively across various NICT settings, defect degrees, and body regions. Moreover, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy enables TAMP to adapt to specific clinical scenarios using only few slices. Extensive experiments, including radiologists and real-world validations, demonstrate that TAMP consistently improves image quality and clinical acceptability, underscoring its significant potential to advance CT imaging and broaden NICT applications in clinical practice.</p></details> |  |

To facilitate large-scale training, MotionBook, a comprehensive human motion dictionary of discretized motions is designed and employed. MotionBook utilizes Thermal Cubes to capture spatio-temporal motion heatmaps, applying principles from discrete variational models to encode human movements into discrete units for a more efficient and scalable representation. MoFM, trained on a large corpus of motion data, provides a foundational backbone adaptable to diverse downstream tasks, supporting paradigms such as one-shot, unsupervised, and supervised tasks. This versatility makes MoFM well-suited for a wide range of motion-based applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[PromptMID: Modal Invariant Descriptors Based on Diffusion and Vision Foundation Models for Optical-SAR Image Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18104v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ideal goal of image matching is to achieve stable and efficient performance in unseen domains. However, many existing learning-based optical-SAR image matching methods, despite their effectiveness in specific scenarios, exhibit limited generalization and struggle to adapt to practical applications. Repeatedly training or fine-tuning matching models to address domain differences is not only not elegant enough but also introduces additional computational overhead and data production costs. In recent years, general foundation models have shown great potential for enhancing generalization. However, the disparity in visual domains between natural and remote sensing images poses challenges for their direct application. Therefore, effectively leveraging foundation models to improve the generalization of optical-SAR image matching remains challenge. To address the above challenges, we propose PromptMID, a novel approach that constructs modality-invariant descriptors using text prompts based on land use classification as priors information for optical and SAR image matching. PromptMID extracts multi-scale modality-invariant features by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models and visual foundation models (VFMs), while specially designed feature aggregation modules effectively fuse features across different granularities. Extensive experiments on optical-SAR image datasets from four diverse regions demonstrate that PromptMID outperforms state-of-the-art matching methods, achieving superior results in both seen and unseen domains and exhibiting strong cross-domain generalization capabilities. The source code will be made publicly available https://github.com/HanNieWHU/PromptMID.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |

However, we posit that the very same strength can make applications based on FMs vulnerable to model stealing attacks. Through empirical analysis, we reveal that models fine-tuned from FMs harbor heightened susceptibility to model stealing, compared to conventional vision architectures like ResNets. We hypothesize that this behavior is due to the comprehensive encoding of visual patterns and features learned by FMs during pre-training, which are accessible to both the attacker and the victim. We report that an attacker is able to obtain 94.28% agreement (matched predictions with victim) for a Vision Transformer based victim model (ViT-L/16) trained on CIFAR-10 dataset, compared to only 73.20% agreement for a ResNet-18 victim, when using ViT-L/16 as the thief model. We arguably show, for the first time, that utilizing FMs for downstream tasks may not be the best choice for deployment in commercial APIs due to their susceptibility to model theft. We thereby alert model owners towards the associated security risks, and highlight the need for robust security measures to safeguard such models against theft.

| **[Revisiting Convolution Architecture in the Realm of DNA Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18538v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, a variety of methods based on Transformer and state space model (SSM) architectures have been proposed, advancing foundational DNA language models. However, there is a lack of comparison between these recent approaches and the classical architecture convolutional networks (CNNs) on foundation model benchmarks. This raises the question: are CNNs truly being surpassed by these recent approaches based on transformer and SSM architectures? In this paper, we develop a simple but well-designed CNN-based method termed ConvNova. ConvNova identifies and proposes three effective designs: 1) dilated convolutions, 2) gated convolutions, and 3) a dual-branch framework for gating mechanisms. Through extensive empirical experiments, we demonstrate that ConvNova significantly outperforms recent methods on more than half of the tasks across several foundation model benchmarks. For example, in histone-related tasks, ConvNova exceeds the second-best method by an average of 5.8%, while generally utilizing fewer parameters and enabling faster computation. In addition, the experiments observed findings that may be related to biological characteristics. This indicates that CNNs are still a strong competitor compared to Transformers and SSMs. We anticipate that this work will spark renewed interest in CNN-based methods for DNA foundation models.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the limited real-world data and unbearable consequences of taking detrimental actions, the learning of RL policy is mainly restricted within the simulators. This practice guarantees safety in learning but introduces an inevitable sim-to-real gap in terms of deployment, thus causing degraded performance and risks in execution. There are attempts to solve the sim-to-real problems from different domains with various techniques, especially in the era with emerging techniques such as large foundations or language models that have cast light on the sim-to-real. This survey paper, to the best of our knowledge, is the first taxonomy that formally frames the sim-to-real techniques from key elements of the Markov Decision Process (State, Action, Transition, and Reward). Based on the framework, we cover comprehensive literature from the classic to the most advanced methods including the sim-to-real techniques empowered by foundation models, and we also discuss the specialties that are worth attention in different domains of sim-to-real problems.

However, SSL strategies must be adapted to the type of training data and downstream tasks required. We propose RS3L ("Re-simulation-based self-supervised representation learning"), a novel simulation-based SSL strategy that employs a method of re-simulation to drive data augmentation for contrastive learning in the physical sciences, particularly, in fields that rely on stochastic simulators. By intervening in the middle of the simulation process and re-running simulation components downstream of the intervention, we generate multiple realizations of an event, thus producing a set of augmentations covering all physics-driven variations available in the simulator. Using experiments from high-energy physics, we explore how this strategy may enable the development of a foundation model; we show how RS3L pre-training enables powerful performance in downstream tasks such as discrimination of a variety of objects and uncertainty mitigation. In addition to our results, we make the RS3L dataset publicly available for further studies on how to improve SSL strategies.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

Understanding and mitigating negative effects requires parsing data on forests at global scale from a broad array of sensory modalities, and using them in diverse forest monitoring applications. Such diversity in data and applications can be effectively addressed through the development of a large, pre-trained foundation model that serves as a versatile base for various downstream tasks. However, remote sensing modalities, which are an excellent fit for several forest management tasks, are particularly challenging considering the variation in environmental conditions, object scales, image acquisition modes, spatio-temporal resolutions, etc. With that in mind, we present the first unified Forest Monitoring Benchmark (FoMo-Bench), carefully constructed to evaluate foundation models with such flexibility. FoMo-Bench consists of 15 diverse datasets encompassing satellite, aerial, and inventory data, covering a variety of geographical regions, and including multispectral, red-green-blue, synthetic aperture radar and LiDAR data with various temporal, spatial and spectral resolutions. FoMo-Bench includes multiple types of forest-monitoring tasks, spanning classification, segmentation, and object detection. To enhance task and geographic diversity in FoMo-Bench, we introduce TalloS, a global dataset combining satellite imagery with ground-based annotations for tree species classification across 1,000+ categories and hierarchical taxonomic levels. Finally, we propose FoMo-Net, a pre-training framework to develop foundation models with the capacity to process any combination of commonly used modalities and spectral bands in remote sensing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AI for Social Impact track</p></details> |

However, current TAG approaches face two primary challenges: (i) Heavy reliance on label information and (ii) Limited cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability. These issues constrain the scaling of both data and model size, owing to high labor costs and scaling laws, complicating the development of graph foundation models with strong transferability. In this work, we propose the GraphCLIP framework to address these challenges by learning graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability through a self-supervised contrastive graph-summary pretraining method. Specifically, we generate and curate large-scale graph-summary pair data with the assistance of LLMs, and introduce a novel graph-summary pretraining method, combined with invariant learning, to enhance graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero-shot transferability. For few-shot learning, we propose a novel graph prompt tuning technique aligned with our pretraining objective to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and minimize learning costs. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GraphCLIP in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, while evaluations across various downstream tasks confirm the versatility of GraphCLIP.

Recent progress in crystal generation models, which design crystal structures for targeted properties, and foundation atomic models (FAMs), which capture interatomic interactions across the periodic table, has significantly improved inverse materials design. However, an efficient integration of these two approaches remains an open challenge. Here, we present an active learning framework that combines crystal generation models and foundation atomic models to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of inverse design. As a case study, we employ Con-CDVAE to generate candidate crystal structures and MACE-MP-0 FAM as one of the high-throughput screeners for bulk modulus evaluation. Through iterative active learning, we demonstrate that Con-CDVAE progressively improves its accuracy in generating crystals with target properties, highlighting the effectiveness of a property-driven fine-tuning process. Our framework is general to accommodate different crystal generation and foundation atomic models, and establishes a scalable approach for AI-driven materials discovery. By bridging generative modeling with atomic-scale simulations, this work paves the way for more accurate and efficient inverse materials design.</p></details> |  |

PFMs have simplified the development of deep learning models, effectively leveraging prior knowledge to improve diagnostic accuracy in diverse scenarios. However, we find that PFMs sometimes struggle with certain challenges. Specifically, features extracted by PFMs are often contaminated by diagnosis-irrelevant information, i.e., institution-specific features associated with the images. This contamination can lead to spurious correlations, undermining the models' generalization ability when applied in real-world clinical settings. In this work, we first reveal the issue of feature contamination in PFMs, demonstrate the presence of institution-specific features, thoroughly investigate its negative impacts, analyze the underlying causes, and provide insights into potential solutions. Specifically, we find that institution-specific information is embedded in pathological images and can be readily captured by current PFMs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the detrimental impact of this irrelevant information, particularly in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, where reliance on contaminated features leads to significant performance degradation. This indicates that the models are being misled by non-diagnostic information. We further delve into the reasons PFMs extract such institution-specific information and validate our findings. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective solution to mitigate the influence of irrelevant information. This study is not intended to criticize existing PFMs, as they have indeed greatly advanced the development of computational pathology. our aim is to inspire future research to focus on innovative training strategies, rather than relying exclusively on scaling laws, to realize more generalized PFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages,1 figure,14 tables</p></details> |

Existing foundation models are primarily trained on English, limiting their effectiveness for India's population. Indic languages comprise only 1 percent of Common Crawl corpora despite India representing 18 percent of the global population, leading to linguistic biases. Thousands of regional languages, dialects, and code mixing create additional representation challenges due to sparse training data. We introduce Krutrim LLM, a 2 trillion token multilingual model designed for India's linguistic landscape. It incorporates the largest known Indic dataset, mitigating data scarcity and ensuring balanced performance across dialects. Krutrim outperforms or matches state-of-the-art models on Indic benchmarks while maintaining competitive English performance. Despite being significantly smaller in training flops, Krutrim LLM matches or exceeds models like LLAMA-2 on 10 out of 16 tasks, with an average score of 0.57 versus 0.55. This evidences Krutrim's flexible multilingual fluency across diverse linguistic contexts. Krutrim is integrated with real-time search to improve factual accuracy in conversational AI applications. This enhances accessibility for over 1 billion users worldwide. Through intentional design choices addressing data imbalances, Krutrim LLM signifies meaningful progress in building ethical, globally representative AI models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fair Foundation Models for Medical Image Analysis: Challenges and Perspectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16841v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring equitable Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare demands systems that make unbiased decisions across all demographic groups, bridging technical innovation with ethical principles. Foundation Models (FMs), trained on vast datasets through self-supervised learning, enable efficient adaptation across medical imaging tasks while reducing dependency on labeled data. These models demonstrate potential for enhancing fairness, though significant challenges remain in achieving consistent performance across demographic groups. Our review indicates that effective bias mitigation in FMs requires systematic interventions throughout all stages of development. While previous approaches focused primarily on model-level bias mitigation, our analysis reveals that fairness in FMs requires integrated interventions throughout the development pipeline, from data documentation to deployment protocols. This comprehensive framework advances current knowledge by demonstrating how systematic bias mitigation, combined with policy engagement, can effectively address both technical and institutional barriers to equitable AI in healthcare. The development of equitable FMs represents a critical step toward democratizing advanced healthcare technologies, particularly for underserved populations and regions with limited medical infrastructure and computational resources.</p></details> |  |

However, current works in artificial social reasoning all rely on language-only, or language-dominant approaches to benchmark and training models, resulting in systems that are improving in verbal communication but struggle with nonverbal social understanding. To address this limitation, we tap into a novel source of data rich in nonverbal and social interactions -- mime videos. Mimes refer to the art of expression through gesture and movement without spoken words, which presents unique challenges and opportunities in interpreting non-verbal social communication. We contribute a new dataset called MimeQA, obtained by sourcing 221 videos from YouTube, through rigorous annotation and verification, resulting in a benchmark with 101 videos and 806 question-answer pairs. Using MimeQA, we evaluate state-of-the-art video large language models (vLLMs) and find that their overall accuracy ranges from 15-30%. Our analysis reveals that vLLMs often fail to ground imagined objects and over-rely on the text prompt while ignoring subtle nonverbal interactions. Our data resources are released at https://github.com/MIT-MI/MimeQA to inspire future work in foundation models that embody true social intelligence capable of interpreting non-verbal human interactions.</p></details> |  |

In our previous work, we propose a novel method to realize seamless adaptation of foundation models to VPR (SelaVPR). This method can produce both global and local features that focus on discriminative landmarks to recognize places for two-stage VPR by a parameter-efficient adaptation approach. Although SelaVPR has achieved competitive results, we argue that the previous adaptation is inefficient in training time and GPU memory usage, and the re-ranking paradigm is also costly in retrieval latency and storage usage. In pursuit of higher efficiency and better performance, we propose an extension of the SelaVPR, called SelaVPR++. Concretely, we first design a parameter-, time-, and memory-efficient adaptation method that uses lightweight multi-scale convolution (MultiConv) adapters to refine intermediate features from the frozen foundation backbone. This adaptation method does not back-propagate gradients through the backbone during training, and the MultiConv adapter facilitates feature interactions along the spatial axes and introduces proper local priors, thus achieving higher efficiency and better performance. Moreover, we propose an innovative re-ranking paradigm for more efficient VPR. Instead of relying on local features for re-ranking, which incurs huge overhead in latency and storage, we employ compact binary features for initial retrieval and robust floating-point (global) features for re-ranking. To obtain such binary features, we propose a similarity-constrained deep hashing method, which can be easily integrated into the VPR pipeline. Finally, we improve our training strategy and unify the training protocol of several common training datasets to merge them for better training of VPR models. Extensive experiments show that ......</p></details> |  |
| **[Triad: Vision Foundation Model for 3D Magnetic Resonance Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14064v2)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models (VFMs) are pre-trained on extensive image datasets to learn general representations for diverse types of data. These models can subsequently be fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks, significantly boosting performance across a broad range of applications. However, existing vision foundation models that claim to be applicable to various clinical tasks are mostly pre-trained on 3D computed tomography (CT), which benefits from the availability of extensive 3D CT databases. Significant differences between CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in imaging principles, signal characteristics, and data distribution may hinder their practical performance and versatility in MRI-specific applications. Here, we propose Triad, a vision foundation model for 3D MRI. Triad adopts a widely used autoencoder architecture to learn robust representations from 131,170 3D MRI volumes and uses organ-independent imaging descriptions to constrain the semantic distribution of the visual modality. The above pre-training dataset is called Triad-131K, which is currently the largest 3D MRI pre-training dataset. We evaluate Triad across three tasks, namely, organ/tumor segmentation, organ/cancer classification, and medical image registration, in two data modalities (within-domain and out-of-domain) settings using 25 downstream datasets. By initializing models with Triad's pre-trained weights, nnUNet-Triad improves segmentation performance by 2.51% compared to nnUNet-Scratch across 17 datasets. Swin-B-Triad achieves a 3.97% improvement over Swin-B-Scratch in classification tasks across five datasets. SwinUNETR-Triad improves by 4.00% compared to SwinUNETR-Scratch in registration tasks across two datasets. Our study demonstrates that pre-training can improve performance when the data modalities and organs of upstream and downstream tasks are consistent.</p></details> |  |

While significant progress has been made in interpreting Large Language Models (LLMs), multimodal foundation models (MMFMs) - such as contrastive vision-language models, generative vision-language models, and text-to-image models - pose unique interpretability challenges beyond unimodal frameworks. Despite initial studies, a substantial gap remains between the interpretability of LLMs and MMFMs. This survey explores two key aspects: (1) the adaptation of LLM interpretability methods to multimodal models and (2) understanding the mechanistic differences between unimodal language models and crossmodal systems. By systematically reviewing current MMFM analysis techniques, we propose a structured taxonomy of interpretability methods, compare insights across unimodal and multimodal architectures, and highlight critical research gaps.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 4 Figures, 10 Tables</p></details> |

Nevertheless, these models often struggle with non-verbal audio data, such as vocalizations, baby crying, etc., which are critical for various real-world applications. Audio foundation models well handle non-speech data but also fail to capture the nuanced features of non-verbal human sounds. In this work, we aim to overcome the above shortcoming and propose a novel foundation model, termed voc2vec, specifically designed for non-verbal human data leveraging exclusively open-source non-verbal audio datasets. We employ a collection of 10 datasets covering around 125 hours of non-verbal audio. Experimental results prove that voc2vec is effective in non-verbal vocalization classification, and it outperforms conventional speech and audio foundation models. Moreover, voc2vec consistently outperforms strong baselines, namely OpenSmile and emotion2vec, on six different benchmark datasets. To the best of the authors' knowledge, voc2vec is the first universal representation model for vocalization tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

Early EEG decoding methods rely on supervised learning, limited by specific tasks and datasets, hindering model performance and generalizability. With the success of large language models, there is a growing body of studies focusing on EEG foundation models. However, these studies still leave challenges: Firstly, most of existing EEG foundation models employ full EEG modeling strategy. It models the spatial and temporal dependencies between all EEG patches together, but ignores that the spatial and temporal dependencies are heterogeneous due to the unique structural characteristics of EEG signals. Secondly, existing EEG foundation models have limited generalizability on a wide range of downstream BCI tasks due to varying formats of EEG data, making it challenging to adapt to. To address these challenges, we propose a novel foundation model called CBraMod. Specifically, we devise a criss-cross transformer as the backbone to thoroughly leverage the structural characteristics of EEG signals, which can model spatial and temporal dependencies separately through two parallel attention mechanisms. And we utilize an asymmetric conditional positional encoding scheme which can encode positional information of EEG patches and be easily adapted to the EEG with diverse formats. CBraMod is pre-trained on a very large corpus of EEG through patch-based masked EEG reconstruction. We evaluate CBraMod on up to 10 downstream BCI tasks (12 public datasets). CBraMod achieves the state-of-the-art performance across the wide range of tasks, proving its strong capability and generalizability.

However, the scarcity of labeled EEG data poses a significant challenge. Foundation models offer a promising solution by leveraging large-scale unlabeled data through pre-training, enabling strong performance across diverse tasks. While both temporal dynamics and inter-channel relationships are vital for understanding EEG signals, existing EEG foundation models primarily focus on the former, overlooking the latter. To address this limitation, we propose Graph-Enhanced EEG Foundation Model (GEFM), a novel foundation model for EEG that integrates both temporal and inter-channel information. Our architecture combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which effectively capture relational structures, with a masked autoencoder to enable efficient pre-training. We evaluated our approach using three downstream tasks and experimented with various GNN architectures. The results demonstrate that our proposed model, particularly when employing the GCN architecture with optimized configurations, consistently outperformed baseline methods across all tasks. These findings suggest that our model serves as a robust foundation model for EEG analysis.</p></details> |  |

Yet the data silo challenge and privacy concern remain in healthcare systems, hindering safe medical data sharing and collaborative model development among institutions. The collection and curation of scalable clinical datasets increasingly become the bottleneck for training strong FMs. In this study, we propose Medical Foundation Models Merging (MedForge), a cooperative framework enabling a community-driven medical foundation model development, meanwhile preventing the information leakage of raw patient data and mitigating synchronization model development issues across clinical institutions. MedForge offers a bottom-up model construction mechanism by flexibly merging task-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules, which can adapt to downstream tasks while retaining original model parameters. Through an asynchronous LoRA module integration scheme, the resulting composite model can progressively enhance its comprehensive performance on various clinical tasks. MedForge shows strong performance on multiple clinical datasets (e.g., breast cancer, lung cancer, and colon cancer) collected from different institutions. Our major findings highlight the value of collaborative foundation models in advancing multi-center clinical collaboration effectively and cohesively.

Existing methods primarily focus on constraining and projecting current model towards the pre-trained initialization based on the magnitudes between fine-tuned and pre-trained weights, which often require extensive hyper-parameter tuning and can sometimes result in underfitting. In this work, we propose Directional Gradient Projection (DiGraP), a novel layer-wise trainable method that incorporates directional information from gradients to bridge regularization and multi-objective optimization. Besides demonstrating our method on image classification, as another contribution we generalize this area to the multi-modal evaluation settings for robust fine-tuning. Specifically, we first bridge the uni-modal and multi-modal gap by performing analysis on Image Classification reformulated Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks and further categorize ten out-of-distribution (OOD) VQA datasets by distribution shift types and degree (i.e. near versus far OOD). Experimental results show that DiGraP consistently outperforms existing baselines across Image Classfication and VQA tasks with discriminative and generative backbones, improving both in-distribution (ID) generalization and OOD robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Current deep learning approaches for MILP focus on specific problem classes and do not generalize to unseen classes. To address this shortcoming, we take a foundation model training approach, where we train a single deep learning model on a diverse set of MILP problems to generalize across problem classes. As existing datasets for MILP lack diversity and volume, we introduce MILP-Evolve, a novel LLM-based evolutionary framework that is capable of generating a large set of diverse MILP classes with an unlimited amount of instances. We study our methodology on three key learning tasks that capture diverse aspects of MILP: (1) integrality gap prediction, (2) learning to branch, and (3) a new task of aligning MILP instances with natural language descriptions. Our empirical results show that models trained on the data generated by MILP-Evolve achieve significant improvements on unseen problems, including MIPLIB benchmarks. Our work highlights the potential of moving towards a foundation model approach for MILP that can generalize to a broad range of MILP applications.

However, challenges such as data scarcity and data imbalance continue to hinder their development. To address this, we consider modeling complex systems through symbolic expressions that serve as semantic descriptors of time series.

Leveraging the S2 dataset, we develop SymTime, a pre-trained foundation model for TSA. SymTime demonstrates competitive performance across five major TSA tasks when fine-tuned with downstream task, rivaling foundation models pre-trained on real-world datasets. This approach underscores the potential of dual-modality data generation and pretraining mechanisms in overcoming data scarcity and enhancing task performance.</p></details> |  |

Despite progress, fetal ultrasound images remain a challenging domain for foundation models due to their inherent complexity, often requiring substantial additional training and facing limitations due to the scarcity of paired multimodal data. To overcome these challenges, here we introduce FetalCLIP, a vision-language foundation model capable of generating universal representation of fetal ultrasound images. FetalCLIP was pre-trained using a multimodal learning approach on a diverse dataset of 210,035 fetal ultrasound images paired with text. This represents the largest paired dataset of its kind used for foundation model development to date. This unique training approach allows FetalCLIP to effectively learn the intricate anatomical features present in fetal ultrasound images, resulting in robust representations that can be used for a variety of downstream applications. In extensive benchmarking across a range of key fetal ultrasound applications, including classification, gestational age estimation, congenital heart defect (CHD) detection, and fetal structure segmentation, FetalCLIP outperformed all baselines while demonstrating remarkable generalizability and strong performance even with limited labeled data. We plan to release the FetalCLIP model publicly for the benefit of the broader scientific community.</p></details> |  |

An Analysis of Cross-Lingual and Cross-Modal Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17666v2)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal foundation models aim to create a unified representation space that abstracts away from surface features like language syntax or modality differences. To investigate this, we study the internal representations of three recent models, analyzing the model activations from semantically equivalent sentences across languages in the text and speech modalities. Our findings reveal that: 1) Cross-modal representations converge over model layers, except in the initial layers specialized at text and speech processing. 2) Length adaptation is crucial for reducing the cross-modal gap between text and speech, although current approaches' effectiveness is primarily limited to high-resource languages. 3) Speech exhibits larger cross-lingual differences than text. 4) For models not explicitly trained for modality-agnostic representations, the modality gap is more prominent than the language gap.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 |

However, existing user targeting methods encounter two significant challenges: (i) Poor cross-domain and cross-scenario transferability and generalization, and (ii) Insufficient forecastability in real-world applications. These limitations hinder their applicability across diverse industrial scenarios. In this work, we propose FOUND, an industrial-grade, transferable, and forecastable user targeting foundation model. To enhance cross-domain transferability, our framework integrates heterogeneous multi-scenario user data, aligning them with one-sentence targeting demand inputs through contrastive pre-training. For improved forecastability, the text description of each user is derived based on anticipated future behaviors, while user representations are constructed from historical information. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing baselines in cross-domain, real-world user targeting scenarios, showcasing the superior capabilities of FOUND. Moreover, our method has been successfully deployed on the Alipay platform and is widely utilized across various scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, accept by The ACM Web Conference 2025 (WWW 2025) Industry Track</p></details> |
| **[Bridging Smart Meter Gaps: A Benchmark of Statistical, Machine Learning and Time Series Foundation Models for Data Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07276v2)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integrity of time series data in smart grids is often compromised by missing values due to sensor failures, transmission errors, or disruptions. Gaps in smart meter data can bias consumption analyses and hinder reliable predictions, causing technical and economic inefficiencies. As smart meter data grows in volume and complexity, conventional techniques struggle with its nonlinear and nonstationary patterns. In this context, Generative Artificial Intelligence offers promising solutions that may outperform traditional statistical methods. In this paper, we evaluate two general-purpose Large Language Models and five Time Series Foundation Models for smart meter data imputation, comparing them with conventional Machine Learning and statistical models. We introduce artificial gaps (30 minutes to one day) into an anonymized public dataset to test inference capabilities. Results show that Time Series Foundation Models, with their contextual understanding and pattern recognition, could significantly enhance imputation accuracy in certain cases. However, the trade-off between computational cost and performance gains remains a critical consideration.</p></details> |  |

However, their widespread adoption raises critical concerns regarding trustworthiness across dimensions. This paper presents a comprehensive framework to address these challenges through three key contributions. First, we systematically review global AI governance laws and policies from governments and regulatory bodies, as well as industry practices and standards. Based on this analysis, we propose a set of guiding principles for GenFMs, developed through extensive multidisciplinary collaboration that integrates technical, ethical, legal, and societal perspectives. Second, we introduce TrustGen, the first dynamic benchmarking platform designed to evaluate trustworthiness across multiple dimensions and model types, including text-to-image, large language, and vision-language models. TrustGen leverages modular components--metadata curation, test case generation, and contextual variation--to enable adaptive and iterative assessments, overcoming the limitations of static evaluation methods. Using TrustGen, we reveal significant progress in trustworthiness while identifying persistent challenges. Finally, we provide an in-depth discussion of the challenges and future directions for trustworthy GenFMs, which reveals the complex, evolving nature of trustworthiness, highlighting the nuanced trade-offs between utility and trustworthiness, and consideration for various downstream applications, identifying persistent challenges and providing a strategic roadmap for future research. This work establishes a holistic framework for advancing trustworthiness in GenAI, paving the way for safer and more responsible integration of GenFMs into critical applications. To facilitate advancement in the community, we release the toolkit for dynamic evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Stronger Mixture of Low-Rank Experts for Fine-Tuning Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15828v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In order to streamline the fine-tuning of foundation models, Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) have been substantially adopted across various fields, including instruction tuning and domain adaptation. The underlying concept of LoRA involves decomposing a full-rank matrix into the product of two lower-rank matrices, which reduces storage consumption and accelerates the training process. Furthermore, to address the limited expressive capacity of LoRA, the Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) has been introduced for incorporating multiple LoRA adapters. The integration of LoRA experts leads to a visible improvement across several downstream scenes. However, the mixture of LoRAs (MoE-LoRA) still exhibits its low robustness during tuning and inferring. Inspired by the Riemannian Preconditioners which train LoRA as a sub-space projector, we propose a new training strategy for MoE-LoRA, to stabilize and boost its feature learning procedure by multi-space projections. Examinations on SGD and AdamW optimizers demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology. Source code is available at https://github.com/THUDM/MoELoRA_Riemannian.</p></details> |  |

These embeddings optimise general performance, and if insufficiently accurate at a specific task the model can be fine-tuned to improve performance. For all current methodologies this operation necessarily degrades performance on all out-of-distribution tasks. In this work we present 'fill-tuning', a novel methodology to generate datasets for continued pretraining of foundation models that are not suited to a particular downstream task, but instead aim to correct poor regions of the embedding. We present the application of roughness analysis to latent space topologies and illustrate how it can be used to propose data that will be most valuable to improving the embedding. We apply fill-tuning to a set of state-of-the-art materials foundation models trained on $O(10^9)$ data points and show model improvement of almost 1% in all downstream tasks with the addition of only 100 data points. This method provides a route to the general improvement of foundation models at the computational cost of fine-tuning.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

The coding sequence as well as the Untranslated Regions (UTRs) of an mRNA can strongly influence translation efficiency, stability, degradation, and other factors that collectively determine a vaccine's effectiveness. However, optimizing mRNA sequences for those properties remains a complex challenge. Existing deep learning models often focus solely on coding region optimization, overlooking the UTRs. We present Helix-mRNA, a structured state-space-based and attention hybrid model to address these challenges. In addition to a first pre-training, a second pre-training stage allows us to specialise the model with high-quality data. We employ single nucleotide tokenization of mRNA sequences with codon separation, ensuring prior biological and structural information from the original mRNA sequence is not lost. Our model, Helix-mRNA, outperforms existing methods in analysing both UTRs and coding region properties. It can process sequences 6x longer than current approaches while using only 10% of the parameters of existing foundation models. Its predictive capabilities extend to all mRNA regions. We open-source the model (https://github.com/helicalAI/helical) and model weights (https://huggingface.co/helical-ai/helix-mRNA).</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

For pixel-wise regression tasks, confidence quantification and assessment has not been well addressed in the literature, in contrast to classification tasks like semantic segmentation. The softmax output layer is not used in deep neural networks that solve pixel-wise regression problems. In this paper, to address these problems, we develop, train and evaluate the proposed model Confidence-Aware Regression Estimation (CARE). Our model CARE computes and assigns confidence to regression output results. We focus on solving regression problems as downstream tasks of an AI Foundation Model for Earth Observation (EO). We evaluate the proposed model CARE and experimental results on data from the Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite constellation for estimating the density of buildings show that the proposed method can be successfully applied to regression problems.

Despite their empirical success, our theoretical understanding of KGFMs remains very limited. In this paper, we conduct a rigorous study of the expressive power of KGFMs. Specifically, we show that the expressive power of KGFMs directly depends on the motifs that are used to learn the relation representations. We then observe that the most typical motifs used in the existing literature are binary, as the representations are learned based on how pairs of relations interact, which limits the model's expressiveness. As part of our study, we design more expressive KGFMs using richer motifs, which necessitate learning relation representations based on, e.g., how triples of relations interact with each other. Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical findings, showing that the use of richer motifs results in better performance on a wide range of datasets drawn from different domains.</p></details> |  |

Magma is a significant extension of vision-language (VL) models in that it not only retains the VL understanding ability (verbal intelligence) of the latter, but is also equipped with the ability to plan and act in the visual-spatial world (spatial-temporal intelligence) and complete agentic tasks ranging from UI navigation to robot manipulation. To endow the agentic capabilities, Magma is pretrained on large amounts of heterogeneous datasets spanning from images, videos to robotics data, where the actionable visual objects (e.g., clickable buttons in GUI) in images are labeled by Set-of-Mark (SoM) for action grounding, and the object movements (e.g., the trace of human hands or robotic arms) in videos are labeled by Trace-of-Mark (ToM) for action planning. Extensive experiments show that SoM and ToM reach great synergy and facilitate the acquisition of spatial-temporal intelligence for our Magma model, which is fundamental to a wide range of tasks as shown in Fig.1. In particular, Magma creates new state-of-the-art results on UI navigation and robotic manipulation tasks, outperforming previous models that are specifically tailored to these tasks. On image and video-related multimodal tasks, Magma also compares favorably to popular large multimodal models that are trained on much larger datasets. We make our model and code public for reproducibility at https://microsoft.github.io/Magma.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 16 figures, technical report from MSR</p></details> |

FMs are trained on numerous diverse datasets and claim to be effective forecasters across multiple different time series domains, including cloud data. In this work we investigate this claim, exploring the effectiveness of FMs on cloud data. We demonstrate that many well-known FMs fail to generate meaningful or accurate zero-shot forecasts in this setting. We support this claim empirically, showing that FMs are outperformed consistently by simple linear baselines. We also illustrate a number of interesting pathologies, including instances where FMs suddenly output seemingly erratic, random-looking forecasts. Our results suggest a widespread failure of FMs to model cloud data.</p></details> | 5 pages, Preprint |
| **[Lightweight Online Adaption for Time Series Foundation Model Forecasts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12920v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) have emerged as a promising approach for time series forecasting. While effective, FMs typically remain fixed during deployment due to the high computational costs of learning them online. Consequently, deployed FMs fail to adapt their forecasts to current data characteristics, despite the availability of online feedback from newly arriving data. This raises the question of whether FM performance can be enhanced by the efficient usage of this feedback. We propose AdapTS to answer this question. AdapTS is a lightweight mechanism for the online adaption of FM forecasts in response to online feedback. AdapTS consists of two parts: a) the AdapTS-Forecaster which is used to learn the current data distribution; and b) the AdapTS-Weighter which is used to combine the forecasts of the FM and the AdapTS-Forecaster. We evaluate the performance of AdapTS in conjunction with several recent FMs across a suite of standard time series datasets. In all of our experiments we find that using AdapTS improves performance. This work demonstrates how efficient usage of online feedback can be used to improve FM forecasts.</p></details> | 8 pages, Preprint |

Additionally, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are critical for representing the spatial relationships among EEG sensors. However, fine-tuning these large-scale models for both temporal and spatial features can be prohibitively large in computational cost, especially under the limited availability of labeled EEG datasets. We propose EEG-GraphAdapter (EGA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approach designed to address these challenges. EGA is integrated into a pre-trained temporal backbone model as a GNN-based module, freezing the backbone and allowing only the adapter to be fine-tuned. This enables the effective acquisition of EEG spatial representations, significantly reducing computational overhead and data requirements. Experimental evaluations on two healthcare-related downstream tasks-Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Abnormality Detection (TUAB)-show that EGA improves performance by up to 16.1% in F1-score compared with the backbone BENDR model, highlighting its potential for scalable and accurate EEG-based predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted AAAI W3PHIAI-25 Workshop</p></details> |

Existing pretraining approaches predominantly rely on masked reconstruction or next-token prediction strategies, demonstrating strong performance across various downstream tasks, including geoscience applications. However, these approaches do not fully capture the causal interplay between different geospatial and environmental variables. To address this limitation, we propose Causally Informed Variable-Step Forecasting (CI-VSF), a novel pretraining task that models forecasting as a conditional generation task, where driver variables (e.g., weather) inform the prediction of response variables (e.g., satellite imagery). We demonstrate that pretraining in such a fashion leads to enhanced performance when finetuned on both prediction (e.g., crop mapping, missing image prediction, soil moisture estimation) and forecasting (e.g., future image forecasting, soil moisture forecasting) downstream tasks when compared to other pretraining approaches. While we use remote sensing as our main application to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed pretraining strategy over existing paradigms, it is applicable to any domain that involves known causal relationships amongst a set of variables.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages with appendix</p></details> |

These models transcend language and domain barriers, yet effectively measuring their performance remains a challenge. Traditional metrics like word error rate (WER) and character error rate (CER) are commonly used to evaluate ASR performance but often fail to reflect transcription quality in critical contexts, particularly when detecting fabricated outputs. This phenomenon, known as hallucination, is especially concerning in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, legal, and aviation, where errors can have severe consequences. In our work, we address this gap by investigating hallucination in ASR models. We examine how factors such as distribution shifts, model size, and model architecture influence the hallucination error rate (HER), a metric we introduce to quantify hallucinations. Our analysis of 20 ASR models reveals \numinsights~key insights: (1) High WERs can mask low hallucination rates, while low WERs may conceal dangerous hallucinations. (2) Synthetic noise, both adversarial and common perturbations like white noise, pitch shift, and time stretching, increase HER. (3) Distribution shift correlates strongly with HER ($\alpha = 0.91$). Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating HER alongside traditional metrics like WER to better assess ASR model performance, particularly in high-stakes domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally as co-first authors.

Extending these capabilities to unseen multimodal distributions, i.e., multimodal domain adaptation and generalization, is even more challenging due to the distinct characteristics of different modalities. Significant progress has been made over the years, with applications ranging from action recognition to semantic segmentation. Besides, the recent advent of large-scale pre-trained multimodal foundation models, such as CLIP, has inspired works leveraging these models to enhance adaptation and generalization performances or adapting them to downstream tasks. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of recent advances from traditional approaches to foundation models, covering: (1) Multimodal domain adaptation; (2) Multimodal test-time adaptation; (3) Multimodal domain generalization; (4) Domain adaptation and generalization with the help of multimodal foundation models; and (5) Adaptation of multimodal foundation models.

We employ Natural Language Processing to quantify the moral and affective linguistic markers. At the same time, we automatically define thematic macro areas of news from major U.S. news outlets and their Twitter followers (Jan 2020 - Mar 2021). By applying Non-Negative Matrix Factorisation to the obtained linguistic features we extract clusters of similar moral and affective profiles, and we identify the emotional and moral characteristics that mostly explain user engagement via regression modelling. We observe that Surprise, Trust, and Harm are crucial elements explaining user engagement and discussion length and that Twitter content from news media outlets has more explanatory power than their linked articles. We contribute with actionable findings evidencing the potential impact of employing specific moral and affective nuances in public and journalistic discourse in today's communication landscape. In particular, our results emphasise the need to balance engagement strategies with potential priming risks in our evolving media landscape.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

To address this, we propose a causally grounded rating framework to study the robustness of Foundational Models for Time Series (FMTS) with respect to input perturbations. We evaluate our approach to the stock price prediction problem, a well-studied problem with easily accessible public data, evaluating six state-of-the-art (some multi-modal) FMTS across six prominent stocks spanning three industries. The ratings proposed by our framework effectively assess the robustness of FMTS and also offer actionable insights for model selection and deployment. Within the scope of our study, we find that (1) multi-modal FMTS exhibit better robustness and accuracy compared to their uni-modal versions and, (2) FMTS pre-trained on time series forecasting task exhibit better robustness and forecasting accuracy compared to general-purpose FMTS pre-trained across diverse settings. Further, to validate our framework's usability, we conduct a user study showcasing FMTS prediction errors along with our computed ratings. The study confirmed that our ratings reduced the difficulty for users in comparing the robustness of different systems.</p></details> |  |

However, current human sensing primarily depends on modalities such as cameras and LiDAR, each of which has its own strengths and limitations. Furthermore, existing multi-modal fusion solutions are typically designed for fixed modality combinations, requiring extensive retraining when modalities are added or removed for diverse scenarios. In this paper, we propose a modality-invariant foundation model for all modalities, X-Fi, to address this issue. X-Fi enables the independent or combinatory use of sensor modalities without additional training by utilizing a transformer structure to accommodate variable input sizes and incorporating a novel "X-fusion" mechanism to preserve modality-specific features during multimodal integration. This approach not only enhances adaptability but also facilitates the learning of complementary features across modalities. Extensive experiments conducted on the MM-Fi and XRF55 datasets, employing six distinct modalities, demonstrate that X-Fi achieves state-of-the-art performance in human pose estimation (HPE) and human activity recognition (HAR) tasks. The findings indicate that our proposed model can efficiently support a wide range of human sensing applications, ultimately contributing to the evolution of scalable, multimodal sensing technologies.</p></details> |  |

However, existing unsupervised deformable registration methods rely solely on intensity-based similarity metrics, lacking explicit anatomical knowledge, which limits their accuracy and robustness. Vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), can generate high-quality segmentation masks that provide explicit anatomical structure knowledge, addressing the limitations of traditional methods that depend only on intensity similarity. Based on this, we propose a novel SAM-assisted registration framework incorporating prototype learning and contour awareness. The framework includes: (1) Explicit anatomical information injection, where SAM-generated segmentation masks are used as auxiliary inputs throughout training and testing to ensure the consistency of anatomical information; (2) Prototype learning, which leverages segmentation masks to extract prototype features and aligns prototypes to optimize semantic correspondences between images; and (3) Contour-aware loss, a contour-aware loss is designed that leverages the edges of segmentation masks to improve the model's performance in fine-grained deformation fields. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple datasets, particularly in challenging scenarios with complex anatomical structures and ambiguous boundaries.

This study explores the use of ECG foundation models, specifically ST-MEM and ECG-FM, to enhance ACS risk assessment using prehospital ECG data collected in ambulances. Both models leverage self-supervised learning (SSL), with ST-MEM using a reconstruction-based approach and ECG-FM employing contrastive learning, capturing unique spatial and temporal ECG features. We evaluate the performance of these models individually and through a fusion approach, where their embeddings are combined for enhanced prediction. Results demonstrate that both foundation models outperform a baseline ResNet-50 model, with the fusion-based approach achieving the highest performance (AUROC: 0.843 +/- 0.006, AUCPR: 0.674 +/- 0.012). These findings highlight the potential of ECG foundation models for early ACS detection and motivate further exploration of advanced fusion strategies to maximize complementary feature utilization.</p></details> |  |

| **[Towards Neural Scaling Laws for Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12360v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling laws offer valuable insights into the design of time series foundation models (TSFMs). However, previous research has largely focused on the scaling laws of TSFMs for in-distribution (ID) data, leaving their out-of-distribution (OOD) scaling behavior and the influence of model architectures less explored. In this work, we examine two common TSFM architectures, encoder-only and decoder-only Transformers, and investigate their scaling behavior on both ID and OOD data. These models are trained and evaluated across varying parameter counts, compute budgets, and dataset sizes. Our experiments reveal that the log-likelihood loss of TSFMs exhibits similar scaling behavior in both OOD and ID settings. We further compare the scaling properties across different architectures, incorporating two state-of-the-art TSFMs as case studies, showing that model architecture plays a significant role in scaling. The encoder-only Transformers demonstrate better scalability than the decoder-only Transformers, while the architectural enhancements in the two advanced TSFMs primarily improve ID performance but reduce OOD scalability. While scaling up TSFMs is expected to drive performance breakthroughs, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of TSFM scaling laws has hindered the development of a robust framework to guide model scaling. We fill this gap in this work by synthesizing our findings and providing practical guidelines for designing and scaling larger TSFMs with enhanced model capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |
| **[WRT-SAM: Foundation Model-Driven Segmentation for Generalized Weld Radiographic Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11338v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiographic testing is a fundamental non-destructive evaluation technique for identifying weld defects and assessing quality in industrial applications due to its high-resolution imaging capabilities. Over the past decade, deep learning techniques have significantly advanced weld defect identification in radiographic images. However, conventional approaches, which rely on training small-scale, task-specific models on single-scenario datasets, exhibit poor cross-scenario generalization. Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a pre-trained visual foundation model trained on large-scale datasets, has demonstrated exceptional zero-shot generalization capabilities. Fine-tuning SAM with limited domain-specific data has yielded promising results in fields such as medical image segmentation and anomaly detection. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to introduce SAM-based segmentation for general weld radiographic testing images. We propose WRT-SAM, a novel weld radiographic defect segmentation model that leverages SAM through an adapter-based integration with a specialized prompt generator architecture. To improve adaptability to grayscale weld radiographic images, we introduce a frequency prompt generator module, which enhances the model's sensitivity to frequency-domain information. Furthermore, to address the multi-scale nature of weld defects, we incorporate a multi-scale prompt generator module, enabling the model to effectively extract and encode defect information across varying scales. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that WRT-SAM achieves a recall of 78.87%, a precision of 84.04%, and an AUC of 0.9746, setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmark. Moreover, the model exhibits superior zero-shot generalization performance, highlighting its potential for practical deployment in diverse radiographic testing scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Responsible Foundation Model Development Cheatsheet: A Review of Tools & Resources](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16746v4)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation model development attracts a rapidly expanding body of contributors, scientists, and applications. To help shape responsible development practices, we introduce the Foundation Model Development Cheatsheet: a growing collection of 250+ tools and resources spanning text, vision, and speech modalities. We draw on a large body of prior work to survey resources (e.g. software, documentation, frameworks, guides, and practical tools) that support informed data selection, processing, and understanding, precise and limitation-aware artifact documentation, efficient model training, advance awareness of the environmental impact from training, careful model evaluation of capabilities, risks, and claims, as well as responsible model release, licensing and deployment practices. We hope this curated collection of resources helps guide more responsible development. The process of curating this list, enabled us to review the AI development ecosystem, revealing what tools are critically missing, misused, or over-used in existing practices. We find that (i) tools for data sourcing, model evaluation, and monitoring are critically under-serving ethical and real-world needs, (ii) evaluations for model safety, capabilities, and environmental impact all lack reproducibility and transparency, (iii) text and particularly English-centric analyses continue to dominate over multilingual and multi-modal analyses, and (iv) evaluation of systems, rather than just models, is needed so that capabilities and impact are assessed in context.</p></details> |  |
| **[Surgical Scene Understanding in the Era of Foundation AI Models: A Comprehensive Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14886v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), particularly through the introduction of foundational models (FMs), have significantly enhanced surgical scene understanding within minimally invasive surgery (MIS). This paper surveys the integration of state-of-the-art ML and DL technologies, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViTs), and foundational models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), into surgical workflows. These technologies improve segmentation accuracy, instrument tracking, and phase recognition in surgical endoscopic video analysis. The paper explores the challenges these technologies face, such as data variability and computational demands, and discusses ethical considerations and integration hurdles in clinical settings. Highlighting the roles of FMs, we bridge the technological capabilities with clinical needs and outline future research directions to enhance the adaptability, efficiency, and ethical alignment of AI applications in surgery. Our findings suggest that substantial progress has been made; however, more focused efforts are required to achieve seamless integration of these technologies into clinical workflows, ensuring they complement surgical practice by enhancing precision, reducing risks, and optimizing patient outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[CL-MFAP: A Contrastive Learning-Based Multimodal Foundation Model for Molecular Property Prediction and Antibiotic Screening](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11001v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the rise in antimicrobial resistance, identifying novel compounds with antibiotic potential is crucial for combatting this global health issue. However, traditional drug development methods are costly and inefficient. Recognizing the pressing need for more effective solutions, researchers have turned to machine learning techniques to streamline the prediction and development of novel antibiotic compounds. While foundation models have shown promise in antibiotic discovery, current mainstream efforts still fall short of fully leveraging the potential of multimodal molecular data. Recent studies suggest that contrastive learning frameworks utilizing multimodal data exhibit excellent performance in representation learning across various domains. Building upon this, we introduce CL-MFAP, an unsupervised contrastive learning (CL)-based multimodal foundation (MF) model specifically tailored for discovering small molecules with potential antibiotic properties (AP) using three types of molecular data. This model employs 1.6 million bioactive molecules with drug-like properties from the ChEMBL dataset to jointly pretrain three encoders: (1) a transformer-based encoder with rotary position embedding for processing SMILES strings; (2) another transformer-based encoder, incorporating a novel bi-level routing attention mechanism to handle molecular graph representations; and (3) a Morgan fingerprint encoder using a multilayer perceptron, to achieve the contrastive learning purpose. The CL-MFAP outperforms baseline models in antibiotic property prediction by effectively utilizing different molecular modalities and demonstrates superior domain-specific performance when fine-tuned for antibiotic-related property prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Gen Z...</summary><p>Gen Zhou and Sugitha Janarthanan contributed equally; Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[The Philosophical Foundations of Growing AI Like A Child](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10742v1)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite excelling in high-level reasoning, current language models lack robustness in real-world scenarios and perform poorly on fundamental problem-solving tasks that are intuitive to humans. This paper argues that both challenges stem from a core discrepancy between human and machine cognitive development. While both systems rely on increasing representational power, the absence of core knowledge-foundational cognitive structures in humans-prevents language models from developing robust, generalizable abilities, where complex skills are grounded in simpler ones within their respective domains. It explores empirical evidence of core knowledge in humans, analyzes why language models fail to acquire it, and argues that this limitation is not an inherent architectural constraint. Finally, it outlines a workable proposal for systematically integrating core knowledge into future multi-modal language models through the large-scale generation of synthetic training data using a cognitive prototyping strategy.</p></details> |  |

The recent rise of biomedical foundation models creates new hurdles in testing and certification given their broad capabilities and susceptibility to complex distribution shifts. To balance test feasibility and effectiveness, we suggest a priority-based, task-oriented approach to tailor robustness evaluation objectives to a predefined specification. We urge concrete policies to adopt a granular categorization of robustness concepts in the specification. Our approach promotes the standardization of risk assessment and monitoring, which guides technical developments and mitigation efforts.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review, comments welcome</p></details> |
| **[SPIRIT: Short-term Prediction of solar IRradIance for zero-shot Transfer learning using Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10307v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional solar forecasting models are based on several years of site-specific historical irradiance data, often spanning five or more years, which are unavailable for newer photovoltaic farms. As renewable energy is highly intermittent, building accurate solar irradiance forecasting systems is essential for efficient grid management and enabling the ongoing proliferation of solar energy, which is crucial to achieve the United Nations' net zero goals. In this work, we propose SPIRIT, a novel approach leveraging foundation models for solar irradiance forecasting, making it applicable to newer solar installations. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models in zero-shot transfer learning by about 70%, enabling effective performance at new locations without relying on any historical data. Further improvements in performance are achieved through fine-tuning, as more location-specific data becomes available. These findings are supported by statistical significance, further validating our approach. SPIRIT represents a pivotal step towards rapid, scalable, and adaptable solar forecasting solutions, advancing the integration of renewable energy into global power systems.</p></details> |  |
