| **[Intelligent Spatial Perception by Building Hierarchical 3D Scene Graphs for Indoor Scenarios with the Help of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15091v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the high demand in advanced intelligent robot navigation for a more holistic understanding of spatial environments, by introducing a novel system that harnesses the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct hierarchical 3D Scene Graphs (3DSGs) for indoor scenarios. The proposed framework constructs 3DSGs consisting of a fundamental layer with rich metric-semantic information, an object layer featuring precise point-cloud representation of object nodes as well as visual descriptors, and higher layers of room, floor, and building nodes. Thanks to the innovative application of LLMs, not only object nodes but also nodes of higher layers, e.g., room nodes, are annotated in an intelligent and accurate manner. A polling mechanism for room classification using LLMs is proposed to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the room node annotation. Thorough numerical experiments demonstrate the system's ability to integrate semantic descriptions with geometric data, creating an accurate and comprehensive representation of the environment instrumental for context-aware navigation and task planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by WRC SARA 2024</p></details> |
| **[Embedding spatial context in urban traffic forecasting with contrastive pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14980v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban traffic forecasting is a commonly encountered problem, with wide-ranging applications in fields such as urban planning, civil engineering and transport. In this paper, we study the enhancement of traffic forecasting with pre-training, focusing on spatio-temporal graph methods. While various machine learning methods to solve traffic forecasting problems have been explored and extensively studied, there is a gap of a more contextual approach: studying how relevant non-traffic data can improve prediction performance on traffic forecasting problems. We call this data spatial context. We introduce a novel method of combining road and traffic information through the notion of a traffic quotient graph, a quotient graph formed from road geometry and traffic sensors. We also define a way to encode this relationship in the form of a geometric encoder, pre-trained using contrastive learning methods and enhanced with OpenStreetMap data. We introduce and discuss ways to integrate this geometric encoder with existing graph neural network (GNN)-based traffic forecasting models, using a contrastive pre-training paradigm. We demonstrate the potential for this hybrid model to improve generalisation and performance with zero additional traffic data. Code for this paper is available at https://github.com/mattchrlw/forecasting-on-new-roads.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages with references, 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[Bayesian inference for case-control point pattern data in spatial epidemiology with the \texttt{inlabru} R package](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14954v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The analysis of case-control point pattern data is an important problem in spatial epidemiology. The spatial variation of cases if often compared to that of a set of controls to assess spatial risk variation as well as the detection of risk factors and exposure to putative pollution sources using spatial regression models. The intensities of the point patterns of cases and controls are estimated using log-Gaussian Cox models, so that fixed and spatial random effects can be included. Bayesian inference is conducted via the integrated Nested Laplace approximation (INLA) method using the inlabru R package. In this way, potential risk factors can be assessed by including them as fixed effects while residual spatial variation is considered as a Gaussian process with Mat\'ern covariance. In addition, exposure to pollution sources is modeled using different smooth terms. The proposed methods have been applied to the Chorley-Ribble dataset, that records the locations of lung and larynx cancer cases as well as the location of an disused old incinerator in the area of Lancashire (England, United Kingdom). Taking the locations of lung cancer as controls, the spatial variation of both types of cases has been estimated and the increase of larynx cases in the vicinity of the incinerator has been assessed. The results are similar to those found in the literature. In a nutshell, a framework for Bayesian analysis of multivariate case-control point patterns within an epidemiological framework has been presented. Models to assess spatial variation and the effect of risk factors and pollution sources can be fit with ease with the inlabru R package.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpatialBot: Precise Spatial Understanding with Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13642v7)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in 2D image understanding, however they are still struggling with spatial understanding which is the foundation of Embodied AI. In this paper, we propose SpatialBot for better spatial understanding by feeding both RGB and depth images. Additionally, we have constructed the SpatialQA dataset, which involves multi-level depth-related questions to train VLMs for depth understanding. Finally, we present SpatialBench to comprehensively evaluate VLMs' capabilities in spatial understanding at different levels. Extensive experiments on our spatial-understanding benchmark, general VLM benchmarks and Embodied AI tasks, demonstrate the remarkable improvements of SpatialBot trained on SpatialQA. The model, code and data are available at https://github.com/BAAI-DCAI/SpatialBot.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semiparametric Copula Estimation for Spatially Correlated Multivariate Mixed Outcomes: Analyzing Visual Sightings of Fin Whales from Line Transect Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12710v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For marine biologists, ascertaining the dependence structures between marine species and marine environments, such as sea surface temperature and ocean depth, is imperative for defining ecosystem functioning and providing insights into the dynamics of marine ecosystems. However, obtained data include not only continuous but also discrete data, such as binaries and counts (referred to as mixed outcomes), as well as spatial correlations, both of which make conventional multivariate analysis tools impractical. To solve this issue, we propose semiparametric Bayesian inference and develop an efficient algorithm for computing the posterior of the dependence structure based on the rank likelihood under a latent multivariate spatial Gaussian process using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. To alleviate the computational intractability caused by the Gaussian process, we also provide a scalable implementation that leverages the nearest-neighbor Gaussian process. Extensive numerical experiments reveal that the proposed method reliably infers the dependence structures of spatially correlated mixed outcomes. Finally, we apply the proposed method to a dataset collected during an international synoptic krill survey in the Scotia Sea of the Antarctic Peninsula to infer the dependence structure between fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus), krill biomass, and relevant oceanographic data.</p></details> | 29 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Variational Autoencoded Multivariate Spatial Fay-Herriot Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14710v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Small area estimation models are essential for estimating population characteristics in regions with limited sample sizes, thereby supporting policy decisions, demographic studies, and resource allocation, among other use cases. The spatial Fay-Herriot model is one such approach that incorporates spatial dependence to improve estimation by borrowing strength from neighboring regions. However, this approach often requires substantial computational resources, limiting its scalability for high-dimensional datasets, especially when considering multiple (multivariate) responses. This paper proposes two methods that integrate the multivariate spatial Fay-Herriot model with spatial random effects, learned through variational autoencoders, to efficiently leverage spatial structure. Importantly, after training the variational autoencoder to represent spatial dependence for a given set of geographies, it may be used again in future modeling efforts, without the need for retraining. Additionally, the use of the variational autoencoder to represent spatial dependence results in extreme improvements in computational efficiency, even for massive datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using 5-year period estimates from the American Community Survey over all census tracts in California.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weakly Supervised Spatial Implicit Neural Representation Learning for 3D MRI-Ultrasound Deformable Image Registration in HDR Prostate Brachytherapy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14395v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Accurate 3D MRI-ultrasound (US) deformable registration is critical for real-time guidance in high-dose-rate (HDR) prostate brachytherapy. We present a weakly supervised spatial implicit neural representation (SINR) method to address modality differences and pelvic anatomy challenges. Methods: The framework uses sparse surface supervision from MRI/US segmentations instead of dense intensity matching. SINR models deformations as continuous spatial functions, with patient-specific surface priors guiding a stationary velocity field for biologically plausible deformations. Validation included 20 public Prostate-MRI-US-Biopsy cases and 10 institutional HDR cases, evaluated via Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), mean surface distance (MSD), and 95% Hausdorff distance (HD95). Results: The proposed method achieved robust registration. For the public dataset, prostate DSC was $0.93 \pm 0.05$, MSD $0.87 \pm 0.10$ mm, and HD95 $1.58 \pm 0.37$ mm. For the institutional dataset, prostate CTV achieved DSC $0.88 \pm 0.09$, MSD $1.21 \pm 0.38$ mm, and HD95 $2.09 \pm 1.48$ mm. Bladder and rectum performance was lower due to ultrasound's limited field of view. Visual assessments confirmed accurate alignment with minimal discrepancies. Conclusion: This study introduces a novel weakly supervised SINR-based approach for 3D MRI-US deformable registration. By leveraging sparse surface supervision and spatial priors, it achieves accurate, robust, and computationally efficient registration, enhancing real-time image guidance in HDR prostate brachytherapy and improving treatment precision.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniMamba: Unified Spatial-Channel Representation Learning with Group-Efficient Mamba for LiDAR-based 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12009v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in LiDAR 3D detection have demonstrated the effectiveness of Transformer-based frameworks in capturing the global dependencies from point cloud spaces, which serialize the 3D voxels into the flattened 1D sequence for iterative self-attention. However, the spatial structure of 3D voxels will be inevitably destroyed during the serialization process. Besides, due to the considerable number of 3D voxels and quadratic complexity of Transformers, multiple sequences are grouped before feeding to Transformers, leading to a limited receptive field. Inspired by the impressive performance of State Space Models (SSM) achieved in the field of 2D vision tasks, in this paper, we propose a novel Unified Mamba (UniMamba), which seamlessly integrates the merits of 3D convolution and SSM in a concise multi-head manner, aiming to perform "local and global" spatial context aggregation efficiently and simultaneously. Specifically, a UniMamba block is designed which mainly consists of spatial locality modeling, complementary Z-order serialization and local-global sequential aggregator. The spatial locality modeling module integrates 3D submanifold convolution to capture the dynamic spatial position embedding before serialization. Then the efficient Z-order curve is adopted for serialization both horizontally and vertically. Furthermore, the local-global sequential aggregator adopts the channel grouping strategy to efficiently encode both "local and global" spatial inter-dependencies using multi-head SSM. Additionally, an encoder-decoder architecture with stacked UniMamba blocks is formed to facilitate multi-scale spatial learning hierarchically. Extensive experiments are conducted on three popular datasets: nuScenes, Waymo and Argoverse 2. Particularly, our UniMamba achieves 70.2 mAP on the nuScenes dataset.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2025 |
| **[Design of an Expression Recognition Solution Employing the Global Channel-Spatial Attention Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11935v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial expression recognition is a challenging classification task with broad application prospects in the field of human - computer interaction. This paper aims to introduce the methods of our upcoming 8th Affective Behavior Analysis in the Wild (ABAW) competition to be held at CVPR2025. To address issues such as low recognition accuracy caused by subtle expression changes and multi - scales in facial expression recognition in videos, we propose global channel - spatial attention and median - enhanced spatial - channel attention to strengthen feature processing for speech and images respectively. Secondly, to fully utilize the complementarity between the speech and facial expression modalities, a speech - and - facial - expression key - frame alignment technique is adopted to calculate the weights of speech and facial expressions. These weights are input into the feature fusion layer for multi - scale dilated fusion, which effectively improves the recognition rate of facial expression recognition. In the facial expression recognition task of the 6th ABAW competition, our method achieved excellent results on the official validation set, which fully demonstrates the effectiveness and competitiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[AugMapNet: Improving Spatial Latent Structure via BEV Grid Augmentation for Enhanced Vectorized Online HD Map Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13430v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving requires an understanding of the infrastructure elements, such as lanes and crosswalks. To navigate safely, this understanding must be derived from sensor data in real-time and needs to be represented in vectorized form. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to combine a set of camera images from multiple views into one joint latent BEV grid. Traditionally, from this latent space, an intermediate raster map is predicted, providing dense spatial supervision but requiring post-processing into the desired vectorized form. More recent models directly derive infrastructure elements as polylines using vectorized map decoders, providing instance-level information. Our approach, Augmentation Map Network (AugMapNet), proposes latent BEV grid augmentation, a novel technique that significantly enhances the latent BEV representation. AugMapNet combines vector decoding and dense spatial supervision more effectively than existing architectures while remaining as straightforward to integrate and as generic as auxiliary supervision. Experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate significant improvements in vectorized map prediction performance up to 13.3% over the StreamMapNet baseline on 60m range and greater improvements on larger ranges. We confirm transferability by applying our method to another baseline and find similar improvements. A detailed analysis of the latent BEV grid confirms a more structured latent space of AugMapNet and shows the value of our novel concept beyond pure performance improvement. The code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization for Spatial Microstructure Control in Electron Beam Metal Additive Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18207v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metal additive manufacturing (AM) opens the possibility for spatial control of as-fabricated microstructure and properties. However, since the solid state diffusional transformations that drive microstructure outcomes are governed by nonlinear ODEs in terms of temperature, which is itself governed by PDEs over the entire part domain, solving for the system inputs needed to achieve desired microstructure distributions has proven difficult. In this work, we present a trajectory optimization approach for spatial control of microstructure in metal AM, which we demonstrate by controlling the hardness of a low-alloy steel in electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF). To this end, we present models for thermal and microstructural dynamics. Next, we use experimental data to identify the parameters of the microstructure transformation dynamics. We then pose spatial microstructure control as a finite-horizon optimal control problem. The optimal power field trajectory is computed using an augmented Lagrangian differential dynamic programming (AL-DDP) method with GPU acceleration. The resulting time-varying power fields are then realized on an EB-PBF machine through an approximation scheme. Measurements of the resultant hardness shows that the optimized power field trajectory is able to closely produce the desired hardness distribution.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |
| **[MM-Spatial: Exploring 3D Spatial Understanding in Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13111v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at 2D visual understanding but remain limited in their ability to reason about 3D space. In this work, we leverage large-scale high-quality 3D scene data with open-set annotations to introduce 1) a novel supervised fine-tuning dataset and 2) a new evaluation benchmark, focused on indoor scenes. Our Cubify Anything VQA (CA-VQA) data covers diverse spatial tasks including spatial relationship prediction, metric size and distance estimation, and 3D grounding. We show that CA-VQA enables us to train MM-Spatial, a strong generalist MLLM that also achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D spatial understanding benchmarks, including our own. We show how incorporating metric depth and multi-view inputs (provided in CA-VQA) can further improve 3D understanding, and demonstrate that data alone allows our model to achieve depth perception capabilities comparable to dedicated monocular depth estimation models. We will publish our SFT dataset and benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Spatially Adaptive $\ell_1$-Norms Weights for Convolutional Synthesis Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09483v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an unrolled algorithm approach for learning spatially adaptive parameter maps in the framework of convolutional synthesis-based $\ell_1$ regularization. More precisely, we consider a family of pre-trained convolutional filters and estimate deeply parametrized spatially varying parameters applied to the sparse feature maps by means of unrolling a FISTA algorithm to solve the underlying sparse estimation problem. The proposed approach is evaluated for image reconstruction of low-field MRI and compared to spatially adaptive and non-adaptive analysis-type procedures relying on Total Variation regularization and to a well-established model-based deep learning approach. We show that the proposed approach produces visually and quantitatively comparable results with the latter approaches and at the same time remains highly interpretable. In particular, the inferred parameter maps quantify the local contribution of each filter in the reconstruction, which provides valuable insight into the algorithm mechanism and could potentially be used to discard unsuited filters.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be submitted to the EUSIPCO 2025 conference</p></details> |

| **[Logic-RAG: Augmenting Large Multimodal Models with Visual-Spatial Knowledge for Road Scene Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12663v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large multimodal models (LMMs) are increasingly integrated into autonomous driving systems for user interaction. However, their limitations in fine-grained spatial reasoning pose challenges for system interpretability and user trust. We introduce Logic-RAG, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that improves LMMs' spatial understanding in driving scenarios. Logic-RAG constructs a dynamic knowledge base (KB) about object-object relationships in first-order logic (FOL) using a perception module, a query-to-logic embedder, and a logical inference engine. We evaluated Logic-RAG on visual-spatial queries using both synthetic and real-world driving videos. When using popular LMMs (GPT-4V, Claude 3.5) as proxies for an autonomous driving system, these models achieved only 55% accuracy on synthetic driving scenes and under 75% on real-world driving scenes. Augmenting them with Logic-RAG increased their accuracies to over 80% and 90%, respectively. An ablation study showed that even without logical inference, the fact-based context constructed by Logic-RAG alone improved accuracy by 15%. Logic-RAG is extensible: it allows seamless replacement of individual components with improved versions and enables domain experts to compose new knowledge in both FOL and natural language. In sum, Logic-RAG addresses critical spatial reasoning deficiencies in LMMs for autonomous driving applications. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Imran2205/LogicRAG.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging Foundation Models (FMs) for spatial reasoning and active view planning, our framework constructs and updates an instance-centric representation of spatial relationships, enhancing grasp success under challenging occlusions. Furthermore, this representation facilitates active Next-Best-View (NBV) planning and optimizes sequential grasping strategies when direct grasping is infeasible. Additionally, we introduce a multi-view uncertainty-driven grasp fusion mechanism that refines grasp confidence and directional uncertainty in real-time, ensuring robust and stable grasp execution. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that VISO-Grasp achieves a success rate of $87.5\%$ in target-oriented grasping with the fewest grasp attempts outperforming baselines. To the best of our knowledge, VISO-Grasp is the first unified framework integrating FMs into target-aware active view planning and 6-DoF grasping in environments with severe occlusions and entire invisibility constraints.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[GravMAD: Grounded Spatial Value Maps Guided Action Diffusion for Generalized 3D Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20154v7)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots' ability to follow language instructions and execute diverse 3D manipulation tasks is vital in robot learning. Traditional imitation learning-based methods perform well on seen tasks but struggle with novel, unseen ones due to variability. Recent approaches leverage large foundation models to assist in understanding novel tasks, thereby mitigating this issue. However, these methods lack a task-specific learning process, which is essential for an accurate understanding of 3D environments, often leading to execution failures. In this paper, we introduce GravMAD, a sub-goal-driven, language-conditioned action diffusion framework that combines the strengths of imitation learning and foundation models. Our approach breaks tasks into sub-goals based on language instructions, allowing auxiliary guidance during both training and inference. During training, we introduce Sub-goal Keypose Discovery to identify key sub-goals from demonstrations. Inference differs from training, as there are no demonstrations available, so we use pre-trained foundation models to bridge the gap and identify sub-goals for the current task. In both phases, GravMaps are generated from sub-goals, providing GravMAD with more flexible 3D spatial guidance compared to fixed 3D positions. Empirical evaluations on RLBench show that GravMAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with a 28.63% improvement on novel tasks and a 13.36% gain on tasks encountered during training. Evaluations on real-world robotic tasks further show that GravMAD can reason about real-world tasks, associate them with relevant visual information, and generalize to novel tasks. These results demonstrate GravMAD's strong multi-task learning and generalization in 3D manipulation. Video demonstrations are available at: https://gravmad.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025. The first two authors contributed equally</p></details> |
| **[Community Detection Analysis of Spatial Transcriptomics Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12351v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spatial transcriptomics (ST) data produced by recent biotechnologies, such as CosMx and Xenium, contain huge amount of information about cancer tissue samples, which has great potential for cancer research via detection of community: a collection of cells with distinct cell-type composition and similar neighboring patterns. But existing clustering methods do not work well for community detection of CosMx ST data, and the commonly used kNN compositional data method shows lack of informative neighboring cell patterns for huge CosMx data. In this article, we propose a novel and more informative disk compositional data (DCD) method, which identifies neighboring patterns of each cell via taking into account of ST data features from recent new technologies. After initial processing ST data into DCD matrix, a new innovative and interpretable DCD-TMHC community detection method is proposed here. Extensive simulation studies and CosMx breast cancer data analysis clearly show that our proposed DCD-TMHC method is superior to other methods. Based on the communities detected by DCD-TMHC method for CosMx breast cancer data, the logistic regression analysis results demonstrate that DCD-TMHC method is clearly interpretable and superior, especially in terms of assessment for different stages of cancer. These suggest that our proposed novel, innovative, informative and interpretable DCD-TMHC method here will be helpful and have impact to future cancer research based on ST data, which can improve cancer diagnosis and monitor cancer treatment progress.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI's Spatial Intelligence: Evaluating AI's Understanding of Spatial Transformations in PSVT:R and Augmented Reality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06269v4)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial intelligence is important in Architecture, Construction, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), and Medicine. Understanding three-dimensional (3D) spatial rotations can involve verbal descriptions and visual or interactive examples, illustrating how objects change orientation in 3D space. Recent studies show Artificial Intelligence (AI) with language and vision capabilities still face limitations in spatial reasoning. In this paper, we have studied generative AI's spatial capabilities of understanding rotations of objects utilizing its image and language processing features. We examined the spatial intelligence of the GPT-4 model with vision in understanding spatial rotation process with diagrams based on the Revised Purdue Spatial Visualization Test: Visualization of Rotations (Revised PSVT:R). Next, we incorporated a layer of coordinate system axes on Revised PSVT:R to study the variations in GPT-4's performance. We also examined GPT-4's understanding of 3D rotations in Augmented Reality (AR) scenes that visualize spatial rotations of an object in 3D space and observed increased accuracy of GPT-4's understanding of the rotations by adding supplementary textual information depicting the rotation process or mathematical representations of the rotation (e.g., matrices). The results indicate that while GPT-4 as a major current Generative AI model lacks the understanding of a spatial rotation process, it has the potential to understand the rotation process with additional information that can be provided by methods such as AR. By combining the potentials in spatial intelligence of AI with AR's interactive visualization abilities, we expect to offer enhanced guidance for students' spatial learning activities. Such spatial guidance can benefit understanding spatial transformations and additionally support processes like assembly, fabrication, and manufacturing.</p></details> |  |
| **[PanDA: Towards Panoramic Depth Anything with Unlabeled Panoramas and Mobius Spatial Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13378v2)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Depth Anything Models (DAMs) - a type of depth foundation models - have demonstrated impressive zero-shot capabilities across diverse perspective images. Despite its success, it remains an open question regarding DAMs' performance on panorama images that enjoy a large field-of-view (180x360) but suffer from spherical distortions. To address this gap, we conduct an empirical analysis to evaluate the performance of DAMs on panoramic images and identify their limitations. For this, we undertake comprehensive experiments to assess the performance of DAMs from three key factors: panoramic representations, 360 camera positions for capturing scenarios, and spherical spatial transformations. This way, we reveal some key findings, e.g., DAMs are sensitive to spatial transformations. We then propose a semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework to learn a panoramic DAM, dubbed PanDA. Under the umbrella of SSL, PanDA first learns a teacher model by fine-tuning DAM through joint training on synthetic indoor and outdoor panoramic datasets. Then, a student model is trained using large-scale unlabeled data, leveraging pseudo-labels generated by the teacher model. To enhance PanDA's generalization capability, M"obius transformation-based spatial augmentation (MTSA) is proposed to impose consistency regularization between the predicted depth maps from the original and spatially transformed ones. This subtly improves the student model's robustness to various spatial transformations, even under severe distortions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PanDA exhibits remarkable zero-shot capability across diverse scenes, and outperforms the data-specific panoramic depth estimation methods on two popular real-world benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 18 figures, accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Semantic-Supervised Spatial-Temporal Fusion for LiDAR-based 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10579v2)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-based 3D object detection presents significant challenges due to the inherent sparsity of LiDAR points. A common solution involves long-term temporal LiDAR data to densify the inputs. However, efficiently leveraging spatial-temporal information remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Semantic-Supervised Spatial-Temporal Fusion (ST-Fusion) method, which introduces a novel fusion module to relieve the spatial misalignment caused by the object motion over time and a feature-level semantic supervision to sufficiently unlock the capacity of the proposed fusion module. Specifically, the ST-Fusion consists of a Spatial Aggregation (SA) module and a Temporal Merging (TM) module. The SA module employs a convolutional layer with progressively expanding receptive fields to aggregate the object features from the local regions to alleviate the spatial misalignment, the TM module dynamically extracts object features from the preceding frames based on the attention mechanism for a comprehensive sequential presentation. Besides, in the semantic supervision, we propose a Semantic Injection method to enrich the sparse LiDAR data via injecting the point-wise semantic labels, using it for training a teacher model and providing a reconstruction target at the feature level supervised by the proposed object-aware loss. Extensive experiments on various LiDAR-based detectors demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of our proposal, yielding an improvement of approximately +2.8% in NDS based on the nuScenes benchmark.</p></details> | Accepted by ICRA2025 |
| **[SPOC: Spatially-Progressing Object State Change Segmentation in Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11953v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object state changes in video reveal critical information about human and agent activity. However, existing methods are limited to temporal localization of when the object is in its initial state (e.g., the unchopped avocado) versus when it has completed a state change (e.g., the chopped avocado), which limits applicability for any task requiring detailed information about the progress of the actions and its spatial localization. We propose to deepen the problem by introducing the spatially-progressing object state change segmentation task. The goal is to segment at the pixel-level those regions of an object that are actionable and those that are transformed. We introduce the first model to address this task, designing a VLM-based pseudo-labeling approach, state-change dynamics constraints, and a novel WhereToChange benchmark built on in-the-wild Internet videos. Experiments on two datasets validate both the challenge of the new task as well as the promise of our model for localizing exactly where and how fast objects are changing in video. We further demonstrate useful implications for tracking activity progress to benefit robotic agents.

| **[Spatiotemporal clustering of GHGs emissions in Europe: exploring the role of spatial component](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11909v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we propose a novel application of spatiotemporal clustering in the environmental sciences, with a particular focus on regionalised time series of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions from a range of economic sectors. Utilising a hierarchical spatiotemporal clustering methodology, we analyse yearly time series of emissions by gases and sectors from 1990 to 2022 for European regions at the NUTS-2 level. While the clustering algorithm inherently incorporates spatial information based on geographical distance, the extent to which space contributes to the definition of groups still requires further exploration. To address this gap in the literature, we propose a novel indicator, namely the Joint Inertia, which quantifies the contribution of spatial distances when integrated with other features. Through a simulation experiment, we explore the relationship between the Joint Inertia and the relevance of geography in exploiting the groups structure under several configurations of spatial and features patterns, providing insights into the behaviour and potential of the proposed indicator. The empirical findings demonstrate the relevance of the spatial component in identifying emission patterns and dynamics, and the results reveal significant heterogeneity across clusters in trends and dynamics by gases and sectors. This reflects the heterogeneous economic and industrial characteristics of European regions. The study highlights the importance of the spatial and temporal dimensions in understanding GHGs emissions, offering baseline insights for future spatiotemporal modelling and supporting more targeted and regionally informed environmental policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing Spatial Disparities: A Bayesian Linear Regression Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19171v3)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Epidemiological investigations of regionally aggregated spatial data often involve detecting spatial health disparities among neighboring regions on a map of disease mortality or incidence rates. Analyzing such data introduces spatial dependence among the health outcomes and seeks to report statistically significant spatial disparities by delineating boundaries that separate neighboring regions with disparate health outcomes. However, there are statistical challenges to appropriately defining what constitutes a spatial disparity and to construct robust probabilistic inference for spatial disparities. We enrich the familiar Bayesian linear regression framework to introduce spatial autoregression and offer model-based detection of spatial disparities. We derive exploitable analytical tractability that considerably accelerates computation. Simulation experiments conducted over a county map of the entire United States demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and we apply our method to a data set from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) on age-standardized US county-level estimates of lung cancer mortality rates.</p></details> | 55 pages, 9 figures |

Implicitly infusing the spatial geometric prior knowledge acquired by a data-fusion teacher network into a single-modal student network is a practical, albeit less explored research avenue. This article delves into this topic and resorts to knowledge distillation approaches to address this problem. We introduce the Learning to Infuse ''X'' (LIX) framework, with novel contributions in both logit distillation and feature distillation aspects. We present a mathematical proof that underscores the limitation of using a single, fixed weight in decoupled knowledge distillation and introduce a logit-wise dynamic weight controller as a solution to this issue. Furthermore, we develop an adaptively-recalibrated feature distillation algorithm, including two novel techniques: feature recalibration via kernel regression and in-depth feature consistency quantification via centered kernel alignment. Extensive experiments conducted with intermediate-fusion and late-fusion networks across various public datasets provide both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, demonstrating the superior performance of our LIX framework when compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a novel benchmark, Open3DVQA, to comprehensively evaluate the spatial reasoning capacities of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) foundation models in open 3D space. Open3DVQA consists of 9k VQA samples, collected using an efficient semi-automated tool in a high-fidelity urban simulator. We evaluate several SOTA MLLMs across various aspects of spatial reasoning, such as relative and absolute spatial relationships, situational reasoning, and object-centric spatial attributes. Our results reveal that: 1) MLLMs perform better at answering questions regarding relative spatial relationships than absolute spatial relationships, 2) MLLMs demonstrate similar spatial reasoning abilities for both egocentric and allocentric perspectives, and 3) Fine-tuning large models significantly improves their performance across different spatial reasoning tasks. We believe that our open-source data collection tools and in-depth analyses will inspire further research on MLLM spatial reasoning capabilities. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/WeichenZh/Open3DVQA.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we propose EmbodiedVSR (Embodied Visual Spatial Reasoning), a novel framework that integrates dynamic scene graph-guided Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to enhance spatial understanding for embodied agents. By explicitly constructing structured knowledge representations through dynamic scene graphs, our method enables zero-shot spatial reasoning without task-specific fine-tuning. This approach not only disentangles intricate spatial relationships but also aligns reasoning steps with actionable environmental dynamics. To rigorously evaluate performance, we introduce the eSpatial-Benchmark, a comprehensive dataset including real-world embodied scenarios with fine-grained spatial annotations and adaptive task difficulty levels. Experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing MLLM-based methods in accuracy and reasoning coherence, particularly in long-horizon tasks requiring iterative environment interaction. The results reveal the untapped potential of MLLMs for embodied intelligence when equipped with structured, explainable reasoning mechanisms, paving the way for more reliable deployment in real-world spatial applications. The codes and datasets will be released soon.</p></details> | technical report |

We propose Spatial Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Spatial-RAG), a framework that extends RAG to spatial tasks by integrating sparse spatial retrieval (spatial databases) and dense semantic retrieval (LLM-based similarity). A multi-objective ranking strategy balances spatial constraints and semantic relevance, while an LLM-guided generator ensures coherent responses. Experiments on a real-world tourism dataset show that Spatial-RAG significantly improves spatial question answering, bridging the gap between LLMs and spatial intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Fourier Neural ODEs: Modeling Spatial-temporal Multi-scales in Molecular Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01600v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting long-horizon molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories remains a significant challenge, as existing deep learning methods often struggle to retain fidelity over extended simulations. We hypothesize that one key factor limiting accuracy is the difficulty of capturing interactions that span distinct spatial and temporal scales-ranging from high-frequency local vibrations to low-frequency global conformational changes. To address these limitations, we propose Graph Fourier Neural ODEs (GF-NODE), integrating a graph Fourier transform for spatial frequency decomposition with a Neural ODE framework for continuous-time evolution. Specifically, GF-NODE first decomposes molecular configurations into multiple spatial frequency modes using the graph Laplacian, then evolves the frequency components in time via a learnable Neural ODE module that captures both local and global dynamics, and finally reconstructs the updated molecular geometry through an inverse graph Fourier transform. By explicitly modeling high- and low-frequency phenomena in this unified pipeline, GF-NODE more effectively captures long-range correlations and local fluctuations alike. Experimental results on challenging MD benchmarks, including MD17 and alanine dipeptide, demonstrate that GF-NODE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while preserving essential geometrical features over extended simulations. These findings highlight the promise of bridging spectral decomposition with continuous-time modeling to improve the robustness and predictive power of MD simulations.</p></details> | Preprint |

Existing approaches mainly learn a policy to predict a distant next-best end-effector pose (NBP) and then compute the corresponding joint rotation angles for motion using inverse kinematics. However, they suffer from two important issues: (1) rarely considering the physical robotic structure, which may cause self-collisions or interferences, and (2) overlooking the kinematics constraint, which may result in the predicted poses not conforming to the actual limitations of the robot joints. In this paper, we propose Kinematics enhanced Spatial-TemporAl gRaph Diffuser (KStar Diffuser). Specifically, (1) to incorporate the physical robot structure information into action prediction, KStar Diffuser maintains a dynamic spatial-temporal graph according to the physical bimanual joint motions at continuous timesteps. This dynamic graph serves as the robot-structure condition for denoising the actions; (2) to make the NBP learning objective consistent with kinematics, we introduce the differentiable kinematics to provide the reference for optimizing KStar Diffuser. This module regularizes the policy to predict more reliable and kinematics-aware next end-effector poses. Experimental results show that our method effectively leverages the physical structural information and generates kinematics-aware actions in both simulation and real-world</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we rethink that the redundancy in inversion-based image editing exists in both the spatial and temporal dimensions, such as the unnecessary computation in unedited regions and the redundancy in the inversion progress. To tackle these challenges, we propose a practical framework, named EEdit, to achieve efficient image editing. Specifically, we introduce three techniques to solve them one by one. For spatial redundancy, spatial locality caching is introduced to compute the edited region and its neighboring regions while skipping the unedited regions, and token indexing preprocessing is designed to further accelerate the caching. For temporal redundancy, inversion step skipping is proposed to reuse the latent for efficient editing. Our experiments demonstrate an average of 2.46 $\times$ acceleration without performance drop in a wide range of editing tasks including prompt-guided image editing, dragging and image composition. Our codes are available at https://github.com/yuriYanZeXuan/EEdit</p></details> | 17 pages |

Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, primarily based on graph neural networks (GNNs), encounter difficulties in capturing long-term, long-distance, and fine-grained interactions among heterogeneous player nodes, as well as in recognizing interaction patterns. Additionally, they exhibit limited generalization to untrained downstream tasks and zero-shot scenarios. In this work, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Propagation Symmetry-Aware Graph Transformer for fine-grained game modeling. This architecture explicitly captures delay effects in the spatial space to enhance player node representations across discrete-time slices, employing symmetry-invariant priors to guide the attention mechanism. We also introduce an efficient contrastive learning strategy to train a Mixture of Tactics Experts module, facilitating differentiated modeling of offensive tactics. By integrating dense training with sparse inference, we achieve a 2.4x improvement in model efficiency. Moreover, the incorporation of Lightweight Graph Grounding for Large Language Models enables robust performance in open-ended downstream tasks and zero-shot scenarios, including novel teams or players. The proposed model, TacticExpert, delineates a vertically integrated large model framework for basketball, unifying pretraining across multiple datasets and downstream prediction tasks. Fine-grained modeling modules significantly enhance spatial-temporal representations, and visualization analyzes confirm the strong interpretability of the model.</p></details> |  |
| **[CleverDistiller: Simple and Spatially Consistent Cross-modal Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09878v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models (VFMs) such as DINO have led to a paradigm shift in 2D camera-based perception towards extracting generalized features to support many downstream tasks. Recent works introduce self-supervised cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) as a way to transfer these powerful generalization capabilities into 3D LiDAR-based models. However, they either rely on highly complex distillation losses, pseudo-semantic maps, or limit KD to features useful for semantic segmentation only. In this work, we propose CleverDistiller, a self-supervised, cross-modal 2D-to-3D KD framework introducing a set of simple yet effective design choices: Unlike contrastive approaches relying on complex loss design choices, our method employs a direct feature similarity loss in combination with a multi layer perceptron (MLP) projection head to allow the 3D network to learn complex semantic dependencies throughout the projection. Crucially, our approach does not depend on pseudo-semantic maps, allowing for direct knowledge transfer from a VFM without explicit semantic supervision. Additionally, we introduce the auxiliary self-supervised spatial task of occupancy prediction to enhance the semantic knowledge, obtained from a VFM through KD, with 3D spatial reasoning capabilities. Experiments on standard autonomous driving benchmarks for 2D-to-3D KD demonstrate that CleverDistiller achieves state-of-the-art performance in both semantic segmentation and 3D object detection (3DOD) by up to 10% mIoU, especially when fine tuning on really low data amounts, showing the effectiveness of our simple yet powerful KD strategy</p></details> |  |

While prior research has primarily focused on dyadic human-AI interactions, less attention has been given to Human-AI Teams (HATs) in AR, where AI acts as an adaptive teammate rather than a static tool. This position paper takes the perspective of team dynamics and work organization to propose that AI agents in AR should not only interact with individuals but also recognize and respond to team-level needs in real time. We argue that spatially aware AI agents should dynamically generate the resources necessary for effective collaboration, such as virtual blackboards for brainstorming, mental map models for shared understanding, and memory recall of spatial configurations to enhance knowledge retention and task coordination. This approach moves beyond predefined AI assistance toward context-driven AI interventions that optimize team performance and decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Posit...</summary><p>Positional paper for the CHI 2025 Everyday AR through AI-in-the-Loop Workshop</p></details> |

They enable high-frequency signal reconstruction and smooth manifold modeling; however, they often suffer from spectral bias, training instability, and overfitting. To address these challenges, we propose SASNet, Spatially-Adaptive SNNs that robustly enhance the capacity of compact INRs to fit detailed signals. SASNet integrates a frequency embedding layer to control frequency components and mitigate spectral bias, along with jointly optimized, spatially-adaptive masks that localize neuron influence, reducing network redundancy and improving convergence stability. Robust to hyperparameter selection, SASNet faithfully reconstructs high-frequency signals without overfitting low-frequency regions. Our experiments show that SASNet outperforms state-of-the-art INRs, achieving strong fitting accuracy, super-resolution capability, and noise suppression, without sacrificing model compactness.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, supplementary materials</p></details> |

Currently, in the field of pig behavior recognition, the lack of publicly available behavioral datasets not only limits the development of innovative algorithms but also hampers model robustness and algorithm optimization.This paper proposes a dataset containing 13 pig behaviors that significantly impact welfare.Based on this dataset, this paper proposes a spatial-temporal perception and enhancement networks based on the attention mechanism to model the spatiotemporal features of pig behaviors and their associated interaction areas in video data. The network is composed of a spatiotemporal perception network and a spatiotemporal feature enhancement network. The spatiotemporal perception network is responsible for establishing connections between the pigs and the key regions of their behaviors in the video data. The spatiotemporal feature enhancement network further strengthens the important spatial features of individual pigs and captures the long-term dependencies of the spatiotemporal features of individual behaviors by remodeling these connections, thereby enhancing the model's perception of spatiotemporal changes in pig behaviors. Experimental results demonstrate that on the dataset established in this paper, our proposed model achieves a MAP score of 75.92%, which is an 8.17% improvement over the best-performing traditional model. This study not only improces the accuracy and generalizability of individual pig behavior recognition but also provides new technological tools for modern smart farming. The dataset and related code will be made publicly available alongside this paper.</p></details> |  |

A key theme in existing GCD approaches is adapting large-scale pre-trained models for the GCD task. An alternate perspective, however, is to adapt the data representation itself for better alignment with the pre-trained model. As such, in this paper, we introduce a two-stage adaptation approach termed SPTNet, which iteratively optimizes model parameters (i.e., model-finetuning) and data parameters (i.e., prompt learning). Furthermore, we propose a novel spatial prompt tuning method (SPT) which considers the spatial property of image data, enabling the method to better focus on object parts, which can transfer between seen and unseen classes. We thoroughly evaluate our SPTNet on standard benchmarks and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing GCD methods. Notably, we find our method achieves an average accuracy of 61.4% on the SSB, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods by approximately 10%. The improvement is particularly remarkable as our method yields extra parameters amounting to only 0.117% of those in the backbone architecture.

One of the major challenges in R2R flexible electronics printing is achieving tight alignment tolerances, as specified by the device resolution (usually at the micro-meter level), for multi-layer printed electronics. The alignment of the printed patterns in different layers is known as registration. Conventional registration control methods rely on real-time feedback controllers, such as PID control, to regulate the web tension and the web speed. However, those methods may lose effectiveness in compensating for recurring disturbances and supporting effective mitigation of registration errors. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Terminal Iterative Learning Control (STILC) method integrated with PID control to iteratively learn and reduce registration error cycle-by-cycle, converging it to zero. This approach enables unprecedented precision in the creation, integration, and manipulation of multi-layer microstructures in R2R processes. We theoretically prove the convergence of the proposed STILC-PID hybrid approach and validate its effectiveness through a simulated registration error scenario caused by axis mismatch between roller and motor, a common issue in R2R systems. The results demonstrate that the STILC-PID hybrid control method can fully eliminate the registration error after a feasible number of iterations. Additionally, we analyze the impact of different learning gains on the convergence performance of STILC.</p></details> |  |

While Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on neuromorphic hardware are often considered for energy-efficient and low latency event-based data processing, they often fall short of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in accuracy and flexibility. Here, we introduce Attention-based Hybrid SNN-ANN backbones for event-based object detection to leverage the strengths of both SNN and ANN architectures. A novel Attention-based SNN-ANN bridge module captures sparse spatial and temporal relations from the SNN layer and converts them into dense feature maps for the ANN part of the backbone. Additionally, we present a variant that integrates DWConvL-STMs to the ANN blocks to capture slower dynamics. This multi-timescale network combines fast SNN processing for short timesteps with long-term dense RNN processing, effectively capturing both fast and slow dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses SNN-based approaches by significant margins, with results comparable to existing ANN and RNN-based methods. Unlike ANN-only networks, the hybrid setup allows us to implement the SNN blocks on digital neuromorphic hardware to investigate the feasibility of our approach. Extensive ablation studies and implementation on neuromorphic hardware confirm the effectiveness of our proposed modules and architectural choices. Our hybrid SNN-ANN architectures pave the way for ANN-like performance at a drastically reduced parameter, latency, and power budget.</p></details> |  |

Combining Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) and massive Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) enhances spectral efficiency, power efficiency, and device connectivity. However, deploying MIMO-NOMA in dense networks poses challenges in managing interference and optimizing power allocation while ensuring that the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) meets required thresholds. Unlike previous studies that analyze user clustering and power allocation techniques under simplified assumptions, this work provides a comparative evaluation of multiple clustering and allocation strategies under identical spatially correlated network conditions. We focus on maximizing the number of served users under a given Quality of Service (QoS) constraint rather than the conventional sum-rate maximization approach. Additionally, we consider spatial correlation in user grouping, a factor often overlooked despite its importance in mitigating intra-cluster interference. We evaluate clustering algorithms, including user pairing, random clustering, Correlation Iterative Clustering Algorithm (CIA), K-means++-based User Clustering (KUC), and Grey Wolf Optimizer-based clustering (GWO), in a downlink spatially correlated MIMO-NOMA environment. Numerical results demonstrate that the GWO-based clustering algorithm achieves superior energy efficiency while maintaining scalability, whereas CIA effectively maximizes the number of served users. These findings provide valuable insights for designing MIMO-NOMA systems that optimize resource allocation in next-generation wireless networks.</p></details> |  |

Recent approaches mainly focus on employing image-level features to construct temporal dependencies and generate prototypes for each action category. However, a considerable number of these methods utilize mainly image-level features that incorporate background noise and focus insufficiently on real foreground (action-related instances), thereby compromising the recognition capability, particularly in the few-shot scenario. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel joint Image-Instance level Spatial-temporal attention approach (I2ST) for Few-shot Action Recognition. The core concept of I2ST is to perceive the action-related instances and integrate them with image features via spatial-temporal attention. Specifically, I2ST consists of two key components: Action-related Instance Perception and Joint Image-Instance Spatial-temporal Attention. Given the basic representations from the feature extractor, the Action-related Instance Perception is introduced to perceive action-related instances under the guidance of a text-guided segmentation model. Subsequently, the Joint Image-Instance Spatial-temporal Attention is used to construct the feature dependency between instances and images...</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Computer Vision and Image Understanding</p></details> |

To enhance learning efficiency, these methods often integrate fine-tuning or continual learning strategies. However, this compromises the model's prediction accuracy and the translation-based methods lack support for complex relational structures (multi-hop relations). To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel CKGE framework SoTCKGE grounded in Spatial Offset Transformation. Within this framework, entity positions are defined as being jointly determined by base position vectors and offset vectors. This not only enhances the model's ability to represent complex relational structures but also allows for the embedding update of both new and old knowledge through simple spatial offset transformations, without the need for continuous learning methods. Furthermore, we introduce a hierarchical update strategy and a balanced embedding method to refine the parameter update process, effectively minimizing training costs and augmenting model accuracy. To comprehensively assess the performance of our model, we have conducted extensive experimlents on four publicly accessible datasets and a new dataset constructed by us. Experimental results demonstrate the advantage of our model in enhancing multi-hop relationship learning and further improving prediction accuracy.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

Unlike previous approaches that process flattened local visual patches via direct discretization or adaptive query tokenization, SweetTok proposes a decoupling framework, compressing visual inputs through distinct spatial and temporal queries via \textbf{D}ecoupled \textbf{Q}uery \textbf{A}uto\textbf{E}ncoder (DQAE). This design allows SweetTok to efficiently compress video token count while achieving superior fidelity by capturing essential information across spatial and temporal dimensions. Furthermore, we design a \textbf{M}otion-enhanced \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{C}odebook (MLC) tailored for spatial and temporal compression to address the differences in semantic representation between appearance and motion information. SweetTok significantly improves video reconstruction results by \textbf{42.8\%} w.r.t rFVD on UCF-101 dataset. With a better token compression strategy, it also boosts downstream video generation results by \textbf{15.1\%} w.r.t gFVD. Additionally, the compressed decoupled tokens are imbued with semantic information, enabling few-shot recognition capabilities powered by LLMs in downstream applications.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods rely on fixed, predefined region boundaries, which fail to capture the dynamic and complex nature of real-world urban areas. In this paper, we propose the Boundary Prompting Urban Region Representation Framework (BPURF), a novel approach that allows for elastic urban region definitions. BPURF comprises two key components: (1) A spatial token dictionary, where urban entities are treated as tokens and integrated into a unified token graph, and (2) a region token set representation model which utilize token aggregation and a multi-channel model to embed token sets corresponding to region boundaries. Additionally, we propose fast token set extraction strategy to enable online token set extraction during training and prompting. This framework enables the definition of urban regions through boundary prompting, supporting varying region boundaries and adapting to different tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of BPURF in capturing the complex characteristics of urban regions.</p></details> |  |

We introduce two sequential generative models, VAE-RNN and VAE-Transformer, which transform first-person perspective (FPP) observations into global map perspective (GMP) representations and precise geographical coordinates. Unlike retrieval-based methods, our approach frames localization as a generative task, learning direct mappings between perspectives without relying on dense satellite image databases. We evaluate these models across two real-world environments: a university campus navigated by a Jackal robot and an urban downtown area navigated by a Tesla sedan. The VAE-Transformer achieves impressive precision, with median deviations of 2.29m (1.37% of environment size) and 4.45m (0.35% of environment size) respectively, outperforming both VAE-RNN and prior cross-view geo-localization approaches. Our comprehensive Localization Performance Characteristics (LPC) analysis demonstrates superior performance with the VAE-Transformer achieving an AUC of 0.777 compared to 0.295 for VIGOR 200 and 0.225 for TransGeo, establishing a new state-of-the-art in vision-based localization. In some scenarios, our vision-based system rivals commercial smartphone GPS accuracy (AUC of 0.797) while requiring 5x less GPU memory and delivering 3x faster inference than existing methods in cross-view geo-localization. These results demonstrate that models inspired by biological spatial navigation can effectively memorize complex, dynamic environments and provide precise localization with minimal computational resources.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

However, their proficiency in spatial reasoning remains limited, despite its crucial role in tasks involving navigation and interaction with physical environments. Specifically, most of these tasks rely on the core spatial reasoning capabilities in two-dimensional (2D) environments, and our evaluation reveals that state-of-the-art VLMs frequently generate implausible and incorrect responses to composite spatial reasoning problems, including simple pathfinding tasks that humans can solve effortlessly at a glance. To address this, we explore an effective approach to enhance 2D spatial reasoning within VLMs by training the model solely on basic spatial capabilities. We begin by disentangling the key components of 2D spatial reasoning: direction comprehension, distance estimation, and localization. Our central hypothesis is that mastering these basic spatial capabilities can significantly enhance a model's performance on composite spatial tasks requiring advanced spatial understanding and combinatorial problem-solving, with generalized improvements in real-world visual-spatial tasks. To investigate this hypothesis, we introduce Sparkle: a framework that uses synthetic data generation to provide targeted supervision for vision language models (VLMs) in three basic spatial capabilities, creating an instruction dataset for each capability. Our experiments demonstrate that VLMs fine-tuned with Sparkle achieve significant performance gains, not only in the basic tasks themselves but also in generalizing to composite and out-of-distribution real-world spatial reasoning tasks. These findings offer insights into systematic strategies for improving VLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

By combining minimal manual supervision with large-scale Visual Question-Answering (VQA) pairs auto-labeling, our approach tackles the challenge of VLMs' limited spatial understanding in social navigation tasks. By applying a hierarchical two-round VQA strategy during training, AutoSpatial achieves both global and detailed understanding of scenarios, demonstrating more accurate spatial perception, movement prediction, Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning, final action, and explanation compared to other SOTA approaches. These five components are essential for comprehensive social navigation reasoning. Our approach was evaluated using both expert systems (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) that provided cross-validation scores and human evaluators who assigned relative rankings to compare model performances across four key aspects. Augmented by the enhanced spatial reasoning capabilities, AutoSpatial demonstrates substantial improvements by averaged cross-validation score from expert systems in: perception & prediction (up to 10.71%), reasoning (up to 16.26%), action (up to 20.50%), and explanation (up to 18.73%) compared to baseline models trained only on manually annotated data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Look Inside for More: Internal Spatial Modality Perception for 3D Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13461v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D anomaly detection has recently become a significant focus in computer vision. Several advanced methods have achieved satisfying anomaly detection performance. However, they typically concentrate on the external structure of 3D samples and struggle to leverage the internal information embedded within samples. Inspired by the basic intuition of why not look inside for more, we introduce a straightforward method named Internal Spatial Modality Perception~(ISMP) to explore the feature representation from internal views fully. Specifically, our proposed ISMP consists of a critical perception module, Spatial Insight Engine~(SIE), which abstracts complex internal information of point clouds into essential global features. Besides, to better align structural information with point data, we propose an enhanced key point feature extraction module for amplifying spatial structure feature representation. Simultaneously, a novel feature filtering module is incorporated to reduce noise and redundant features for further aligning precise spatial structure. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving object-level and pixel-level AUROC improvements of 3.2\% and 13.1\%, respectively, on the Real3D-AD benchmarks. Note that the strong generalization ability of SIE has been theoretically proven and is verified in both classification and segmentation tasks.</p></details> | AAAI2025 Poster |
| **[Towards Spatial Transcriptomics-guided Pathological Image Recognition with Batch-Agnostic Encoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07173v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is a novel technique that simultaneously captures pathological images and gene expression profiling with spatial coordinates. Since ST is closely related to pathological features such as disease subtypes, it may be valuable to augment image representation with pathological information. However, there are no attempts to leverage ST for image recognition ({\it i.e,} patch-level classification of subtypes of pathological image.). One of the big challenges is significant batch effects in spatial transcriptomics that make it difficult to extract pathological features of images from ST. In this paper, we propose a batch-agnostic contrastive learning framework that can extract consistent signals from gene expression of ST in multiple patients. To extract consistent signals from ST, we utilize the batch-agnostic gene encoder that is trained in a variational inference manner. Experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of our framework on a publicly available dataset.

As forest management and conservation needs become increasingly complex, NFIs are being called upon to provide forest parameter estimates at spatial scales smaller than current design-based estimation procedures can provide. This is particularly true when estimates are desired by species or species groups. Here we propose a multivariate spatial model for small area estimation of species-specific forest inventory parameters. The hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework accounts for key complexities in species-specific forest inventory data, such as zero-inflation, correlations among species, and residual spatial autocorrelation. Importantly, by fitting the model directly to the individual plot-level data, the framework enables estimates of species-level forest parameters, with associated uncertainty, across any user-defined small area of interest. A simulation study revealed minimal bias and higher accuracy of the proposed model-based approach compared to the design-based estimator and a non-parametric k-nearest neighbor (kNN) estimator. We applied the model to estimate species-specific county-level aboveground biomass for the 20 most abundant tree species in the southern United States using Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data. Biomass estimates from the proposed model had high correlations with design-based estimates and kNN estimates. Importantly, the proposed model provided large gains in precision across all 20 species. On average across species, 91.5% of county-level biomass estimates had higher precision compared to the design-based estimates. The proposed framework improves the ability of NFI data users to generate species-level forest parameter estimates with reasonable precision at management-relevant spatial scales.</p></details> | 35 pages, 6 figures |

Existing approaches often rely on simple spatiotemporal stacking, which introduces feature redundancy, while subtle joint-level details remain overlooked from a spatial perspective. To this end, we propose a novel HiSTF Mamba framework. The framework is composed of three key modules: Dual-Spatial Mamba, Bi-Temporal Mamba, and Dynamic Spatiotemporal Fusion Module (DSFM). Dual-Spatial Mamba incorporates ``Part-based + Whole-based'' parallel modeling to represent both whole-body coordination and fine-grained joint dynamics. Bi-Temporal Mamba adopts a bidirectional scanning strategy, effectively encoding short-term motion details and long-term dependencies. DSFM further performs redundancy removal and extraction of complementary information for temporal features, then fuses them with spatial features, yielding an expressive spatio-temporal representation. Experimental results on the HumanML3D dataset demonstrate that HiSTF Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics. In particular, it reduces the FID score from 0.283 to 0.189, a relative decrease of nearly 30%. These findings validate the effectiveness of HiSTF Mamba in achieving high fidelity and strong semantic alignment in text-to-motion generation.</p></details> | 11pages,3figures, |
| **[A2I-Calib: An Anti-noise Active Multi-IMU Spatial-temporal Calibration Framework for Legged Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06844v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, multi-node inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based odometry for legged robots has gained attention due to its cost-effectiveness, power efficiency, and high accuracy. However, the spatial and temporal misalignment between foot-end motion derived from forward kinematics and foot IMU measurements can introduce inconsistent constraints, resulting in odometry drift. Therefore, accurate spatial-temporal calibration is crucial for the multi-IMU systems. Although existing multi-IMU calibration methods have addressed passive single-rigid-body sensor calibration, they are inadequate for legged systems. This is due to the insufficient excitation from traditional gaits for calibration, and enlarged sensitivity to IMU noise during kinematic chain transformations. To address these challenges, we propose A$^2$I-Calib, an anti-noise active multi-IMU calibration framework enabling autonomous spatial-temporal calibration for arbitrary foot-mounted IMUs. Our A$^2$I-Calib includes: 1) an anti-noise trajectory generator leveraging a proposed basis function selection theorem to minimize the condition number in correlation analysis, thus reducing noise sensitivity, and 2) a reinforcement learning (RL)-based controller that ensures robust execution of calibration motions. Furthermore, A$^2$I-Calib is validated on simulation and real-world quadruped robot platforms with various multi-IMU settings, which demonstrates a significant reduction in noise sensitivity and calibration errors, thereby improving the overall multi-IMU odometry performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Highly Multivariate Large-scale Spatial Stochastic Processes -- A Cross-Markov Random Field Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10396v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Key challenges in the analysis of highly multivariate large-scale spatial stochastic processes, where both the number of components (p) and spatial locations (n) can be large, include achieving maximal sparsity in the joint precision matrix, ensuring efficient computational cost for its generation, accommodating asymmetric cross-covariance in the joint covariance matrix, and delivering scientific interpretability. We propose a cross-MRF model class, consisting of a mixed spatial graphical model framework and cross-MRF theory, to collectively address these challenges in one unified framework across two modelling stages. The first stage exploits scientifically informed conditional independence (CI) among p component fields and allows for a step-wise parallel generation of joint covariance and precision matrix, enabling a simultaneous accommodation of asymmetric cross-covariance in joint covariance matrix and sparsity in joint precision matrix. The second stage extends the first-stage CI to doubly CI among both p and n and unearths the cross-MRF via an extended Hammersley-Clifford theorem for multivariate spatial stochastic processes. This results in the sparsest possible representation of the joint precision matrix and ensures its lowest generation complexity. We demonstrate with 1D simulated comparative studies and 2D real-world data.</p></details> | 54 pages; 10 figures |

In this work, we present a RAB technique to address covariance matrix reconstruction problems. The proposed method involves IPNC matrix reconstruction using a low-complexity spatial sampling process (LCSSP) and employs a virtual received array vector. In particular, we devise a power spectrum sampling strategy based on a projection matrix computed in a higher dimension. A key feature of the proposed LCSSP technique is to avoid reconstruction of the IPNC matrix by integrating over the angular sector of the interference-plus-noise region. Simulation results are shown and discussed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed LCSSP method against existing approaches.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

Existing topological segmentation loss functions are primarily based on the persistent homology of the image. They match the persistent features from the segmentation with the persistent features from the ground truth and minimize the difference between them. However, these methods suffer from an ambiguous matching problem since the matching only relies on the information in the topological space. In this work, we propose an effective and efficient Spatial-Aware Topological Loss Function that further leverages the information in the original spatial domain of the image to assist the matching of persistent features. Extensive experiments on images of various types of tubular structures show that the proposed method has superior performance in improving the topological accuracy of the segmentation compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Ambiguity-Free Spatial Foundation Model: Rethinking and Decoupling Depth Ambiguity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06014v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Depth ambiguity is a fundamental challenge in spatial scene understanding, especially in transparent scenes where single-depth estimates fail to capture full 3D structure. Existing models, limited to deterministic predictions, overlook real-world multi-layer depth. To address this, we introduce a paradigm shift from single-prediction to multi-hypothesis spatial foundation models. We first present \texttt{MD-3k}, a benchmark exposing depth biases in expert and foundational models through multi-layer spatial relationship labels and new metrics. To resolve depth ambiguity, we propose Laplacian Visual Prompting (LVP), a training-free spectral prompting technique that extracts hidden depth from pre-trained models via Laplacian-transformed RGB inputs. By integrating LVP-inferred depth with standard RGB-based estimates, our approach elicits multi-layer depth without model retraining. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of LVP in zero-shot multi-layer depth estimation, unlocking more robust and comprehensive geometry-conditioned visual generation, 3D-grounded spatial reasoning, and temporally consistent video-level depth inference. Our benchmark and code will be available at https://github.com/Xiaohao-Xu/Ambiguity-in-Space.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 31 figures, github repo: https://github.com/Xiaohao-Xu/Ambiguity-in-Space</p></details> |
| **[GestureLSM: Latent Shortcut based Co-Speech Gesture Generation with Spatial-Temporal Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18898v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating full-body human gestures based on speech signals remains challenges on quality and speed. Existing approaches model different body regions such as body, legs and hands separately, which fail to capture the spatial interactions between them and result in unnatural and disjointed movements. Additionally, their autoregressive/diffusion-based pipelines show slow generation speed due to dozens of inference steps. To address these two challenges, we propose GestureLSM, a flow-matching-based approach for Co-Speech Gesture Generation with spatial-temporal modeling. Our method i) explicitly model the interaction of tokenized body regions through spatial and temporal attention, for generating coherent full-body gestures. ii) introduce the flow matching to enable more efficient sampling by explicitly modeling the latent velocity space. To overcome the suboptimal performance of flow matching baseline, we propose latent shortcut learning and beta distribution time stamp sampling during training to enhance gesture synthesis quality and accelerate inference. Combining the spatial-temporal modeling and improved flow matching-based framework, GestureLSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on BEAT2 while significantly reducing inference time compared to existing methods, highlighting its potential for enhancing digital humans and embodied agents in real-world applications.

Recent computational advancements allow efficient, relatively simple, and quick approximate Bayesian estimation for MRP. As population health outcomes of interest including vaccination uptake are known to have spatial structure, precision may be gained by including space in the model. We test a recently proposed spatial MRP method that includes a BYM2 spatial term that smooths across demographics and geographic areas using a large, unrepresentative survey. We produce California county-level estimates of first-dose COVID-19 vaccination up to June 2021 using classic and spatial MRP models, and poststratify using data from the American Community Survey (US Census Bureau). We assess validity using reported first-dose vaccination counts from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Neither classic nor spatial MRP models performed well, highlighting: 1. spatial MRP may be most appropriate for richer data contexts, 2. some demographics in the survey data are over-sampled and -aggregated, producing model over-smoothing, and 3. a need for survey producers to share user-representative metrics to better benchmark estimates.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages (12 main article + 33 pages of appendix), 3 figures.

For this reason, self-supervised image-only pretraining is still the go-to method for many dense vision applications (e.g. depth estimation, semantic segmentation), despite the lack of explicit supervisory signals. In this paper, we close this gap between image-text and self-supervised learning, by proposing a novel general-purpose image-text model, which can be effectively used off the shelf for dense and global vision tasks. Our method, which we refer to as Text-Image Pretraining with Spatial awareness (TIPS), leverages two simple and effective insights. First, on textual supervision: we reveal that replacing noisy web image captions by synthetically generated textual descriptions boosts dense understanding performance significantly, due to a much richer signal for learning spatially aware representations. We propose an adapted training method that combines noisy and synthetic captions, resulting in improvements across both dense and global understanding tasks. Second, on the learning technique: we propose to combine contrastive image-text learning with self-supervised masked image modeling, to encourage spatial coherence, unlocking substantial enhancements for downstream applications. Building on these two ideas, we scale our model using the transformer architecture, trained on a curated set of public images. Our experiments are conducted on 8 tasks involving 16 datasets in total, demonstrating strong off-the-shelf performance on both dense and global understanding, for several image-only and image-text tasks.

| **[Spatial regularisation for improved accuracy and interpretability in keypoint-based registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04499v2)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised registration strategies bypass requirements in ground truth transforms or segmentations by optimising similarity metrics between fixed and moved volumes. Among these methods, a recent subclass of approaches based on unsupervised keypoint detection stand out as very promising for interpretability. Specifically, these methods train a network to predict feature maps for fixed and moving images, from which explainable centres of mass are computed to obtain point clouds, that are then aligned in closed-form. However, the features returned by the network often yield spatially diffuse patterns that are hard to interpret, thus undermining the purpose of keypoint-based registration. Here, we propose a three-fold loss to regularise the spatial distribution of the features. First, we use the KL divergence to model features as point spread functions that we interpret as probabilistic keypoints. Then, we sharpen the spatial distributions of these features to increase the precision of the detected landmarks. Finally, we introduce a new repulsive loss across keypoints to encourage spatial diversity. Overall, our loss considerably improves the interpretability of the features, which now correspond to precise and anatomically meaningful landmarks. We demonstrate our three-fold loss in foetal rigid motion tracking and brain MRI affine registration tasks, where it not only outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised strategies, but also bridges the gap with state-of-the-art supervised methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/BenBillot/spatial_regularisation.</p></details> | under review |

However, decoding EEG signals across different headsets remains a significant challenge due to differences in the number and locations of the electrodes. To address this challenge, we propose a spatial distillation based distribution alignment (SDDA) approach for heterogeneous cross-headset transfer in non-invasive BCIs. SDDA uses first spatial distillation to make use of the full set of electrodes, and then input/feature/output space distribution alignments to cope with the significant differences between the source and target domains. To our knowledge, this is the first work to use knowledge distillation in cross-headset transfers. Extensive experiments on six EEG datasets from two BCI paradigms demonstrated that SDDA achieved superior performance in both offline unsupervised domain adaptation and online supervised domain adaptation scenarios, consistently outperforming 10 classical and state-of-the-art transfer learning algorithms.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

Specifically, we introduce Ego3D Position Encoding to inject 3D information into the input observations of the visual-language-action model, and propose Adaptive Action Grids to represent spatial robot movement actions with adaptive discretized action grids, facilitating learning generalizable and transferrable spatial action knowledge for cross-robot control. SpatialVLA is first pre-trained on top of a vision-language model with 1.1 Million real-world robot episodes, to learn a generalist manipulation policy across multiple robot environments and tasks. After pre-training, SpatialVLA is directly applied to perform numerous tasks in a zero-shot manner. The superior results in both simulation and real-world robots demonstrate its advantage of inferring complex robot motion trajectories and its strong in-domain multi-task generalization ability. We further show the proposed Adaptive Action Grids offer a new and effective way to fine-tune the pre-trained SpatialVLA model for new simulation and real-world setups, where the pre-learned action grids are re-discretized to capture robot-specific spatial action movements of new setups. The superior results from extensive evaluations demonstrate the exceptional in-distribution generalization and out-of-distribution adaptation capability, highlighting the crucial benefit of the proposed spatial-aware representations for generalist robot policy learning. All the details and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |

To overcome the limitations that they often overlook spectral anomaly and rely on large-scale matrix singular value decomposition, we first apply non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to alleviate spectral dimensionality redundancy and extract spectral anomaly and then employ LRTR to extract spatial anomaly while mitigating spatial redundancy, yielding a highly efffcient layered tensor decomposition (LTD) framework for HAD. An iterative algorithm based on proximal alternating minimization is developed to solve the proposed LTD model, with convergence guarantees provided. Moreover, we introduce a rank reduction strategy with validation mechanism that adaptively reduces data size while preventing excessive reduction. Theoretically, we rigorously establish the equivalence between the tensor tubal rank and tensor group sparsity regularization (TGSR) and, under mild conditions, demonstrate that the relaxed formulation of TGSR shares the same global minimizers and optimal values as its original counterpart. Experimental results on the Airport-Beach-Urban and MVTec datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the HAD task.</p></details> |  |

Annotation-free methods, such as multiple instance learning (MIL) and self-supervised learning (SSL), have emerged to address this challenge; however, current SSL techniques often depend on synthetic augmentations or temporal context, which may not adequately capture the intricate spatial relationships inherent to histopathology. In this work, we introduce a novel spatial context-driven positive pair sampling strategy for SSL that leverages the natural coherence of adjacent patches in WSIs. By constructing biologically relevant positive pairs from spatially proximate patches, our approach harnesses inherent spatial coherence to enhance patch-level representations, ultimately boosting slide-level classification performance. Experiments on multiple datasets reveal that our strategy improves classification accuracy by 5\% to 10\% over the standard method, paving the way for more clinically relevant AI models in cancer diagnosis.

Conventional methods rely on permutation-free operations, such as summation or attention mechanisms, to capture spatial information. However, these approaches often incur high computational costs or disrupt the effective use of spatial information during intra- and inter-channel interactions, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we propose UniArray, a novel approach that abandons the conventional interleaving manner. UniArray consists of three key components: a virtual microphone estimation (VME) module, a feature extraction and fusion module, and a hierarchical dual-path separator. The VME ensures robust performance across arrays with varying channel numbers. The feature extraction and fusion module leverages a spectral feature extraction module and a spatial dictionary learning (SDL) module to extract and fuse frequency-bin-level features, allowing the separator to focus on using the fused features. The hierarchical dual-path separator models feature dependencies along the time and frequency axes while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results show that UniArray outperforms state-of-the-art methods in SI-SDRi, WB-PESQ, NB-PESQ, and STOI across both seen and unseen array geometries.</p></details> | 5 pages, Prepirnt |

However, these models do not fully capture the complexity of the language learning process of an infant when used in isolation. In this paper, we examine how a model of language acquisition for infants and young children can be constructed and adapted for use in a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCN), taking into account the different types of linguistic relationships that occur during child language learning. We introduce a novel approach for predicting child vocabulary acquisition, and evaluate the efficacy of such a model with respect to the different types of linguistic relationships that occur during language acquisition, resulting in insightful observations on model calibration and norm selection. An evaluation of this model found that the mean accuracy of models for predicting new words when using sensorimotor relationships (0.733) and semantic relationships (0.729) were found to be superior to that observed with a 2-layer Feed-forward neural network. Furthermore, the high recall for some relationships suggested that some relationships (e.g. visual) were superior in identifying a larger proportion of relevant words that a child should subsequently learn than others (such as auditory).</p></details> |  |

In the human language system, experimental studies have observed clusters for syntactic and semantic categories, but the mechanisms underlying this functional organization remain unclear. Here, building on work from the vision literature, we develop TopoLM, a transformer language model with an explicit two-dimensional spatial representation of model units. By combining a next-token prediction objective with a spatial smoothness loss, representations in this model assemble into clusters that correspond to semantically interpretable groupings of text and closely match the functional organization in the brain's language system. TopoLM successfully predicts the emergence of the spatio-functional organization of a cortical language system as well as the organization of functional clusters selective for fine-grained linguistic features empirically observed in human cortex. Our results suggest that the functional organization of the human language system is driven by a unified spatial objective, and provide a functionally and spatially aligned model of language processing in the brain.</p></details> |  |

However, they struggle to perform spatio-temporal video grounding. This limitation stems from two major challenges. Firstly, it is difficult to extract accurate spatio-temporal information of each frame in the video. Secondly, the substantial number of visual tokens makes it challenging to precisely map visual tokens of each frame to their corresponding spatial coordinates. To address these issues, we introduce SpaceVLLM, a MLLM endowed with spatio-temporal video grounding capability. Specifically, we adopt a set of interleaved Spatio-Temporal Aware Queries to capture temporal perception and dynamic spatial information. Moreover, we propose a Query-Guided Space Decoder to establish a corresponding connection between the queries and spatial coordinates. Additionally, due to the lack of spatio-temporal datasets, we construct the Unified Spatio-Temporal Grounding (Uni-STG) dataset, comprising 480K instances across three tasks. This dataset fully exploits the potential of MLLM to simultaneously facilitate localization in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpaceVLLM achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 11 benchmarks covering temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal and video understanding tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Our code, datasets and model will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Distortion Aware Omnidirectional Video Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11506v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omnidirectional video (ODV) provides an immersive visual experience and is widely utilized in virtual reality and augmented reality. However, restricted capturing devices and transmission bandwidth lead to low-resolution ODVs. Video super-resolution (SR) is proposed to enhance resolution, but practical ODV spatial projection distortions and temporal flickering are not well addressed directly applying existing methods. To achieve better ODV-SR reconstruction, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Distortion Aware Network (STDAN) oriented to ODV characteristics. Specifically, a spatially continuous distortion modulation module is introduced to improve discrete projection distortions. Next, we design an interlaced multi-frame reconstruction mechanism to refine temporal consistency across frames. Furthermore, we incorporate latitude-saliency adaptive weights during training to concentrate on regions with higher texture complexity and human-watching interest.

| **[Human-Centric Video Anomaly Detection Through Spatio-Temporal Pose Tokenization and Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15185v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) presents a significant challenge in computer vision, particularly due to the unpredictable and infrequent nature of anomalous events, coupled with the diverse and dynamic environments in which they occur. Human-centric VAD, a specialized area within this domain, faces additional complexities, including variations in human behavior, potential biases in data, and substantial privacy concerns related to human subjects. These issues complicate the development of models that are both robust and generalizable. To address these challenges, recent advancements have focused on pose-based VAD, which leverages human pose as a high-level feature to mitigate privacy concerns, reduce appearance biases, and minimize background interference. In this paper, we introduce SPARTA, a novel transformer-based architecture designed specifically for human-centric pose-based VAD. SPARTA introduces an innovative Spatio-Temporal Pose and Relative Pose (ST-PRP) tokenization method that produces an enriched representation of human motion over time. This approach ensures that the transformer's attention mechanism captures both spatial and temporal patterns simultaneously, rather than focusing on only one aspect. The addition of the relative pose further emphasizes subtle deviations from normal human movements. The architecture's core, a novel Unified Encoder Twin Decoders (UETD) transformer, significantly improves the detection of anomalous behaviors in video data. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPARTA consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in pose-based VAD.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches, including spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks (ST-GCNs), often face high memory demands and struggle to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies, limiting their efficiency in clinical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce DynSTG-Mamba (Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Graph Mamba), a novel framework that combines DF-STGNN and STG-Mamba to enhance motion sequence modeling. The DF-STGNN incorporates a dynamic spatio-temporal filter that adaptively adjusts spatial connections between skeletal joints and temporal interactions across different movement phases. This approach ensures better feature propagation through dynamic graph structures by considering the hierarchical nature and dynamics of skeletal gait data. Meanwhile, STG-Mamba, an extension of Mamba adapted for skeletal motion data, ensures a continuous propagation of states, facilitating the capture of long-term dependencies while reducing computational complexity. To reduce the number of model parameters and computational costs while maintaining consistency, we propose Cross-Graph Relational Knowledge Distillation, a novel knowledge transfer mechanism that aligns relational information between teacher (large architecture) and student models (small architecture) while using shared memory. This ensures that the interactions and movement patterns of the joints are accurately preserved in the motion sequences. We validate our DynSTG-Mamba on KOA-NM, PD-WALK, and ATAXIA datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by achieving in terms of Accuracy, F1-score, and Recall. Our results highlight the efficiency and robustness of our approach, offering a lightweight yet highly accurate solution for automated gait analysis and movement disorder assessment.</p></details> |  |

Our approach applies query-based detection (DETR) to each frame and matches DETR queries to link the same person across frames. We introduce the Query Matching Module (QMM), which uses metric learning to bring queries for the same person closer together across frames compared to queries for different people. Action classes are predicted using the sequence of queries obtained from QMM matching, allowing for variable-length inputs from videos longer than a single clip. Experimental results on JHMDB, UCF101-24, and AVA datasets demonstrate that our method performs well for large position changes of people while offering superior computational efficiency and lower resource requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>exten...</summary><p>extended version of VISAPP2025</p></details> |

Recently, we have witnessed the rise of variational autoencoder-based latent factor models, which learn latent factors self-adaptively. While these models focus on modeling overall market conditions, they often fail to effectively capture the temporal patterns of individual stocks. Additionally, representing multiple factors as single values simplifies the model but limits its ability to capture complex relationships and dependencies. As a result, the learned factors are of low quality and lack diversity, reducing their effectiveness and robustness across different trading periods. To address these issues, we propose a Spatio-Temporal factOR Model based on dual vector quantized variational autoencoders, named STORM, which extracts features of stocks from temporal and spatial perspectives, then fuses and aligns these features at the fine-grained and semantic level, and represents the factors as multi-dimensional embeddings. The discrete codebooks cluster similar factor embeddings, ensuring orthogonality and diversity, which helps distinguish between different factors and enables factor selection in financial trading. To show the performance of the proposed factor model, we apply it to two downstream experiments: portfolio management on two stock datasets and individual trading tasks on six specific stocks. The extensive experiments demonstrate STORM's flexibility in adapting to downstream tasks and superior performance over baseline models.</p></details> |  |

It is a multimodal task aimed at localizing specific subjects spatio-temporally based on textual queries without bounding box supervision. Motivated by recent advancements in multi-modal foundation models for grounding tasks, we first explore the potential of state-of-the-art object detection models for WSTVG. Despite their robust zero-shot capabilities, our adaptation reveals significant limitations, including inconsistent temporal predictions, inadequate understanding of complex queries, and challenges in adapting to difficult scenarios. We propose CoSPaL (Contextual Self-Paced Learning), a novel approach which is designed to overcome these limitations. CoSPaL integrates three core components: (1) Tubelet Phrase Grounding (TPG), which introduces spatio-temporal prediction by linking textual queries to tubelets; (2) Contextual Referral Grounding (CRG), which improves comprehension of complex queries by extracting contextual information to refine object identification over time; and (3) Self-Paced Scene Understanding (SPS), a training paradigm that progressively increases task difficulty, enabling the model to adapt to complex scenarios by transitioning from coarse to fine-grained understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR'...</summary><p>ICLR'25 Main Conference.

Such data occurs widely, ranging from the scientific and medical domains to the industrial and environmental domains. When the properties in time series exhibit spatial variations, we often call the data spatio-temporal. As part of the continued digitalization of processes throughout society, increasingly large volumes of time series and spatio-temporal data are available. In this tutorial, we focus on data-driven decision making with such data, e.g., enabling greener and more efficient transportation based on traffic time series forecasting. The tutorial adopts the holistic paradigm of "data-governance-analytics-decision." We first introduce the data foundation of time series and spatio-temporal data, which is often heterogeneous. Next, we discuss data governance methods that aim to improve data quality. We then cover data analytics, focusing on five desired characteristics: automation, robustness, generality, explainability, and resource efficiency. We finally cover data-driven decision making strategies and briefly discuss promising research directions. We hope that the tutorial will serve as a primary resource for researchers and practitioners who are interested in value creation from time series and spatio-temporal data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ICDE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-temporal Fourier Transformer (StFT) for Long-term Dynamics Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11899v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating the long-term dynamics of multi-scale and multi-physics systems poses a significant challenge in understanding complex phenomena across science and engineering. The complexity arises from the intricate interactions between scales and the interplay of diverse physical processes. Neural operators have emerged as promising models for predicting such dynamics due to their flexibility and computational efficiency. However, they often fail to effectively capture multi-scale interactions or quantify the uncertainties inherent in the predictions. These limitations lead to rapid error accumulation, particularly in long-term forecasting of systems characterized by complex and coupled dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a spatio-temporal Fourier transformer (StFT), in which each transformer block is designed to learn dynamics at a specific scale. By leveraging a structured hierarchy of StFT blocks, the model explicitly captures dynamics across both macro- and micro- spatial scales. Furthermore, a generative residual correction mechanism is integrated to estimate and mitigate predictive uncertainties, enhancing both the accuracy and reliability of long-term forecasts. Evaluations conducted on three benchmark datasets (plasma, fluid, and atmospheric dynamics) demonstrate the advantages of our approach over state-of-the-art ML methods.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

However, can Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) also "reason through a sequential spatio-temporal logic" in videos? Existing Video-LLM benchmarks primarily focus on assessing object presence, neglecting relational reasoning. Consequently, it is difficult to measure whether a model truly comprehends object interactions (actions/events) in videos or merely relies on pre-trained "memory" of co-occurrences as biases in generating answers. In this work, we introduce a Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (V-STaR) benchmark to address these shortcomings. The key idea is to decompose video understanding into a Reverse Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (RSTR) task that simultaneously evaluates what objects are present, when events occur, and where they are located while capturing the underlying Chain-of-thought (CoT) logic. To support this evaluation, we construct a dataset to elicit the spatial-temporal reasoning process of Video-LLMs. It contains coarse-to-fine CoT questions generated by a semi-automated GPT-4-powered pipeline, embedding explicit reasoning chains to mimic human cognition. Experiments from 14 Video-LLMs on our V-STaR reveal significant gaps between current Video-LLMs and the needs for robust and consistent spatio-temporal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>A ben...</summary><p>A benchmark for Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning</p></details> |

Nevertheless, conventional Mamba-based models encounter significant challenges in accurately predicting stock time series, as they fail to adequately capture both the overarching market dynamics and the intricate interdependencies among individual stocks. To overcome these constraints, we introduce the Hierarchical Information-Guided Spatio-Temporal Mamba (HIGSTM) framework. HIGSTM introduces Index-Guided Frequency Filtering Decomposition to extract commonality and specificity from time series. The model architecture features a meticulously designed hierarchical framework that systematically captures both temporal dynamic patterns and global static relationships within the stock market. Furthermore, we propose an Information-Guided Mamba that integrates macro informations into the sequence selection process, thereby facilitating more market-conscious decision-making. Comprehensive experimental evaluations conducted on the CSI500, CSI800 and CSI1000 datasets demonstrate that HIGSTM achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods struggle with low signal-to-noise ratios and single-station reliance, limiting their effectiveness. We propose a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) using Spectral Structure Learning Convolution (Spectral SLC) to model static and dynamic relationships across seismic stations. Our approach processes multi-station waveform data and generates station-specific detection probabilities. Experiments show superior performance over a conventional GCN baseline in terms of true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR), highlighting its potential for robust multi-station earthquake detection.

Prior work primarily focuses on single-frame cooperative perception, which fuses agents' information across different spatial locations but ignores temporal cues and temporal tasks (e.g., temporal perception and prediction). In this paper, we focus on the spatio-temporal fusion in V2X scenarios and design one-step and multi-step communication strategies (when to transmit) as well as examine their integration with three fusion strategies - early, late, and intermediate (what to transmit), providing comprehensive benchmarks with 11 fusion models (how to fuse). Furthermore, we propose V2XPnP, a novel intermediate fusion framework within one-step communication for end-to-end perception and prediction. Our framework employs a unified Transformer-based architecture to effectively model complex spatio-temporal relationships across multiple agents, frames, and high-definition map. Moreover, we introduce the V2XPnP Sequential Dataset that supports all V2X collaboration modes and addresses the limitations of existing real-world datasets, which are restricted to single-frame or single-mode cooperation. Extensive experiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both perception and prediction tasks.

Compared to classic STVG locating only a single target, OmniSTVG enables localization of not only an arbitrary number of text-referred targets but also their interacting counterparts in the query from the video, making it more flexible and practical in real scenarios for comprehensive understanding. In order to facilitate exploration of OmniSTVG, we introduce BOSTVG, a large-scale benchmark dedicated to OmniSTVG. Specifically, our BOSTVG consists of 10,018 videos with 10.2M frames and covers a wide selection of 287 classes from diverse scenarios. Each sequence in BOSTVG, paired with a free-form textual query, encompasses a varying number of targets ranging from 1 to 10. To ensure high quality, each video is manually annotated with meticulous inspection and refinement. To our best knowledge, BOSTVG is to date the first and the largest benchmark for OmniSTVG. To encourage future research, we introduce a simple yet effective approach, named OmniTube, which, drawing inspiration from Transformer-based STVG methods, is specially designed for OmniSTVG and demonstrates promising results. By releasing BOSTVG, we hope to go beyond classic STVG by locating every object appearing in the query for more comprehensive understanding, opening up a new direction for STVG. Our benchmark, model, and results will be released at https://github.com/JellyYao3000/OmniSTVG.</p></details> |  |

Traditional deep learning approaches have significantly advanced this field, particularly in the stage of ST data mining. However, these models remain task-specific and often require extensive labeled data. Inspired by the success of Foundation Models (FM), especially large language models, researchers have begun exploring the concept of Spatio-Temporal Foundation Models (STFMs) to enhance adaptability and generalization across diverse ST tasks. Unlike prior architectures, STFMs empower the entire workflow of ST data science, ranging from data sensing, management, to mining, thereby offering a more holistic and scalable approach. Despite rapid progress, a systematic study of STFMs for ST data science remains lacking. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive review of STFMs, categorizing existing methodologies and identifying key research directions to advance ST general intelligence.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing existing observations, spatio-temporal kriging is a method for estimating air quality at unobserved locations during a specific period. Inductive spatio-temporal kriging with increment training strategy has demonstrated its effectiveness using virtual nodes to simulate unobserved nodes. However, a disparity between virtual and real nodes persists, complicating the application of learning patterns derived from virtual nodes to actual unobserved ones. To address these limitations, this paper presents a Physics-Guided Increment Training Strategy (PGITS). Specifically, we design a dynamic graph generation module to incorporate the advection and diffusion processes of airborne particles as physical knowledge into the graph structure, dynamically adjusting the adjacency matrix to reflect physical interactions between nodes. By using physics principles as a bridge between virtual and real nodes, this strategy ensures the features of virtual nodes and their pseudo labels are closer to actual nodes. Consequently, the learned patterns of virtual nodes can be applied to actual unobserved nodes for effective kriging.</p></details> |  |

Although GNNs have shown great promise in handling traffic datasets, their deployment in real-life applications has been hindered by scalability constraints arising from high-order message passing. Additionally, the over-smoothing problem of GNNs may lead to indistinguishable region representations as the number of layers increases, resulting in performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose a new knowledge distillation paradigm termed LightST that transfers spatial and temporal knowledge from a high-capacity teacher to a lightweight student. Specifically, we introduce a spatio-temporal knowledge distillation framework that helps student MLPs capture graph-structured global spatio-temporal patterns while alleviating the over-smoothing effect with adaptive knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments verify that LightST significantly speeds up traffic flow predictions by 5X to 40X compared to state-of-the-art spatio-temporal GNNs, all while maintaining superior accuracy.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Due to the inherent uncertainty in vessel behavior, trajectory prediction systems must adopt a multimodal approach to accurately model potential future motion states. However, existing vessel trajectory prediction methods lack the ability to comprehensively model behavioral multi-modality. To better capture multimodal behavior in interactive scenarios, we propose modeling interactions as dynamic graphs, replacing traditional aggregation-based techniques that rely on vessel states. By leveraging the natural multimodal capabilities of diffusion models, we frame the trajectory prediction task as an inverse process of motion uncertainty diffusion, wherein uncertainties across potential navigational areas are progressively eliminated until the desired trajectories is produced. In summary, we pioneer the integration of Spatio-Temporal Graph (STG) with diffusion models in ship trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments on real Automatic Identification System (AIS) data validate the superiority of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been ACCEPTED as a FULL PAPER at DASFAA 2025</p></details> |

As systems like autonomous driving become increasingly popular, ensuring their safety has become more important than ever. Therefore, this paper focuses on how to quickly and effectively detect various anomalies in the aforementioned systems, with the goal of making them safer and more effective. Many detection systems have been developed with great success under spatial contexts; however, there is still significant room for improvement when it comes to temporal context. While there is substantial work regarding this task, there is minimal work done regarding the efficiency of models and their ability to be applied to scenarios that require real-time inference, i.e., autonomous driving where anomalies need to be detected the moment they are within view. To address this gap, we propose STEAD (Spatio-Temporal Efficient Anomaly Detection), whose backbone is developed using (2+1)D Convolutions and Performer Linear Attention, which ensures computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. When tested on the UCF-Crime benchmark, our base model achieves an AUC of 91.34%, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art, and our fast version achieves an AUC of 88.87%, while having 99.70% less parameters and outperforming the previous state-of-the-art as well.

In this work, a novel approach combining a transformer-based Swin-Unet architecture with seasonal synthesized spatio-temporal images has been employed to classify LC types using spatio-temporal features extracted from Sentinel-1 (S1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, organized into seasonal clusters. The study focuses on three distinct regions - Amazonia, Africa, and Siberia - and evaluates the model performance across diverse ecoregions within these areas. By utilizing seasonal feature sequences instead of dense temporal sequences, notable performance improvements have been achieved, especially in regions with temporal data gaps like Siberia, where S1 data distribution is uneven and non-uniform.

Recent studies have shown that SNNs suffer from severe overfitting, which limits their generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Temporal Reversal Regularization (TRR) to mitigate overfitting during training and facilitate generalization of SNNs. We exploit the inherent temporal properties of SNNs to perform input/feature temporal reversal perturbations, prompting the SNN to produce original-reversed consistent outputs and learn perturbation-invariant representations. To further enhance generalization, we utilize the lightweight ``star operation" (Hadamard product) for feature hybridization of original and temporally reversed spike firing rates, which expands the implicit dimensionality and acts as a spatio-temporal regularizer. We show theoretically that our method is able to tighten the upper bound of the generalization error, and extensive experiments on static/neuromorphic recognition as well as 3D point cloud classification tasks demonstrate its effectiveness, versatility, and adversarial robustness. In particular, our regularization significantly improves the recognition accuracy of low-latency SNN for neuromorphic objects, contributing to the real-world deployment of neuromorphic computational software-hardware integration.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

However, existing methods still suffer from noisy and inconsistent flow matching, making it difficult to handle challenging scenarios and long-sequence estimation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Spatio-Temporal Visual Odometry (STVO), a novel deep network architecture that effectively leverages inherent spatio-temporal cues to enhance the accuracy and consistency of multi-frame flow matching. With more accurate and consistent flow matching, STVO can achieve better pose estimation through the bundle adjustment (BA). Specifically, STVO introduces two innovative components: 1) the Temporal Propagation Module that utilizes multi-frame information to extract and propagate temporal cues across adjacent frames, maintaining temporal consistency; 2) the Spatial Activation Module that utilizes geometric priors from the depth maps to enhance spatial consistency while filtering out excessive noise and incorrect matches. Our STVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on TUM-RGBD, EuRoc MAV, ETH3D and KITTI Odometry benchmarks. Notably, it improves accuracy by 77.8% on ETH3D benchmark and 38.9% on KITTI Odometry benchmark over the previous best methods.</p></details> |  |

A qualified generated video segment must ensure plot plausibility and coherence while maintaining visual consistency of objects and scenes across varying viewpoints. Prior research, especially in open-source projects, primarily focuses on either temporal or spatial consistency, or their basic combination, such as appending a description of a camera movement after a prompt without constraining the outcomes of this movement. However, camera movement may introduce new objects to the scene or eliminate existing ones, thereby overlaying and affecting the preceding narrative. Especially in videos with numerous camera movements, the interplay between multiple plots becomes increasingly complex. This paper introduces and examines integral spatio-temporal consistency, considering the synergy between plot progression and camera techniques, and the long-term impact of prior content on subsequent generation. Our research encompasses dataset construction through to the development of the model. Initially, we constructed a DropletVideo-10M dataset, which comprises 10 million videos featuring dynamic camera motion and object actions. Each video is annotated with an average caption of 206 words, detailing various camera movements and plot developments. Following this, we developed and trained the DropletVideo model, which excels in preserving spatio-temporal coherence during video generation. The DropletVideo dataset and model are accessible at https://dropletx.github.io.</p></details> |  |

However, understanding the predictions from a model is crucial to ensure reliability and trustworthiness, particularly for high-risk applications, such as healthcare and transport. Few existing methods are able to generate explanations for models trained on continuous-time dynamic graph data and, of these, the computational complexity and lack of suitable explanation objectives pose challenges. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{S}$patio-$\textbf{T}$emporal E$\textbf{X}$planation $\textbf{Search}$ (STX-Search), a novel method for generating instance-level explanations that is applicable to static and dynamic temporal graph structures. We introduce a novel search strategy and objective function, to find explanations that are highly faithful and interpretable.

Traditional approaches have relied on separate models tailored to either grid-based data, representing cities as uniform cells, or graph-based data, modeling cities as networks of nodes and edges. In this paper, we build UniFlow, a foundational model for general urban flow prediction that unifies both grid-based and graphbased data. We first design a multi-view spatio-temporal patching mechanism to standardize different data into a consistent sequential format and then introduce a spatio-temporal transformer architecture to capture complex correlations and dynamics. To leverage shared spatio-temporal patterns across different data types and facilitate effective cross-learning, we propose SpatioTemporal Memory Retrieval Augmentation (ST-MRA). By creating structured memory modules to store shared spatio-temporal patterns, ST-MRA enhances predictions through adaptive memory retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniFlow outperforms existing models in both grid-based and graph-based flow prediction, excelling particularly in scenarios with limited data availability, showcasing its superior performance and broad applicability.

In this paper, we demonstrate that effective information compression may occur over time or space during sequences of node communications in distributed algorithms, leading to the concept of spatio-temporal compressors. This abstraction classifies existing compressors as spatio-temporal compressors, with their effectiveness described by constructive stability criteria from nonlinear system theory. Subsequently, we apply these spatio-temporal compressors to standard continuous-time consensus flows and distributed prime-dual flows, establishing conditions ensuring convergence. Additionally, we introduce a novel observer-based distributed primal-dual continuous flow integrated with spatio-temporal compressors, which provides broader convergence conditions. These continuous flows achieve exponential convergence to the global optimum when the objective function is strongly convex and can be discretized using Euler approximations. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the versatility of the proposed spatio-temporal compressors and verify the convergence of algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2408.02332</p></details> |
| **[Transformer-Based Spatio-Temporal Association of Apple Fruitlets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03200v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a transformer-based method to spatio-temporally associate apple fruitlets in stereo-images collected on different days and from different camera poses. State-of-the-art association methods in agriculture are dedicated towards matching larger crops using either high-resolution point clouds or temporally stable features, which are both difficult to obtain for smaller fruit in the field. To address these challenges, we propose a transformer-based architecture that encodes the shape and position of each fruitlet, and propagates and refines these features through a series of transformer encoder layers with alternating self and cross-attention. We demonstrate that our method is able to achieve an F1-score of 92.4% on data collected in a commercial apple orchard and outperforms all baselines and ablations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Spatio-Temporal Processing in Spiking Neural Networks through Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07517v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Implementations of spiking neural networks on neuromorphic hardware promise orders of magnitude less power consumption than their non-spiking counterparts. The standard neuron model for spike-based computation on such systems has long been the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron. A computationally light augmentation of the LIF neuron model with an adaptation mechanism has recently been shown to exhibit superior performance on spatio-temporal processing tasks. The root of the superiority of these so-called adaptive LIF neurons however is not well understood. In this article, we thoroughly analyze the dynamical, computational, and learning properties of adaptive LIF neurons and networks thereof. Our investigation reveals significant challenges related to stability and parameterization when employing the conventional Euler-Forward discretization for this class of models. We report a rigorous theoretical and empirical demonstration that these challenges can be effectively addressed by adopting an alternative discretization approach - the Symplectic Euler method, allowing to improve over state-of-the-art performances on common event-based benchmark datasets. Our further analysis of the computational properties of networks of adaptive LIF neurons shows that they are particularly well suited to exploit the spatio-temporal structure of input sequences without any normalization techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian spatio-temporal modelling for infectious disease outbreak detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01456v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Bayesian analysis of infectious disease surveillance data from multiple locations typically involves building and fitting a spatio-temporal model of how the disease spreads in the structured population. Here we present new generally applicable methodology to perform this task. We introduce a parsimonious representation of seasonality and a biologically informed specification of the outbreak component to avoid parameter identifiability issues. We develop a computationally efficient Bayesian inference methodology for the proposed models, including techniques to detect outbreaks by computing marginal posterior probabilities at each spatial location and time point. We show that it is possible to efficiently integrate out the discrete parameters associated with outbreak states, enabling the use of dynamic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) as a complementary alternative to a hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Furthermore, we introduce a robust Bayesian model comparison framework based on importance sampling to approximate model evidence in high-dimensional space. The performance of our methodology is validated through systematic simulation studies, where simulated outbreaks were successfully detected, and our model comparison strategy demonstrates strong reliability. We also apply our new methodology to monthly incidence data on invasive meningococcal disease from 28 European countries. The results highlight outbreaks across multiple countries and months, with model comparison analysis showing that the new specification outperforms previous approaches. The accompanying software is freely available as a R package at https://github.com/Matthewadeoye/DetectOutbreaks.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this goal, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Memory Agent (STMA), a novel framework designed to enhance task planning and execution by integrating spatio-temporal memory. STMA is built upon three critical components: (1) a spatio-temporal memory module that captures historical and environmental changes in real time, (2) a dynamic knowledge graph that facilitates adaptive spatial reasoning, and (3) a planner-critic mechanism that iteratively refines task strategies. We evaluate STMA in the TextWorld environment on 32 tasks, involving multi-step planning and exploration under varying levels of complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that STMA achieves a 31.25% improvement in success rate and a 24.7% increase in average score compared to the state-of-the-art model. The results highlight the effectiveness of spatio-temporal memory in advancing the memory capabilities of embodied agents.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by recent advances in vision-language foundation models, we investigate their utility for WSTVG, leveraging their zero-shot grounding capabilities. However, we find that a simple adaptation lacks essential spatio-temporal grounding abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce Tubelet Referral Grounding (TRG), which connects textual queries to tubelets to enable spatio-temporal predictions. Despite its promise, TRG struggles with compositional action understanding and dense scene scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose STPro, a novel progressive learning framework with two key modules: (1) Sub-Action Temporal Curriculum Learning (SA-TCL), which incrementally builds compositional action understanding, and (2) Congestion-Guided Spatial Curriculum Learning (CG-SCL), which adapts the model to complex scenes by spatially increasing task difficulty. STPro achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets, with improvements of 1.0% on VidSTG-Declarative and 3.0% on HCSTVG-v1.</p></details> | CVPR'25 Conference |

To address this limitation, we explore automated pain detection using facial expressions. Our study leverages deep learning techniques to improve pain assessment by analyzing facial images from the Pain Emotion Faces Database (PEMF). We propose two novel approaches1: (1) a hybrid ConvNeXt model combined with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) blocks to analyze video frames and predict pain presence, and (2) a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution Network (STGCN) integrated with LSTM to process landmarks from facial images for pain detection. Our work represents the first use of the PEMF dataset for binary pain classification and demonstrates the effectiveness of these models through extensive experimentation. The results highlight the potential of combining spatial and temporal features for enhanced pain detection, offering a promising advancement in objective pain assessment methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables.

To address these limitations, this paper presents the Spatio-Temporal GraphFormer framework (STGFormer) for 3D human pose estimation in videos. First, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal criss-cross Graph (STG) attention mechanism, designed to more effectively leverage the inherent graph priors of the human body within continuous sequence distributions while capturing spatiotemporal long-range dependencies. Next, we present a dual-path Modulated Hop-wise Regular GCN (MHR-GCN) to independently process temporal and spatial dimensions in parallel, preserving features rich in temporal dynamics and the original or high-dimensional representations of spatial structures. Furthermore, the module leverages modulation to optimize parameter efficiency and incorporates spatiotemporal hop-wise skip connections to capture higher-order information. Finally, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPIINF-3DHP datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[H-FLTN: A Privacy-Preserving Hierarchical Framework for Electric Vehicle Spatio-Temporal Charge Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18697v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) poses critical challenges for energy providers, particularly in predicting charging time (temporal prediction), ensuring user privacy, and managing resources efficiently in mobility-driven networks. This paper introduces the Hierarchical Federated Learning Transformer Network (H-FLTN) framework to address these challenges. H-FLTN employs a three-tier hierarchical architecture comprising EVs, community Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems (DERMS), and the Energy Provider Data Centre (EPDC) to enable accurate spatio-temporal predictions of EV charging needs while preserving privacy. Temporal prediction is enhanced using Transformer-based learning, capturing complex dependencies in charging behavior. Privacy is ensured through Secure Aggregation, Additive Secret Sharing, and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Sharing with Augmentation, which allow only secret shares of model weights to be exchanged while securing all transmissions. To improve training efficiency and resource management, H-FLTN integrates Dynamic Client Capping Mechanism (DCCM) and Client Rotation Management (CRM), ensuring that training remains both computationally and temporally efficient as the number of participating EVs increases. DCCM optimises client participation by limiting excessive computational loads, while CRM balances training contributions across epochs, preventing imbalanced participation. Our simulation results based on large-scale empirical vehicle mobility data reveal that DCCM and CRM reduce the training time complexity with increasing EVs from linear to constant. Its integration into real-world smart city infrastructure enhances energy demand forecasting, resource allocation, and grid stability, ensuring reliability and sustainability in future mobility ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 tables, 2 figures, Journal Paper</p></details> |

Recently, advancements in monitoring technology have facilitated the effective recording of nuclear radiation levels and related factors, such as weather conditions. The abundance of monitoring data enables the development of accurate and reliable nuclear radiation forecasting models, which play a crucial role in informing decision-making for individuals and governments. However, this task is challenging due to the imbalanced distribution of monitoring stations over a wide spatial range and the non-stationary radiation variation patterns. In this study, we introduce NRFormer, a novel framework tailored for the nationwide prediction of nuclear radiation variations. By integrating a non-stationary temporal attention module, an imbalance-aware spatial attention module, and a radiation propagation prompting module, NRFormer collectively captures complex spatio-temporal dynamics of nuclear radiation. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework against 11 baselines.</p></details> |  |

The objective is to provide a quality score to ensure correct performance and achieve desired results. To achieve this goal, a new graph-based model, the Dense Spatio-Temporal Graph Conv-GRU Network with Transformer, is introduced. This model combines a modified version of STGCN and transformer architectures for efficient handling of spatio-temporal data. The key idea is to consider skeleton data respecting its non-linear structure as a graph and detecting joints playing the main role in each rehabilitation exercise. Dense connections and GRU mechanisms are used to rapidly process large 3D skeleton inputs and effectively model temporal dynamics. The transformer encoder's attention mechanism focuses on relevant parts of the input sequence, making it useful for evaluating rehabilitation exercises. The evaluation of our proposed approach on the KIMORE and UI-PRMD datasets highlighted its potential, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational time. This resulted in faster and more accurate learning and assessment of rehabilitation exercises. Additionally, our model provides valuable feedback through qualitative illustrations, effectively highlighting the significance of joints in specific exercises.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, Computers in Biology and Medicine Journal</p></details> |

However, traditional approaches to assess patient actions often rely on manual observation and scoring, which are subjective and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an automated approach for patient action assessment using a Multi-Residual Spatio Temporal Graph Network (MR-STGN) that incorporates both angular and positional 3D skeletons. The MR-STGN is specifically designed to capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of patient actions. It achieves this by integrating information from multiple residual layers, with each layer extracting features at distinct levels of abstraction. Furthermore, we integrate an attention fusion mechanism into the network, which facilitates the adaptive weighting of various features. This empowers the model to concentrate on the most pertinent aspects of the patient's movements, offering precise instructions regarding specific body parts or movements that require attention. Ablation studies are conducted to analyze the impact of individual components within the proposed model. We evaluate our model on the UI-PRMD dataset demonstrating its performance in accurately predicting real-time patient action scores, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, maintaining its adaptability under diverse object properties and complex working conditions remains challenging. This article highlights the importance of completely representing spatio-temporal features of slip, and proposes a novel approach for incipient slip modeling and detection. Based on the analysis of localized displacement phenomenon, we establish the relationship between the characteristic strain rate extreme events and the local slip state. This approach enables the detection of both the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of stick-slip regions. Also, the proposed method can be applied to strain distribution sensing devices, such as vision-based tactile sensors. Simulations and prototype experiments validated the effectiveness of this approach under varying contact conditions, including different contact geometries, friction coefficients, and combined loads. Experiments demonstrated that this method not only accurately and reliably delineates incipient slip, but also facilitates friction parameter estimation and adaptive grasping control.</p></details> | 21 pages, 19 figures |

However, most approaches are based on the assumption of the availability of and accessibility to a sufficiently dense data source, which is rather the rare case in reality. Traffic sensors in road networks are generally highly sparse in their distribution: fleet-based traffic sensing is sparse in space but also sparse in time. There are also other traffic application, besides road traffic, like moving objects in the marine space, where observations are sparsely and arbitrarily distributed in space. In this paper, we tackle the problem of traffic prediction on sparse and spatially irregular and non-deterministic traffic observations. We draw a border between imputations and this work as we consider high sparsity rates and no fixed sensor locations. We advance correlation mining methods with a Sparse Unstructured Spatio Temporal Reconstruction (SUSTeR) framework that reconstructs traffic states from sparse non-stationary observations. For the prediction the framework creates a hidden context traffic state which is enriched in a residual fashion with each observation. Such an assimilated hidden traffic state can be used by existing traffic prediction methods to predict future traffic states. We query these states with query locations from the spatial domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted and presented at ACM SIGSPATIAL '23</p></details> |

However, existing whole-body-object interaction video benchmarks overlook the truth that open-world objects are diverse, that is, they usually provide limited and predefined object classes. Therefore, we introduce a new open-world benchmark: Grounding Interacted Objects (GIO) including 1,098 interacted objects class and 290K interacted object boxes annotation. Accordingly, an object grounding task is proposed expecting vision systems to discover interacted objects. Even though today's detectors and grounding methods have succeeded greatly, they perform unsatisfactorily in localizing diverse and rare objects in GIO. This profoundly reveals the limitations of current vision systems and poses a great challenge. Thus, we explore leveraging spatio-temporal cues to address object grounding and propose a 4D question-answering framework (4D-QA) to discover interacted objects from diverse videos. Our method demonstrates significant superiority in extensive experiments compared to current baselines.

HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, which meet the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges, such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STAD) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which are then used as conditional inputs to direct the reverse denoising process. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the STAD significantly enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STAD demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks, indicating their potential to substantially boost the spatial resolution of EEG.</p></details> |  |

With around 2000 ball events per game, their precise and exhaustive annotation based on a monocular video stream remains a tedious and costly manual task. While state-of-the-art spatio-temporal action detection methods show promise for automating this task, they lack contextual understanding of the game. Assuming professional players' behaviors are interdependent, we hypothesize that incorporating surrounding players' information such as positions, velocity and team membership can enhance purely visual predictions. We propose a spatio-temporal action detection approach that combines visual and game state information via Graph Neural Networks trained end-to-end with state-of-the-art 3D CNNs, demonstrating improved metrics through game state integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Fixed Variables: Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting via Flat Scheme and Spatio-temporal Focal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15296v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) has long been a key research focus. Traditionally, these studies assume a fixed number of variables, but in real-world applications, Cyber-Physical Systems often expand as new sensors are deployed, increasing variables in MTSF. In light of this, we introduce a novel task, Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting (EVTSF). This task presents unique challenges, specifically (1) handling inconsistent data shapes caused by adding new variables, and (2) addressing imbalanced spatio-temporal learning, where expanding variables have limited observed data due to the necessity for timely operation. To address these challenges, we propose STEV, a flexible spatio-temporal forecasting framework. STEV includes a new Flat Scheme to tackle the inconsistent data shape issue, which extends the graph-based spatio-temporal modeling architecture into 1D space by flattening the 2D samples along the variable dimension, making the model variable-scale-agnostic while still preserving dynamic spatial correlations through a holistic graph. We introduce a novel Spatio-temporal Focal Learning strategy that incorporates a negative filter to resolve potential conflicts between contrastive learning and graph representation, and a focal contrastive loss as its core to guide the framework to focus on optimizing the expanding variables. We benchmark EVTSF performance using three real-world datasets and compare it against three potential solutions employing SOTA MTSF models tailored for EVSTF. Experimental results show that STEV significantly outperforms its competitors, particularly on expanding variables. Notably, STEV, with only 5% of observations from the expanding period, is on par with SOTA MTSF models trained with complete observations. Further exploration of various expanding strategies underscores the generalizability of STEV in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from the stochastic processes associated with the particle labels. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over a large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the limiting dynamics of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</p></details> |  |

Compared with the traditional trajectory composed of a set of point-estimates obtained by a tracker in the measurement time-series, the trajectory that our series of studies including this paper pursued is given by a curve function of time (FoT). The trajectory FoT provides complete information of the movement of the target over time and can be used to infer the state corresponding to arbitrary time, not only at the measurement time. However, there are no metrics available for comparing and evaluating the trajectory FoT. To address this lacuna, we propose a metric denominated as the spatiotemporal-aligned trajectory integral distance (Star-ID). The StarID associates and aligns the estimated and actual trajectories in the spatio-temporal domain and distinguishes between the time-aligned and unaligned segments in calculating the spatial divergence including false alarm, miss-detection and localization errors. The effectiveness of the proposed distance metric and the time-averaged version is validated through theoretical analysis and numerical examples of a single target or multiple targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Part ...</summary><p>Part I of a series of companion papers; 11 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) sequences, recognized as the gold standard for diagnosing CVDs, can clearly visualize the dynamic flow and reveal pathological conditions within the cerebrovasculature. Therefore, precise segmentation of cerebral arteries (CAs) and classification between their main trunks and branches are crucial for physicians to accurately quantify diseases. However, achieving accurate CA segmentation in DSA sequences remains a challenging task due to small vessels with low contrast, and ambiguity between vessels and residual skull structures. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets limits exploration in the field. In this paper, we introduce a DSA Sequence-based Cerebral Artery segmentation dataset (DSCA), the publicly accessible dataset designed specifically for pixel-level semantic segmentation of CAs. Additionally, we propose DSANet, a spatio-temporal network for CA segmentation in DSA sequences. Unlike existing DSA segmentation methods that focus only on a single frame, the proposed DSANet introduces a separate temporal encoding branch to capture dynamic vessel details across multiple frames. To enhance small vessel segmentation and improve vessel connectivity, we design a novel TemporalFormer module to capture global context and correlations among sequential frames. Furthermore, we develop a Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) module to effectively integrate spatial and temporal features from the encoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSANet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in CA segmentation, achieving a Dice of 0.9033.</p></details> | Published by TMI |

However, existing approaches often produce overly conservative uncertainty intervals at individual spatial units and fail to properly capture uncertainties when aggregating predictions across different spatial scales. This paper presents a novel hierarchical spatio-temporal model based on the conformal prediction framework to address these challenges. Our approach generates circuit-level DER growth predictions and efficiently aggregates them to the substation level while maintaining statistical validity through a tailored non-conformity score. Applied to a decade of DER installation data from a local utility network, our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches, particularly in reducing prediction interval widths while maintaining coverage.</p></details> |  |

They primarily emphasize temporal sharing while overlooking spatial and spectral dimensions. We propose an adaptive, AI-driven spectrum-sharing framework within the O-RAN architecture, integrating discriminative and generative AI (GenAI) to forecast spectrum needs across multiple timescales and spatial granularities. A marketplace model, managed by an authorized spectrum broker, enables operators to trade spectrum dynamically, balancing static assignments with real-time trading. GenAI enhances traffic prediction, spectrum estimation, and allocation, optimizing utilization while reducing costs. This modular, flexible approach fosters operator collaboration, maximizing efficiency and revenue. A key research challenge is refining allocation granularity and spatio-temporal dynamics beyond existing models.</p></details> |  |

We also propose a cyclic encoding technique to ensure continuous time representation. To learn fine-grained spatial air quality estimation, we incorporate AQ-Net with the neural kNN to explore feature-based interpolation, such that we can fill the spatial gaps given coarse observation stations. To demonstrate the efficiency of our model for spatiotemporal reanalysis, we use data from 2013-2017 collected in northern China for PM2.5 analysis. Extensive experiments show that AQ-Net excels in air quality reanalysis, highlighting the potential of hybrid spatio-temporal models to better capture environmental dynamics, especially in urban areas where both spatial and temporal variability are critical.</p></details> |  |

Existing spatio-temporal data secure retrieval schemes have significant shortcomings regarding dynamic updates, either compromising privacy through leakage during updates (forward insecurity) or incurring excessively high update costs that hinder practical application. Under these circumstances, we first propose a basic filter-based spatio-temporal range query scheme \TrinityI that supports low-cost dynamic updates and automatic expansion. Furthermore, to improve security, reduce storage cost, and false positives, we propose a forward secure and verifiable scheme \TrinityII that simultaneously minimizes storage overhead. A formal security analysis proves that \TrinityI and \TrinityII are Indistinguishable under Selective Chosen-Plaintext Attack (IND-SCPA). Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our design \TrinityII significantly reduces storage requirements by 80\%, enables data retrieval at the 1 million-record level in just 0.01 seconds, and achieves 10 $\times$ update efficiency than state-of-art.</p></details> | 14pages,6 figures |

Naturally, automated detection of forged Deepfake videos is attracting a proportional amount of interest of researchers. Current methods for detecting forged videos mainly rely on global frame features and under-utilize the spatio-temporal inconsistencies found in the manipulated videos. Moreover, they fail to attend to manipulation-specific subtle and well-localized pattern variations along both spatial and temporal dimensions. Addressing these gaps, we propose a neural Deepfake detector that focuses on the localized manipulative signatures of the forged videos at individual frame level as well as frame sequence level. Using a ResNet backbone, it strengthens the shallow frame-level feature learning with a spatial attention mechanism. The spatial stream of the model is further helped by fusing texture enhanced shallow features with the deeper features. Simultaneously, the model processes frame sequences with a distance attention mechanism that further allows fusion of temporal attention maps with the learned features at the deeper layers. The overall model is trained to detect forged content as a classifier. We evaluate our method on two popular large data sets and achieve significant performance over the state-of-the-art methods.Moreover, our technique also provides memory and computational advantages over the competitive techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Effective Dynamics across Spatio-Temporal Scales of Complex Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07990v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling and simulation of complex fluid flows with dynamics that span multiple spatio-temporal scales is a fundamental challenge in many scientific and engineering domains. Full-scale resolving simulations for systems such as highly turbulent flows are not feasible in the foreseeable future, and reduced-order models must capture dynamics that involve interactions across scales. In the present work, we propose a novel framework, Graph-based Learning of Effective Dynamics (Graph-LED), that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs), as well as an attention-based autoregressive model, to extract the effective dynamics from a small amount of simulation data. GNNs represent flow fields on unstructured meshes as graphs and effectively handle complex geometries and non-uniform grids. The proposed method combines a GNN based, dimensionality reduction for variable-size unstructured meshes with an autoregressive temporal attention model that can learn temporal dependencies automatically. We evaluated the proposed approach on a suite of fluid dynamics problems, including flow past a cylinder and flow over a backward-facing step over a range of Reynolds numbers. The results demonstrate robust and effective forecasting of spatio-temporal physics; in the case of the flow past a cylinder, both small-scale effects that occur close to the cylinder as well as its wake are accurately captured.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference on Parsimony and Learning (CPAL)</p></details> |

In this paper, we articulate a vision for the future of STFMs, outlining their essential characteristics and the generalization capabilities necessary for broad applicability. We critically assess the current state of research, identifying gaps relative to these ideal traits, and highlight key challenges that impede their progress. Finally, we explore potential opportunities and directions to advance research towards the aim of effective and broadly applicable STFMs.</p></details> |  |

Real-world measurements of such processes are often collected at irregularly distributed points in space, which can be effectively represented as graphs; however, there are currently only a few existing datasets. Our work aims to make advancements in the field of PDE-modeling accessible to the temporal graph machine learning community, while addressing the data scarcity problem, by creating and utilizing datasets based on PDEs. In this work, we create and use synthetic datasets based on PDEs to support spatio-temporal graph modeling in machine learning for different applications. More precisely, we showcase three equations to model different types of disasters and hazards in the fields of epidemiology, atmospheric particles, and tsunami waves. Further, we show how such created datasets can be used by benchmarking several machine learning models on the epidemiological dataset. Additionally, we show how pre-training on this dataset can improve model performance on real-world epidemiological data. The presented methods enable others to create datasets and benchmarks customized to individual requirements.

In particular, ride-hailing vehicles can effectively facilitate flexible data collection and contribute towards urban intelligence, despite resource limitations. Therefore, this work explores a promising scenario, where edge-assisted vehicles perform joint tasks of order serving and the emerging foundation model fine-tuning using various urban data. However, integrating the VCS AI task with the conventional order serving task is challenging, due to their inconsistent spatio-temporal characteristics: (i) The distributions of ride orders and data point-of-interests (PoIs) may not coincide in geography, both following a priori unknown patterns; (ii) they have distinct forms of temporal effects, i.e., prolonged waiting makes orders become instantly invalid while data with increased staleness gradually reduces its utility for model fine-tuning.To overcome these obstacles, we propose an online framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with careful augmentation. A new quality-of-service (QoS) metric is designed to characterize and balance the utility of the two joint tasks, under the effects of varying data volumes and staleness. We also integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) with MARL to enhance state representations, capturing graph-structured, time-varying dependencies among vehicles and across locations. Extensive experiments on our testbed simulator, utilizing various real-world foundation model fine-tuning tasks and the New York City Taxi ride order dataset, demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

This progress enables applications such as match outcome prediction, player scouting, and tactical analysis. In soccer, the effective utilization of event and tracking data is fundamental for capturing and analyzing the dynamics of the game. However, there are two primary challenges: the limited availability of event data, primarily restricted to top-tier teams and leagues, and the scarcity and high cost of tracking data, which complicates its integration with event data for comprehensive analysis. Here we propose OpenSTARLab, an open-source framework designed to democratize spatio-temporal agent data analysis in sports by addressing these key challenges. OpenSTARLab includes the Pre-processing Package that standardizes event and tracking data through Unified and Integrated Event Data and State-Action-Reward formats, the Event Modeling Package that implements deep learning-based event prediction, alongside the RLearn Package for reinforcement learning tasks. These technical components facilitate the handling of diverse data sources and support advanced analytical tasks, thereby enhancing the overall functionality and usability of the framework. To assess OpenSTARLab's effectiveness, we conducted several experimental evaluations. These demonstrate the superior performance of the specific event prediction model in terms of action and time prediction accuracies and maintained its robust event simulation performance. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments reveal a trade-off between action accuracy and temporal difference loss and show comprehensive visualization. Overall, OpenSTARLab serves as a robust platform for researchers and practitioners, enhancing innovation and collaboration in the field of soccer data analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>OpenS...</summary><p>OpenSTARLab is available at https://github.com/open-starlab, and its documentation can be found at https://openstarlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</p></details> |

This task is however challenging due to multiple sign variations, complexity in language and inherent richness of expressions. Computational approaches have evidenced capabilities to support SLT. Nonetheless, these approaches remain limited to cover gestures variability and support long sequence translations. This paper introduces a Transformer-based architecture that encodes spatio-temporal motion gestures, preserving both local and long-range spatial information through the use of multiple convolutional and attention mechanisms. The proposed approach was validated on the Colombian Sign Language Translation Dataset (CoL-SLTD) outperforming baseline approaches, and achieving a BLEU4 of 46.84%. Additionally, the proposed approach was validated on the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T (PHOENIX14T), achieving a BLEU4 score of 30.77%, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in handling real-world variations</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we adapt and specialise the robust and conjugate GP (RCGP) framework of Altamirano et al. (2024) to the spatio-temporal setting. In doing so, we obtain an outlier-robust spatio-temporal GP with a computational cost comparable to classical spatio-temporal GPs. We also overcome the three main drawbacks of RCGPs: their unreliable performance when the prior mean is chosen poorly, their lack of reliable uncertainty quantification, and the need to carefully select a hyperparameter by hand. We study our method extensively in finance and weather forecasting applications, demonstrating that it provides a reliable approach to spatio-temporal modelling in the presence of outliers.</p></details> |  |

We further introduce the TUMTraffic-Qwen baseline model, enhanced with visual token sampling strategies, providing valuable insights into the challenges of fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the dataset's complexity, highlight the limitations of existing models, and position TUMTraffic-VideoQA as a robust foundation for advancing research in intelligent transportation systems.

| **[Automated Extraction of Spatio-Semantic Graphs for Identifying Cognitive Impairment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01685v1)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing methods for analyzing linguistic content from picture descriptions for assessment of cognitive-linguistic impairment often overlook the participant's visual narrative path, which typically requires eye tracking to assess. Spatio-semantic graphs are a useful tool for analyzing this narrative path from transcripts alone, however they are limited by the need for manual tagging of content information units (CIUs). In this paper, we propose an automated approach for estimation of spatio-semantic graphs (via automated extraction of CIUs) from the Cookie Theft picture commonly used in cognitive-linguistic analyses. The method enables the automatic characterization of the visual semantic path during picture description. Experiments demonstrate that the automatic spatio-semantic graphs effectively differentiate between cognitively impaired and unimpaired speakers. Statistical analyses reveal that the features derived by the automated method produce comparable results to the manual method, with even greater group differences between clinical groups of interest. These results highlight the potential of the automated approach for extracting spatio-semantic features in developing clinical speech models for cognitive impairment assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

For this purpose, spatial homogeneity and temporal stationarity are widely used assumptions, and many parametric covariance models have been developed under these assumptions. However, these are strong and unrealistic conditions in many cases. In addition, on the sphere, although different statistical approaches from those on Euclidean space should be applied to build a proper covariance model considering its unique characteristics, relevant studies are rare. In this research, we introduce novel parameterized models of the covariance function for spatially non-homogeneous and temporally non-stationary random processes on the sphere. To alleviate the spatial homogeneity assumption and temporal stationarity, and to consider the spherical domain and time domain together, this research will apply the theories of Intrinsic Random Functions (IRF). We also provide a methodology to estimate the associated parameters for the model. Finally, through a simulation study and analysis of a real-world data set about global temperature anomaly, we demonstrate validity of the suggested covariance model with its advantage of interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Existing state-of-the-art methods, like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), achieve high imputation accuracy; however, they suffer from significant computational costs and are notably time-consuming due to their iterative nature. In this work, we propose CoSTI, an innovative adaptation of Consistency Models (CMs) for the MTSI domain. CoSTI employs Consistency Training to achieve comparable imputation quality to DDPMs while drastically reducing inference times, making it more suitable for real-time applications. We evaluate CoSTI across multiple datasets and missing data scenarios, demonstrating up to a 98% reduction in imputation time with performance on par with diffusion-based models. This work bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in generative imputation tasks, providing a scalable solution for handling missing data in critical spatio-temporal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Deep Spatio-Temporal Architecture for Dynamic Effective Connectivity Network Analysis Based on Dynamic Causal Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18859v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic effective connectivity networks (dECNs) reveal the changing directed brain activity and the dynamic causal influences among brain regions, which facilitate the identification of individual differences and enhance the understanding of human brain. Although the existing causal discovery methods have shown promising results in effective connectivity network analysis, they often overlook the dynamics of causality, in addition to the incorporation of spatio-temporal information in brain activity data. To address these issues, we propose a deep spatio-temporal fusion architecture, which employs a dynamic causal deep encoder to incorporate spatio-temporal information into dynamic causality modeling, and a dynamic causal deep decoder to verify the discovered causality. The effectiveness of the proposed method is first illustrated with simulated data. Then, experimental results from Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in inferring dECNs, which reveal the dynamic evolution of directed flow between brain regions. The analysis shows the difference of dECNs between young adults and children. Specifically, the directed brain functional networks transit from fluctuating undifferentiated systems to more stable specialized networks as one grows. This observation provides further evidence on the modularization and adaptation of brain networks during development, leading to higher cognitive abilities observed in young adults.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation for unbiased cross-validation of spatio-temporal models for species distribution modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03480v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Species Distribution Models (SDMs) often suffer from spatial autocorrelation (SAC), leading to biased performance estimates. We tested cross-validation (CV) strategies - random splits, spatial blocking with varied distances, environmental (ENV) clustering, and a novel spatio-temporal method - under two proposed training schemes: LAST FOLD, widely used in spatial CV at the cost of data loss, and RETRAIN, which maximizes data usage but risks reintroducing SAC. LAST FOLD consistently yielded lower errors and stronger correlations. Spatial blocking at an optimal distance (SP 422) and ENV performed best, achieving Spearman and Pearson correlations of 0.485 and 0.548, respectively, although ENV may be unsuitable for long-term forecasts involving major environmental shifts. A spatio-temporal approach yielded modest benefits in our moderately variable dataset, but may excel with stronger temporal changes. These findings highlight the need to align CV approaches with the spatial and temporal structure of SDM data, ensuring rigorous validation and reliable predictive outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Classification of Mild Cognitive Impairment Based on Dynamic Functional Connectivity Using Spatio-Temporal Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16409v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is an advanced technique for capturing the dynamic changes of neural activities, and can be very useful in the studies of brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, existing studies have not fully leveraged the sequential information embedded within dFC that can potentially provide valuable information when identifying brain conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that jointly learns the embedding of both spatial and temporal information within dFC based on the transformer architecture. Specifically, we first construct dFC networks from rs-fMRI data through a sliding window strategy. Then, we simultaneously employ a temporal block and a spatial block to capture higher-order representations of dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies, via mapping them into an efficient fused feature representation. To further enhance the robustness of these feature representations by reducing the dependency on labeled data, we also introduce a contrastive learning strategy to manipulate different brain states. Experimental results on 345 subjects with 570 scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method for MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment, the prodromal stage of AD) prediction, highlighting its potential for early identification of AD.</p></details> |  |

Rabies is a prominent example with various instances globally, facilitated by a surplus of meso-predators (commonly, facultative synanthropic species e.g., golden jackals [Canis aureus, hereafter jackals]) thanks to the abundance of anthropogenic resources leading to dense populations close to human establishments. To mitigate rabies outbreaks and prevent human infections, authorities target the jackal which is the main rabies vector in many regions, through the dissemination of oral vaccines in known jackals' activity centers, as well as opportunistic culling to reduce population density. Because dilution (i.e., culling) is not selective towards sick or un-vaccinated individuals, these two complementary epizootic intervention policies (EIPs) can interfere with each other. Nonetheless, there is only limited examination of the interactive effectiveness of these EIPs and their potential influence on rabies epizootic spread dynamics, highlighting the need to understand these measures and the spread of rabies in wild jackals. In this study, we introduce a novel spatio-temporal extended-SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model with a graph-based spatial framework for evaluating mitigation efficiency. We implement the model in a case study using a jackal population in northern Israel, and using spatial and movement data collected by Advanced Tracking and Localization of Animals in real-life Systems (ATLAS) telemetry. An agent-based simulation approach allows us to explore various biologically-realistic scenarios, and assess the impact of different EIPs configurations. Our model suggests that under biologically-realistic underlying assumptions and scenarios, the effectiveness of both EIPs is not influenced much by the jackal population size but is sensitive to their dispersal between activity centers.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-temporal Graph Network Allowing Incomplete Trajectory Input for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13973v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is important in the research of mobile robot navigation in environments with pedestrians. Most pedestrian trajectory prediction algorithms require the input historical trajectories to be complete. If a pedestrian is unobservable in any frame in the past, then its historical trajectory become incomplete, the algorithm will not predict its future trajectory. To address this limitation, we propose the STGN-IT, a spatio-temporal graph network allowing incomplete trajectory input, which can predict the future trajectories of pedestrians with incomplete historical trajectories. STGN-IT uses the spatio-temporal graph with an additional encoding method to represent the historical trajectories and observation states of pedestrians. Moreover, STGN-IT introduces static obstacles in the environment that may affect the future trajectories as nodes to further improve the prediction accuracy. A clustering algorithm is also applied in the construction of spatio-temporal graphs. Experiments on public datasets show that STGN-IT outperforms state of the art algorithms on these metrics.</p></details> |  |

However, existing GCN-based methods face critical limitations: (1) they lack effective spatio-temporal topology modeling that captures dynamic variations in skeletal motion, and (2) they struggle to model multiscale structural relationships beyond local joint connectivity. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Semantic Awareness Graph Convolutional Network (DSTSA-GCN). DSTSA-GCN introduces three key modules: Group Channel-wise Graph Convolution (GC-GC), Group Temporal-wise Graph Convolution (GT-GC), and Multi-Scale Temporal Convolution (MS-TCN). GC-GC and GT-GC operate in parallel to independently model channel-specific and frame-specific correlations, enabling robust topology learning that accounts for temporal variations. Additionally, both modules employ a grouping strategy to adaptively capture multiscale structural relationships. Complementing this, MS-TCN enhances temporal modeling through group-wise temporal convolutions with diverse receptive fields. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSTSA-GCN significantly improves the topology modeling capabilities of GCNs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets for gesture and action recognition, including SHREC17 Track, DHG-14\/28, NTU-RGB+D, and NTU-RGB+D-120.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submit to Neurocomputing</p></details> |

In this regard, covariance properties with respect to geometric image transformations in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy are essential for expressing robust image operations, and for formulating invariant visual operations at higher levels. This paper defines and proves a set of joint covariance properties for spatio-temporal receptive fields in terms of spatio-temporal derivative operators applied to spatio-temporally smoothed image data under compositions of spatial scaling transformations, spatial affine transformations, Galilean transformations and temporal scaling transformations. Specifically, the derived relations show how the parameters of the receptive fields need to be transformed, in order to match the output from spatio-temporal receptive fields under composed spatio-temporal image transformations. For this purpose, we also fundamentally extend the notion of scale-normalized derivatives to affine-normalized derivatives, that are computed based on spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels, and analyze the covariance properties of the resulting affine-normalized derivatives for the affine group as well as for important subgroups thereof. We conclude with a geometric analysis, showing how the derived joint covariance properties make it possible to relate or match spatio-temporal receptive field responses, when observing, possibly moving, local surface patches from different views, under locally linearized perspective or projective transformations, as well as when observing different instances of spatio-temporal events, that may occur either faster or slower between different views of similar spatio-temporal events.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 19 figures.

The sound generated by vessels can have various adverse effects on fish and aquatic ecosystems in general. In this setting, the estimation and analysis of the underwater noise produced by vessels is an important challenge for the preservation of the marine environment. In this paper we propose a model for the spatio-temporal characterisation of the underwater noise generated by vessels. The approach is based on the reconstruction of the vessels' trajectories from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and on their deployment in a spatio-temporal database. Trajectories are enriched with semantic information like the acoustic characteristics of the vessels' engines or the activity performed by the vessels. We define a model for underwater noise propagation and use the trajectories' information to infer how noise propagates in the area of interest. We develop our approach for the case study of the fishery activities in the Northern Adriatic sea, an area of the Mediterranean sea which is well known to be highly exploited. We implement our approach using MobilityDB, an open source geospatial trajectory data management and analysis platform, which offers spatio-temporal operators and indexes improving the efficiency of our system. We use this platform to conduct various analyses of the underwater noise generated in the Northern Adriatic Sea, aiming at estimating the impact of fishing activities on underwater noise pollution and at demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Different regions in the area exhibit different characteristics while having latent correlations. This spatial heterogeneity and correlations greatly affect the spatio-temporal distributions of event occurrences, which has not been addressed by state-of-the-art models. Learning spatial dependencies of events in a continuous space is challenging due to its fine granularity and a lack of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a novel Graph Spatio-Temporal Point Process (GSTPP) model for fine-grained event prediction. It adopts an encoder-decoder architecture that jointly models the state dynamics of spatially localized regions using neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). The state evolution is built on the foundation of a novel Self-Adaptive Anchor Graph (SAAG) that captures spatial dependencies. By adaptively localizing the anchor nodes in the space and jointly constructing the correlation edges between them, the SAAG enhances the model's ability of learning complex spatial event patterns. The proposed GSTPP model greatly improves the accuracy of fine-grained event prediction. Extensive experimental results show that our method greatly improves the prediction accuracy over existing spatio-temporal event prediction approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIAM International Conference on Data Mining 2025 (SDM'25)</p></details> |

Multi-sensor synchronous measurement has proven to be more effective for WHAR than using a single sensor. However, existing WHAR methods use shared convolutional kernels for indiscriminate temporal feature extraction across each sensor variable, which fails to effectively capture spatio-temporal relationships of intra-sensor and inter-sensor variables. We propose the DecomposeWHAR model consisting of a decomposition phase and a fusion phase to better model the relationships between modality variables. The decomposition creates high-dimensional representations of each intra-sensor variable through the improved Depth Separable Convolution to capture local temporal features while preserving their unique characteristics. The fusion phase begins by capturing relationships between intra-sensor variables and fusing their features at both the channel and variable levels. Long-range temporal dependencies are modeled using the State Space Model (SSM), and later cross-sensor interactions are dynamically captured through a self-attention mechanism, highlighting inter-sensor spatial correlations. Our model demonstrates superior performance on three widely used WHAR datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models while maintaining acceptable computational efficiency.

| **[Vulnerability-Aware Spatio-Temporal Learning for Generalizable and Interpretable Deepfake Video Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01184v2)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting deepfake videos is highly challenging due to the complex intertwined spatial and temporal artifacts in forged sequences. Most recent approaches rely on binary classifiers trained on both real and fake data. However, such methods may struggle to focus on important artifacts, which can hinder their generalization capability. Additionally, these models often lack interpretability, making it difficult to understand how predictions are made. To address these issues, we propose FakeSTormer, offering two key contributions. First, we introduce a multi-task learning framework with additional spatial and temporal branches that enable the model to focus on subtle spatio-temporal artifacts. These branches also provide interpretability by highlighting video regions that may contain artifacts. Second, we propose a video-level data synthesis algorithm that generates pseudo-fake videos with subtle artifacts, providing the model with high-quality samples and ground truth data for our spatial and temporal branches. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate the competitiveness of our approach compared to recent state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/10Ring/FakeSTormer.</p></details> |  |

Concretely, earth science systems rely heavily on the extensive deployment of sensors, however, the data collection from sensors is constrained by complex geographical and social factors, making it challenging to achieve comprehensive coverage and uniform deployment. To alleviate the obstacle, traditional approaches to sensor deployment utilize specific algorithms to design and deploy sensors. These methods \textit{dynamically adjust the activation times of sensors to optimize the detection process across each sub-region}. Regrettably, formulating an activation strategy generally based on historical observations and geographic characteristics, which make the methods and resultant models were neither simple nor practical. Worse still, the complex technical design may ultimately lead to a model with weak generalizability. In this paper, we introduce for the first time the concept of spatio-temporal data dynamic sparse training and are committed to adaptively, dynamically filtering important sensor distributions. To our knowledge, this is the \textbf{first} proposal (\textit{termed DynST}) of an \textbf{industry-level} deployment optimization concept at the data level. However, due to the existence of the temporal dimension, pruning of spatio-temporal data may lead to conflicts at different timestamps. To achieve this goal, we employ dynamic merge technology, along with ingenious dimensional mapping to mitigate potential impacts caused by the temporal aspect. During the training process, DynST utilize iterative pruning and sparse training, repeatedly identifying and dynamically removing sensor perception areas that contribute the least to future predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Get Rid of Isolation: A Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10524v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal learning has become a pivotal technique to enable urban intelligence. Traditional spatiotemporal models mostly focus on a specific task by assuming a same distribution between training and testing sets. However, given that urban systems are usually dynamic, multi-sourced with imbalanced data distributions, current specific task-specific models fail to generalize to new urban conditions and adapt to new domains without explicitly modeling interdependencies across various dimensions and types of urban data. To this end, we argue that there is an essential to propose a Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal learning framework (CMuST) to empower collective urban intelligence, which reforms the urban spatiotemporal learning from single-domain to cooperatively multi-dimensional and multi-task learning. Specifically, CMuST proposes a new multi-dimensional spatiotemporal interaction network (MSTI) to allow cross-interactions between context and main observations as well as self-interactions within spatial and temporal aspects to be exposed, which is also the core for capturing task-level commonality and personalization. To ensure continuous task learning, a novel Rolling Adaptation training scheme (RoAda) is devised, which not only preserves task uniqueness by constructing data summarization-driven task prompts, but also harnesses correlated patterns among tasks by iterative model behavior modeling. We further establish a benchmark of three cities for multi-task spatiotemporal learning, and empirically demonstrate the superiority of CMuST via extensive evaluations on these datasets. The impressive improvements on both few-shot streaming data and new domain tasks against existing SOAT methods are achieved.

Point processes specified on linear networks can provide a more accurate description of crime incidents by considering the geometry of the city. We propose a spatio-temporal Dirichlet process mixture model on a linear network to analyze crime events in Valencia, Spain. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model with a Dirichlet process prior to automatically detect space-time clusters of the events and adopt a convolution kernel estimator to account for the network structure in the city. From the fitted model, we provide crime hotspot visualizations that can inform social interventions to prevent crime incidents. Furthermore, we study the relationships between the detected cluster centers and the city's amenities, which provides an intuitive explanation of criminal contagion.</p></details> |  |

We provide theoretical arguments for the different temporal blocks and use a multitude of tests across different datasets to assess our hypotheses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Attentive Spatio-Temporal Calibration for Precise Intermediate Layer Matching in ANN-to-SNN Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08049v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising for low-power computation due to their event-driven mechanism but often suffer from lower accuracy compared to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). ANN-to-SNN knowledge distillation can improve SNN performance, but previous methods either focus solely on label information, missing valuable intermediate layer features, or use a layer-wise approach that neglects spatial and temporal semantic inconsistencies, leading to performance degradation.To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called self-attentive spatio-temporal calibration (SASTC). SASTC uses self-attention to identify semantically aligned layer pairs between ANN and SNN, both spatially and temporally. This enables the autonomous transfer of relevant semantic information. Extensive experiments show that SASTC outperforms existing methods, effectively solving the mismatching problem. Superior accuracy results include 95.12% on CIFAR-10, 79.40% on CIFAR-100 with 2 time steps, and 68.69% on ImageNet with 4 time steps for static datasets, and 97.92% on DVS-Gesture and 83.60% on DVS-CIFAR10 for neuromorphic datasets. This marks the first time SNNs have outperformed ANNs on both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, shedding the new light on the potential applications of SNNs.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches typically utilize external information such as semantic maps to improve video prediction accuracy, which often neglect the inherent physical knowledge embedded within videos. Worse still, their high computational costs could impede their applications for high-resolution videos. To address these constraints, we introduce a novel framework called \underline{P}hysics-\underline{a}ssisted \underline{S}patio-\underline{t}emporal \underline{Net}work (PastNet) for high-quality video prediction. The core of PastNet lies in incorporating a spectral convolution operator in the Fourier domain, which efficiently introduces inductive biases from the underlying physical laws. Additionally, we employ a memory bank with the estimated intrinsic dimensionality to discretize local features during the processing of complex spatio-temporal signals, thereby reducing computational costs and facilitating efficient high-resolution video prediction. Extensive experiments on various widely-used spatio-temporal video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed PastNet compared with a range of state-of-the-art methods, particularly in high-resolution scenarios.</p></details> | 11 |
| **[STTS-EAD: Improving Spatio-Temporal Learning Based Time Series Prediction via](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07814v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Handling anomalies is a critical preprocessing step in multivariate time series prediction. However, existing approaches that separate anomaly preprocessing from model training for multivariate time series prediction encounter significant limitations. Specifically, these methods fail to utilize auxiliary information crucial for identifying latent anomalies associated with spatiotemporal factors during the preprocessing stage. Instead, they rely solely on data distribution for anomaly detection, which can result in the incorrect processing of numerous samples that could otherwise contribute positively to model training. To address this, we propose STTS-EAD, an end-to-end method that seamlessly integrates anomaly detection into the training process of multivariate time series forecasting and aims to improve Spatio-Temporal learning based Time Series prediction via Embedded Anomaly Detection. Our proposed STTS-EAD leverages spatio-temporal information for forecasting and anomaly detection, with the two parts alternately executed and optimized for each other. To the best of our knowledge, STTS-EAD is the first to integrate anomaly detection and forecasting tasks in the training phase for improving the accuracy of multivariate time series forecasting. Extensive experiments on a public stock dataset and two real-world sales datasets from a renowned coffee chain enterprise show that our proposed method can effectively process detected anomalies in the training stage to improve forecasting performance in the inference stage and significantly outperform baselines.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Neural Network Forecasting Approach for Emulation of Firefront Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08523v4)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational simulations of wildfire spread typically employ empirical rate-of-spread calculations under various conditions (such as terrain, fuel type, weather). Small perturbations in conditions can often lead to significant changes in fire spread (such as speed and direction), necessitating a computationally expensive large set of simulations to quantify uncertainty. Model emulation seeks alternative representations of physical models using machine learning, aiming to provide more efficient and/or simplified surrogate models. We propose a dedicated spatio-temporal neural network based framework for model emulation, able to capture the complex behaviour of fire spread models. The proposed approach can approximate forecasts at fine spatial and temporal resolutions that are often challenging for neural network based approaches. Furthermore, the proposed approach is robust even with small training sets, due to novel data augmentation methods. Empirical experiments show good agreement between simulated and emulated firefronts, with an average Jaccard score of 0.76.</p></details> |  |
| **[KITS: Inductive Spatio-Temporal Kriging with Increment Training Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02565v2)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sensors are commonly deployed to perceive the environment. However, due to the high cost, sensors are usually sparsely deployed. Kriging is the tailored task to infer the unobserved nodes (without sensors) using the observed source nodes (with sensors). The essence of kriging task is transferability. Recently, several inductive spatio-temporal kriging methods have been proposed based on graph neural networks, being trained based on a graph built on top of observed nodes via pretext tasks such as masking nodes out and reconstructing them. However, the graph in training is inevitably much sparser than the graph in inference that includes all the observed and unobserved nodes. The learned pattern cannot be well generalized for inference, denoted as graph gap. To address this issue, we first present a novel Increment training strategy: instead of masking nodes (and reconstructing them), we add virtual nodes into the training graph so as to mitigate the graph gap issue naturally. Nevertheless, the empty-shell virtual nodes without labels could have bad-learned features and lack supervision signals. To solve these issues, we pair each virtual node with its most similar observed node and fuse their features together; to enhance the supervision signal, we construct reliable pseudo labels for virtual nodes. As a result, the learned pattern of virtual nodes could be safely transferred to real unobserved nodes for reliable kriging. We name our new Kriging model with Increment Training Strategy as KITS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KITS consistently outperforms existing kriging methods by large margins, e.g., the improvement over MAE score could be as high as 18.33%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by AAAI'25</p></details> |
| **[AutoSTF: Decoupled Neural Architecture Search for Cost-Effective Automated Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16586v2)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is a critical component of various smart city applications, such as transportation optimization, energy management, and socio-economic analysis. Recently, several automated spatio-temporal forecasting methods have been proposed to automatically search the optimal neural network architecture for capturing complex spatio-temporal dependencies. However, the existing automated approaches suffer from expensive neural architecture search overhead, which hinders their practical use and the further exploration of diverse spatio-temporal operators in a finer granularity. In this paper, we propose AutoSTF, a decoupled automatic neural architecture search framework for cost-effective automated spatio-temporal forecasting. From the efficiency perspective, we first decouple the mixed search space into temporal space and spatial space and respectively devise representation compression and parameter-sharing schemes to mitigate the parameter explosion. The decoupled spatio-temporal search not only expedites the model optimization process but also leaves new room for more effective spatio-temporal dependency modeling. From the effectiveness perspective, we propose a multi-patch transfer module to jointly capture multi-granularity temporal dependencies and extend the spatial search space to enable finer-grained layer-wise spatial dependency search. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the superiority of AutoSTF in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, our proposed method achieves up to 13.48x speed-up compared to state-of-the-art automatic spatio-temporal forecasting methods while maintaining the best forecasting accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2025 Research Track</p></details> |

However, due to the high heterogeneity in structure and semantics among various spatio-temporal modalities, the joint interpretation of multimodal spatio-temporal data has long been an extremely challenging problem. The primary challenge resides in striking a trade-off between the cohesion and autonomy of diverse modalities. This trade-off becomes progressively nonlinear as the number of modalities expands. Inspired by the human cognitive system and linguistic philosophy, where perceptual signals from the five senses converge into language, we introduce the Language as Reference Framework (LaRF), a fundamental principle for constructing a multimodal unified model. Building upon this, we propose AllSpark, a multimodal spatio-temporal general artificial intelligence model. Our model integrates ten different modalities into a unified framework. To achieve modal cohesion, AllSpark introduces a modal bridge and multimodal large language model (LLM) to map diverse modal features into the language feature space. To maintain modality autonomy, AllSpark uses modality-specific encoders to extract the tokens of various spatio-temporal modalities. Finally, observing a gap between the model's interpretability and downstream tasks, we designed modality-specific prompts and task heads, enhancing the model's generalization capability across specific tasks. Experiments indicate that the incorporation of language enables AllSpark to excel in few-shot classification tasks for RGB and point cloud modalities without additional training, surpassing baseline performance by up to 41.82\%.

This paper proposes an innovative traffic flow prediction network, SFADNet, which categorizes traffic flow into multiple traffic patterns based on temporal and spatial feature matrices. For each pattern, we construct an independent adaptive spatio-temporal fusion graph based on a cross-attention mechanism, employing residual graph convolution modules and time series modules to better capture dynamic spatio-temporal relationships under different fine-grained traffic patterns. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SFADNet outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines across four large-scale datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 lEEE International Conference on Acoustics, speech, and signal Processing (lCASSP2025)</p></details> |
| **[STContext: A Multifaceted Dataset for Developing Context-aware Spatio-temporal Crowd Mobility Prediction Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03583v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In smart cities, context-aware spatio-temporal crowd flow prediction (STCFP) models leverage contextual features (e.g., weather) to identify unusual crowd mobility patterns and enhance prediction accuracy. However, the best practice for incorporating contextual features remains unclear due to inconsistent usage of contextual features in different papers. Developing a multifaceted dataset with rich types of contextual features and STCFP scenarios is crucial for establishing a principled context modeling paradigm. Existing open crowd flow datasets lack an adequate range of contextual features, which poses an urgent requirement to build a multifaceted dataset to fill these research gaps. To this end, we create STContext, a multifaceted dataset for developing context-aware STCFP models. Specifically, STContext provides nine spatio-temporal datasets across five STCFP scenarios and includes ten contextual features, including weather, air quality index, holidays, points of interest, road networks, etc. Besides, we propose a unified workflow for incorporating contextual features into deep STCFP methods, with steps including feature transformation, dependency modeling, representation fusion, and training strategies. Through extensive experiments, we have obtained several useful guidelines for effective context modeling and insights for future research.

Most approaches explore spatio-temporal information of multi-scan to identify the semantic classes and motion states for each point. However, these methods often overlook the segmentation consistency in space and time, which may result in point clouds within the same object being predicted as different categories. To handle this issue, our core idea is to generate cluster labels across multiple frames that can reflect the complete spatial structure and temporal information of objects. These labels serve as explicit guidance for our dual-branch network, 4D-CS, which integrates point-based and cluster-based branches to enable more consistent segmentation. Specifically, in the point-based branch, we leverage historical knowledge to enrich the current feature through temporal fusion on multiple views. In the cluster-based branch, we propose a new strategy to produce cluster labels of foreground objects and apply them to gather point-wise information to derive cluster features. We then merge neighboring clusters across multiple scans to restore missing features due to occlusion. Finally, in the point-cluster fusion stage, we adaptively fuse the information from the two branches to optimize segmentation results. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, and we achieve state-of-the-art results on the multi-scan semantic and moving object segmentation on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets.

However, the high costs of building sensor networks limit their scale and coverage, making fine-grained deployment challenging. Inductive Spatio-Temporal Kriging (ISK) addresses this issue by introducing virtual sensors. Based on graph neural networks (GNNs) extracting the relationships between physical and virtual sensors, ISK can infer the measurements of virtual sensors from physical sensors. However, current ISK methods rely on conventional message-passing mechanisms and network architectures, without effectively extracting spatio-temporal features of physical sensors and focusing on representing virtual sensors. Additionally, existing graph construction methods face issues of sparse and noisy connections, destroying ISK performance. To address these issues, we propose DarkFarseer, a novel ISK framework with three key components. First, we propose the Neighbor Hidden Style Enhancement module with a style transfer strategy to enhance the representation of virtual nodes in a temporal-then-spatial manner to better extract the spatial relationships between physical and virtual nodes. Second, we propose Virtual-Component Contrastive Learning, which aims to enrich the node representation by establishing the association between the patterns of virtual nodes and the regional patterns within graph components. Lastly, we design a Similarity-Based Graph Denoising Strategy, which reduces the connectivity strength of noisy connections around virtual nodes and their neighbors based on their temporal information and regional spatial patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DarkFarseer significantly outperforms existing ISK methods.</p></details> | TKDE (Under Review) |

However, these models often struggle with balancing computational efficiency and model flexibility. To address this challenge, this study develops a fast and flexible method for STVC modeling. For enhanced flexibility in modeling, we assume multiple processes in each varying coefficient, including purely spatial, purely temporal, and spatio-temporal interaction processes with or without time cyclicity. While considering multiple processes can be time consuming, we combine a pre-conditioning method with a model selection procedure, inspired by reluctant interaction modeling. This approach allows us to computationally efficiently select and specify the latent space-time structure. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms alternatives in terms of coefficient estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. Finally, we apply the proposed method to crime analysis using a sample size of 279,360, confirming that the proposed method provides reasonable estimates of varying coefficients. The STVC model is implemented in an R package spmoran.</p></details> |  |

| **[Temporal Encoding Strategies for Energy Time Series Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15456v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In contemporary power systems, energy consumption prediction plays a crucial role in maintaining grid stability and resource allocation enabling power companies to minimize energy waste and avoid overloading the grid. While there are several research works on energy optimization, they often fail to address the complexities of real-time fluctuations and the cyclic pattern of energy consumption. This work proposes a novel approach to enhance the accuracy of predictive models by employing sinusoidal encoding on periodic features of time-series data. To demonstrate the increase in performance, several statistical and ensemble machine learning models were trained on an energy demand dataset, using the proposed sinusoidal encoding. The performance of these models was then benchmarked against identical models trained on traditional encoding methods. The results demonstrated a 12.6% improvement of Root Mean Squared Error (from 0.5497 to 0.4802) and a 7.8% increase in the R^2 score (from 0.7530 to 0.8118), indicating that the proposed encoding better captures the cyclic nature of temporal patterns than traditional methods. The proposed methodology significantly improves prediction accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications in smart grid systems.</p></details> |  |

Simon two-stage designs are often used. Sargent et al. proposed a three-outcome trial design in this setting which requires smaller sample sizes. For many new, molecularly targeted therapies, however, tumor response may not be the most reliable endpoint for measuring anti-tumor activity. Increasingly, time-to-event endpoints, such as progression-free survival (PFS), are used in the phase II setting. When such endpoints are the primary measure of efficacy, a randomized concurrently controlled study design is usually required. Given limited resources for phase II, studies are often underpowered with relatively large type I and II error rates, and it is sometimes unavoidable to have a "gray" decision zone after phase II where a clear decision regarding further development actions cannot be made without additional information. Compared with an underpowered standard two-outcome study, a three-outcome design prompts clinical trialists to contemplate the likelihood of landing in the "gray" zone at the trial design stage and choose study design parameters more appropriately. We propose a three-outcome design, with or without interim analyses, for randomized comparative phase II trials when a time-to-event endpoint is used.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards efficient keyword spotting using spike-based time difference encoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15402v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Keyword spotting in edge devices is becoming increasingly important as voice-activated assistants are widely used. However, its deployment is often limited by the extreme low-power constraints of the target embedded systems. Here, we explore the Temporal Difference Encoder (TDE) performance in keyword spotting. This recent neuron model encodes the time difference in instantaneous frequency and spike count to perform efficient keyword spotting with neuromorphic processors. We use the TIdigits dataset of spoken digits with a formant decomposition and rate-based encoding into spikes. We compare three Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) architectures to learn and classify spatio-temporal signals. The proposed SNN architectures are made of three layers with variation in its hidden layer composed of either (1) feedforward TDE, (2) feedforward Current-Based Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (CuBa-LIF), or (3) recurrent CuBa-LIF neurons. We first show that the spike trains of the frequency-converted spoken digits have a large amount of information in the temporal domain, reinforcing the importance of better exploiting temporal encoding for such a task. We then train the three SNNs with the same number of synaptic weights to quantify and compare their performance based on the accuracy and synaptic operations. The resulting accuracy of the feedforward TDE network (89%) is higher than the feedforward CuBa-LIF network (71%) and close to the recurrent CuBa-LIF network (91%). However, the feedforward TDE-based network performs 92% fewer synaptic operations than the recurrent CuBa-LIF network with the same amount of synapses. In addition, the results of the TDE network are highly interpretable and correlated with the frequency and timescale features of the spoken keywords in the dataset. Our findings suggest that the TDE is a promising neuron model for scalable event-driven processing of spatio-temporal patterns.</p></details> | 26 pages, 9 figures |

Under mild assumptions, we obtain a uniform-in-time $O(\eta^2)$ bound for the KL-divergence between the SGLD iteration and the Langevin diffusion, where $\eta$ is the step size (or learning rate). Our analysis is also valid for varying step sizes. Consequently, we are able to derive an $O(\eta)$ bound for the distance between the invariant measures of the SGLD iteration and the Langevin diffusion, in terms of Wasserstein or total variation distances. Our result can be viewed as a significant improvement compared with existing analysis for SGLD in related literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-Time Backdoor Detection for Object Detection Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15293v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers poison a small subset of training samples by embedding a predefined trigger to manipulate prediction. Detecting poisoned samples (i.e., those containing triggers) at test time can prevent backdoor activation. However, unlike image classification tasks, the unique characteristics of object detection -- particularly its output of numerous objects -- pose fresh challenges for backdoor detection. The complex attack effects (e.g., "ghost" object emergence or "vanishing" object) further render current defenses fundamentally inadequate. To this end, we design TRAnsformation Consistency Evaluation (TRACE), a brand-new method for detecting poisoned samples at test time in object detection. Our journey begins with two intriguing observations: (1) poisoned samples exhibit significantly more consistent detection results than clean ones across varied backgrounds. (2) clean samples show higher detection consistency when introduced to different focal information. Based on these phenomena, TRACE applies foreground and background transformations to each test sample, then assesses transformation consistency by calculating the variance in objects confidences.

| **[AI-driven control of bioelectric signalling for real-time topological reorganization of cells](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13489v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and manipulating bioelectric signaling could present a new wave of progress in developmental biology, regenerative medicine, and synthetic biology. Bioelectric signals, defined as voltage gradients across cell membranes caused by ionic movements, play a role in regulating crucial processes including cellular differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and tissue morphogenesis. Recent studies demonstrate the ability to modulate these signals to achieve controlled tissue regeneration and morphological outcomes in organisms such as planaria and frogs. However, significant knowledge gaps remain, particularly in predicting and controlling the spatial and temporal dynamics of membrane potentials (V_mem), understanding their regulatory roles in tissue and organ development, and exploring their therapeutic potential in diseases. In this work we propose an experiment using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework together with lab automation techniques for real-time manipulation of bioelectric signals to guide tissue regeneration and morphogenesis. The proposed framework should interact continuously with biological systems, adapting strategies based on direct biological feedback. Combining DRL with real-time measurement techniques -- such as optogenetics, voltage-sensitive dyes, fluorescent reporters, and advanced microscopy -- could provide a comprehensive platform for precise bioelectric control, leading to improved understanding of bioelectric mechanisms in morphogenesis, quantitative bioelectric models, identification of minimal experimental setups, and advancements in bioelectric modulation techniques relevant to regenerative medicine and cancer therapy. Ultimately, this research aims to utilize bioelectric signaling to develop new biomedical and bioengineering applications.</p></details> |  |

While numerous imputation algorithms have been developed to address these data gaps, existing libraries provide limited support. Furthermore, they often lack the ability to simulate realistic patterns of time series missing data and fail to account for the impact of imputation on subsequent downstream analysis. This paper introduces ImputeGAP, a comprehensive library for time series imputation that supports a diverse range of imputation methods and modular missing data simulation catering to datasets with varying characteristics. The library includes extensive customization options, such as automated hyperparameter tuning, benchmarking, explainability, downstream evaluation, and compatibility with popular time series frameworks.</p></details> |  |

This benchmark addresses the gap in current evaluations that often overlook the ability of models to comprehend and produce code constrained by computational complexity. BigO(Bench) includes tooling to infer the algorithmic complexity of any Python function from profiling measurements, including human- or LLM-generated solutions. BigO(Bench) also includes of set of 3,105 coding problems and 1,190,250 solutions from Code Contests annotated with inferred (synthetic) time and space complexity labels from the complexity framework, as well as corresponding runtime and memory footprint values for a large set of input sizes. We present results from evaluating multiple state-of-the-art language models on this benchmark, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in handling complexity requirements. In particular, token-space reasoning models are unrivaled in code generation but not in complexity understanding, hinting that they may not generalize well to tasks for which no reward was given at training time.</p></details> |  |

Strategies such as motion washout, which return the platform to its center, are crucial in these settings. For serial robotic MSPs with highly nonlinear workspaces, it is essential to maximize the efficient utilization of the MSPs kinematic and dynamic capabilities. Traditional approaches, including classical washout filtering and linear model predictive control, fail to consider platform-specific, nonlinear properties, while nonlinear model predictive control, though comprehensive, imposes high computational demands that hinder real-time, pilot-in-the-loop application without further simplification. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning for motion cueing, demonstrated here for the first time in a 6-degree-of-freedom setting with full consideration of the MSPs kinematic nonlinearities. Previous work by the authors successfully demonstrated the application of DRL to a simplified 2-DOF setup, which did not consider kinematic or dynamic constraints. This approach has been extended to all 6 DOF by incorporating a complete kinematic model of the MSP into the algorithm, a crucial step for enabling its application on a real motion simulator. The training of the DRL-MCA is based on Proximal Policy Optimization in an actor-critic implementation combined with an automated hyperparameter optimization. After detailing the necessary training framework and the algorithm itself, we provide a comprehensive validation, demonstrating that the DRL MCA achieves competitive performance against established algorithms. Moreover, it generates feasible trajectories by respecting all system constraints and meets all real-time requirements with low...</p></details> |  |

However, their high sensitivity also makes them susceptible to background noise, which can obscure these signals. This noise often includes transient artifacts called "glitches" that can mimic astrophysical signals or mask their characteristics. Fast and accurate reconstruction of both signals and glitches is crucial for reliable scientific inference. In this study, we present DeepExtractor, a deep learning framework designed to reconstruct signals and glitches with power exceeding interferometer noise, regardless of their source. We design DeepExtractor to model the inherent noise distribution of GW interferometers, following conventional assumptions that the noise is Gaussian and stationary over short time scales. It operates by predicting and subtracting the noise component of the data, retaining only the clean reconstruction. Our approach achieves superior generalization capabilities for arbitrary signals and glitches compared to methods that directly map inputs to the clean training waveforms. We validate DeepExtractor's effectiveness through three experiments: (1) reconstructing simulated glitches injected into simulated detector noise, (2) comparing performance with the state-of-the-art BayesWave algorithm, and (3) analyzing real data from the Gravity Spy dataset to demonstrate effective glitch subtraction from LIGO strain data. DeepExtractor achieves a median mismatch of only 0.9% for simulated glitches, outperforming several deep learning baselines. Additionally, DeepExtractor surpasses BayesWave in glitch recovery, offering a dramatic computational speedup by reconstructing one glitch sample in approx. 0.1 seconds on a CPU, compared to BayesWave's processing time of approx. one hour per glitch.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 16 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Traditional failure recovery methods rely on predefined strategies or human intervention, making them less adaptable. This paper presents a unified failure recovery framework that combines Vision-Language Models (VLMs), a reactive planner, and Behavior Trees (BTs) to enable real-time failure handling. Our approach includes pre-execution verification, which checks for potential failures before execution, and reactive failure handling, which detects and corrects failures during execution by verifying existing BT conditions, adding missing preconditions and, when necessary, generating new skills. The framework uses a scene graph for structured environmental perception and an execution history for continuous monitoring, enabling context-aware and adaptive failure handling. We evaluate our framework through real-world experiments with an ABB YuMi robot on tasks like peg insertion, object sorting, and drawer placement, as well as in AI2-THOR simulator. Compared to using pre-execution and reactive methods separately, our approach achieves higher task success rates and greater adaptability. Ablation studies highlight the importance of VLM-based reasoning, structured scene representation, and execution history tracking for effective failure recovery in robotics.</p></details> |  |

However, existing studies primarily utilize static historical data and often overlook dynamic, real-time contextual factors crucial for precise prediction, particularly in densely populated Indian cities. This research addresses these gaps by integrating real-time contextual variables such as traffic density, weather conditions, local events, and geospatial data (restaurant and delivery location coordinates) into predictive models. We systematically compare various machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Bagging, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM, on a comprehensive food delivery dataset specific to Indian urban contexts. Rigorous data preprocessing and feature selection significantly enhanced model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the LightGBM model achieves superior predictive accuracy, with an R2 score of 0.76 and Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 20.59, outperforming traditional baseline approaches. Our study thus provides actionable insights for improving logistics strategies in complex urban environments.

Existing methods typically search for the optimal DAG by optimizing an objective function but face scalability challenges, as their computational demands grow exponentially with the dimensional expansion of variables. To this end, we propose LOCAL, a highly efficient, easy-to-implement, and constraint-free method for recovering dynamic causal structures. LOCAL is the first attempt to formulate a quasi-maximum likelihood-based score function for learning the dynamic DAG equivalent to the ground truth. Building on this, we introduce two adaptive modules that enhance the algebraic characterization of acyclicity: Asymptotic Causal Mask Learning (ACML) and Dynamic Graph Parameter Learning (DGPL). ACML constructs causal masks using learnable priority vectors and the Gumbel-Sigmoid function, ensuring DAG formation while optimizing computational efficiency. DGPL transforms causal learning into decomposed matrix products, capturing dynamic causal structure in high-dimensional data and improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that LOCAL significantly outperforms existing methods and highlight LOCAL's potential as a robust and efficient method for dynamic causal discovery.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |

While Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) offers a cheap and scalable alternative, transcription errors can lead to serious accessibility issues. Real-time correction of ASR by non-professionals presents an under-explored CART workflow that addresses these limitations. We conducted a user study with 75 participants to evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of this workflow. Complementary, we held focus groups with 25 DHH individuals to identify acceptable accuracy levels and factors affecting the accessibility of real-time captioning. Results suggest that collaborative editing can improve transcription accuracy to the extent that DHH users rate it positively regarding understandability. Focus groups also showed that human effort to improve captioning is highly valued, supporting a semi-automated approach as an alternative to stand-alone ASR and traditional CART services.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, to be published in Extended Abstracts of the CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI EA '25)</p></details> |

Practitioners and researchers alike are discovering new ways to replicate and enhance existing tourism experiences using virtual reality, yet few controlled experiments have studied how users perceive virtual tours of real-world locations. In this paper we present an initial exploration of a new system for virtual tourism, measuring the effects of real-time experiences and storytelling on presence, place attachment, and user memories of the destination. Our results suggest that narrative plays an important role in inducing presence within and attachment to the destination, while livestreaming can further increase place attachment while providing flexible, tailored experiences. We discuss the design and evaluation of our system, including feedback from our tourism partners, and provide insights into current limitations and further opportunities for virtual tourism.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by insights from the Topological Data Analysis (TDA) paradigm, of which real-world data exhibits multi-scale patterns, we construct several graphs using Persistent Homology Filtration -- a mathematical framework describing the multiscale structural properties of data points. Then, we use the constructed graphs as an input to create an ensemble of Graph Neural Networks. The ensemble aggregates the signals from the individual learners via an attention-based routing mechanism, thus systematically encoding the inherent multiscale structures of data. Four different real-world experiments on seismic activity prediction and traffic forecasting (PEMS-BAY, METR-LA) demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms single-graph baselines while providing interpretable insights.</p></details> |  |

The integration of hyperelasticity, non-interpenetration contact, and friction in real-time simulations presents formidable nonlinear and non-smooth problems, which are highly challenging to solve. By incorporating nonlinear complementarity conditions within the local-global framework, we achieve rapid convergence in addressing these challenges. While the structure of local-global methods is not fully GPU-friendly, our proposal of a simple yet efficient solver with sparse presentation of the system inverse enables highly parallel computing while maintaining a fast convergence rate. Moreover, our novel splitting strategy for non-smooth indicators not only amplifies overall performance but also refines the complementarity preconditioner, enhancing the accuracy of frictional behavior modeling. Through extensive experimentation, the robustness of our framework in managing real-time contact scenarios, ranging from large-scale systems and extreme deformations to non-smooth contacts and precise friction interactions, has been validated. Compatible with a wide range of hyperelastic models, our approach maintains efficiency across both low and high stiffness materials. Despite its remarkable efficiency, robustness, and generality, our method is elegantly simple, with its core contributions grounded solely on standard matrix operations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Iterative Trace Minimization for the Reconciliation of Very Short Hierarchical Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18550v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series often appear in an additive hierarchical structure. In such cases, time series on higher levels are the sums of their subordinate time series. This hierarchical structure places a natural constraint on forecasts. However, univariate forecasting techniques are incapable of ensuring this forecast coherence. An obvious solution is to forecast only bottom time series and obtain higher level forecasts through aggregation. This approach is also known as the bottom-up approach. In their seminal paper, \citep{Wickramasuriya2019} propose an optimal reconciliation approach named MinT. It tries to minimize the trace of the underlying covariance matrix of all forecast errors. The MinT algorithm has demonstrated superior performance to the bottom-up and other approaches and enjoys great popularity. This paper provides a simulation study examining the performance of MinT for very short time series and larger hierarchical structures. This scenario makes the covariance estimation required by MinT difficult. A novel iterative approach is introduced which significantly reduces the number of estimated parameters. This approach is capable of improving forecast accuracy further. The application of MinTit is also demonstrated with a case study at the hand of a semiconductor dataset based on data provided by the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS), a premier provider of semiconductor market data.</p></details> |  |

However, finding the initial stabilizing control depends on the known system model. To relax this requirement and achieve model-free optimal control, in this paper, two different reinforcement learning algorithms based on policy iteration and variable damping coefficients are designed for unknown discrete-time linear systems. First, a stable artificial system is designed, and this system is gradually iterated to the original system by varying the damping coefficients. This allows the initial stabilizing control to be obtained in a finite number of iteration steps. Then, an off-policy iteration algorithm and an off-policy $\mathcal{Q}$-learning algorithm are designed to select the appropriate damping coefficients and realize data-driven. In these two algorithms, the current estimates of optimal control gain are not applied to the system to re-collect data. Moreover, they are characterized by the fast convergence of the traditional policy iteration. Finally, the proposed algorithms are validated by simulation.</p></details> |  |

These lead to various peculiar phenomena, one of which being the piston effect where a sudden heating induces a mechanical pulse. The coupling between thermal and mechanical processes, in the linear approximation, yields a non-trivially rich thermoacoustics. The numerous applications of supercritical fluids raise the need for reliable yet fast and efficient numerical solution for thermoacoustic time and space dependence in this sensitive domain. Here, we present a second-order accurate, fully explicit staggered space-time grid finite difference method for such coupled linear thermoacoustic problems. Time integration is based on the splitting of the state space vector field representing the interactions that affect the dynamics into reversible and irreversible parts, which splitting procedure leads to decoupled wave and heat equations. The former is a hyperbolic partial differential equation, while the latter is a parabolic one, therefore, different time integration algorithms must be amalgamated to obtain a reliable, dispersion error-free, and dissipation error-free numerical solution. Finally, the thermoacoustic approximation of the supercritical piston effect is investigated via the developed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-to-Event Pretraining for 3D Medical Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09361v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of medical foundation models and the growing availability of imaging data, scalable pretraining techniques offer a promising way to identify imaging biomarkers predictive of future disease risk. While current self-supervised methods for 3D medical imaging models capture local structural features like organ morphology, they fail to link pixel biomarkers with long-term health outcomes due to a missing context problem. Current approaches lack the temporal context necessary to identify biomarkers correlated with disease progression, as they rely on supervision derived only from images and concurrent text descriptions. To address this, we introduce time-to-event pretraining, a pretraining framework for 3D medical imaging models that leverages large-scale temporal supervision from paired, longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs). Using a dataset of 18,945 CT scans (4.2 million 2D images) and time-to-event distributions across thousands of EHR-derived tasks, our method improves outcome prediction, achieving an average AUROC increase of 23.7% and a 29.4% gain in Harrell's C-index across 8 benchmark tasks. Importantly, these gains are achieved without sacrificing diagnostic classification performance. This study lays the foundation for integrating longitudinal EHR and 3D imaging data to advance clinical risk prediction.</p></details> | 34 pages, 19 figures |

Theoretical advancements so far often rely on stringent assumptions regarding the sparsity of the underlying signal. In non-sparse regimes, analyses have primarily focused on linear regression models with the design matrix having independent rows. In this paper, we expand the scope by investigating a high-dimensional time series model wherein the number of features grows proportionally to the number of sampling points, without assuming sparsity in the signal. Specifically, we consider the stochastic regression model and derive a single-letter formula for the normalized mutual information between observations and the signal, as well as for minimum mean-square errors. We also empirically study the vector approximate message passing VAMP algorithm and show that, despite the lack of theoretical guarantees, its performance for inference in our time series model is robust and often statistically optimal.</p></details> |  |

We propose a solution that leverages control theoretic tools to identify the dynamics of the parameters, predict their evolution, and ultimately compute a solution to the optimization problem. The identification of the dynamics of the time-varying parameters is done online using measurements of the gradient of the cost function. This system identification problem is not standard, since the output matrix is known and the dynamics of the parameters must be estimated in the original coordinates without similarity transformations. Interestingly, our analysis shows that, under mild conditions that we characterize, the identification of the parameters dynamics and, consequently, the computation of a time-varying solution to the optimization problem, requires only a finite number of measurements of the gradient of the cost function. We illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on a series of numerical examples.</p></details> |  |

Using the input-state trajectories of an expert agent, the proposed algorithms separately utilize control policy information and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation to estimate different sets of cost function parameters. This approach allows the algorithms to achieve broader applicability while maintaining a model-free framework. Also, the model-free algorithm reduces complexity compared to existing methods, as it requires solving a forward optimal control problem only once during initialization. Furthermore, in our partially model-free algorithm, this step can be bypassed entirely for systems with known input dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms, highlighting their potential for real-world deployment in autonomous systems and robotics.</p></details> |  |

Recent years, there are increasing interest of the data mining community to develop time series deep learning models to pursue better performance. The models performance often evaluate by certain evaluation metrics such as RMSE, Accuracy, and F1-score. Yet time series data are often hard to interpret and are collected with unknown environmental factors, sensor configuration, latent physic mechanisms, and non-stationary evolving behavior. As a result, a model that is better on standard metric-based evaluation may not always perform better in real-world tasks. In this blue sky paper, we aim to explore the challenge that exists in the metric-based evaluation framework for time series data mining and propose a potential blue-sky idea -- developing a knowledge-discovery-based evaluation framework, which aims to effectively utilize domain-expertise knowledge to evaluate a model. We demonstrate that an evidence-seeking explanation can potentially have stronger persuasive power than metric-based evaluation and obtain better generalization ability for time series data mining tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted in SIAM SDM 2025 - Blue Sky Track (to appear)</p></details> |

To tackle this challenging problem, we treat the schedulability analysis as a black box that only returns true/false results. We propose a general and scalable framework to optimize real-time systems, named Numerical Optimizer with Real-Time Highlight (NORTH). NORTH is built upon the gradient-based active-set methods from the numerical optimization literature but with new methods to manage active constraints for the non-differentiable schedulability constraints. In addition, we also generalize NORTH to NORTH+, to collaboratively optimize certain types of discrete variables (e.g., priority assignments, categorical variables) with continuous variables based on numerical optimization algorithms. We demonstrate the algorithm performance with two example applications: energy minimization based on dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), and optimization of control system performance. In these experiments, NORTH achieved $10^2$ to $10^5$ times speed improvements over state-of-the-art methods while maintaining similar or better solution quality. NORTH+ outperforms NORTH by 30% with similar algorithm scalability. Both NORTH and NORTH+ support black-box schedulability analysis, ensuring broad applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extension of a conference paper</p></details> |

To better simulate these conditions, physically-based NeRF rendering methods have been explored for their ability to generate realistic scene representations. However, these methods suffer from slow rendering speeds and long preprocessing times, making them impractical for real-time testing and user interaction. This paper presents ClimateGS, a novel framework integrating 3D Gaussian representations with physical simulation to enable real-time climate effects rendering. The novelty of this work is threefold: 1) developing a linear transformation for 3D Gaussian photorealistic style transfer, enabling direct modification of spherical harmonics across bands for efficient and consistent style adaptation; 2) developing a joint training strategy for 3D style transfer, combining supervised and self-supervised learning to accelerate convergence while preserving original scene details; 3) developing a real-time rendering method for climate simulation, integrating physics-based effects with 3D Gaussian to achieve efficient and realistic rendering. We evaluate ClimateGS on MipNeRF360 and Tanks and Temples, demonstrating real-time rendering with comparable or superior visual quality to SOTA 2D/3D methods, making it suitable for interactive applications.</p></details> |  |

A Survey and Outlook](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11835v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis (TSA) is a longstanding research topic in the data mining community and has wide real-world significance. Compared to "richer" modalities such as language and vision, which have recently experienced explosive development and are densely connected, the time-series modality remains relatively underexplored and isolated. We notice that many recent TSA works have formed a new research field, i.e., Multiple Modalities for TSA (MM4TSA). In general, these MM4TSA works follow a common motivation: how TSA can benefit from multiple modalities. This survey is the first to offer a comprehensive review and a detailed outlook for this emerging field. Specifically, we systematically discuss three benefits: (1) reusing foundation models of other modalities for efficient TSA, (2) multimodal extension for enhanced TSA, and (3) cross-modality interaction for advanced TSA. We further group the works by the introduced modality type, including text, images, audio, tables, and others, within each perspective. Finally, we identify the gaps with future opportunities, including the reused modalities selections, heterogeneous modality combinations, and unseen tasks generalizations, corresponding to the three benefits.

The intended use of this application is to assist midwives during routine home visits by offering real-time analysis and providing feedback based on collected data. The application integrates TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) and other Python-based algorithms within a Kotlin framework to process data in real-time. It is designed for use in low-resource settings, where traditional healthcare infrastructure may be lacking. The intended patient population includes pregnant women and new mothers in underserved areas and the developed system was piloted in rural Guatemala. This ML-based solution addresses the critical need for accessible and quality perinatal care by empowering healthcare providers with decision support tools to improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[No Vulnerability Data, No Problem: Towards Predicting Mean Time To Remediate In Open Source Software Dependencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17382v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timely remediation of vulnerabilities in software dependencies is critical for the security of the software supply chain. As such, researchers have proposed tools and metrics to help practitioners assess the security practices of each of their dependencies. Conceptually, a dependency-focused Mean-Time-To-Remediate (MTTR) metric can provide a historical perspective on how long it takes a given package to update vulnerable versions of its dependencies. However, existing MTTR metrics focus on a package fixing bugs in its own code, not its dependencies. Simultaneously, existing dependency update metrics do not aggregate values for the entire package and are not sensitive to aspects important for vulnerabilities (e.g., floating version constraints). The goal of this study is to aid industry practitioners, including developers, in assessing the risk of dependencies through a novel metric approximating mean-time-to-remediate vulnerabilities in their dependencies that is evaluated by an empirical study. We propose a novel algorithm for computing MTTR called $MTTR_{dep}$ and a companion metric called $Mean-Time-To-Update_{dep}$ ($MTTU_{dep}$), which considers all version updates, including vulnerability fix updates. We conduct a large-scale study using 163, 207 packages in npm, PyPI, and Cargo, of which only 22, 513 packages produce $MTTR_{dep}$ because of the lack of vulnerability data. We further study how package characteristics (e.g., contributors and version counts) influence $MTTU_{dep}$ and $MTTR_{dep}$ and explore how long packages retain outdated vulnerable dependencies in npm, PyPI, and Cargo. Our results indicate that industry practitioners can reliably use $MTTU_{dep}$ as a proxy for $MTTR_{dep}$ when available vulnerability data is insufficient.</p></details> |  |

However, most of these algorithms fail at high resolutions and require powerful hardware, limiting their deployment on edge devices. Motivated by this, we propose the first baseline for REal-Time High-resolution image INpainting on Edge Devices (RETHINED) that is able to inpaint at ultra-high-resolution and can run in real-time ($\leq$ 30ms) in a wide variety of mobile devices. A simple, yet effective novel method formed by a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recover structure, followed by a resolution-agnostic patch replacement mechanism to provide detailed texture. Specially our pipeline leverages the structural capacity of CNN and the high-level detail of patch-based methods, which is a key component for high-resolution image inpainting. To demonstrate the real application of our method, we conduct an extensive analysis on various mobile-friendly devices and demonstrate similar inpainting performance while being $\mathrm{100 \times faster}$ than existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthemore, we realease DF8K-Inpainting, the first free-form mask UHD inpainting dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[fabisearch: A Package for Change Point Detection in and Visualization of the Network Structure of Multivariate High-Dimensional Time Series in R](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02986v4)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Change point detection is a commonly used technique in time series analysis, capturing the dynamic nature in which many real-world processes function. With the ever increasing troves of multivariate high-dimensional time series data, especially in neuroimaging and finance, there is a clear need for scalable and data-driven change point detection methods. Currently, change point detection methods for multivariate high-dimensional data are scarce, with even less available in high-level, easily accessible software packages. To this end, we introduce the R package fabisearch, available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), which implements the factorized binary search (FaBiSearch) methodology. FaBiSearch is a novel statistical method for detecting change points in the network structure of multivariate high-dimensional time series which employs non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), an unsupervised dimension reduction and clustering technique. Given the high computational cost of NMF, we implement the method in C++ code and use parallelization to reduce computation time. Further, we also utilize a new binary search algorithm to efficiently identify multiple change points and provide a new method for network estimation for data between change points. We show the functionality of the package and the practicality of the method by applying it to a neuroimaging and a finance data set. Lastly, we provide an interactive, 3-dimensional, brain-specific network visualization capability in a flexible, stand-alone function. This function can be conveniently used with any node coordinate atlas, and nodes can be color coded according to community membership (if applicable). The output is an elegantly displayed network laid over a cortical surface, which can be rotated in the 3-dimensional space.</p></details> |  |
| **[The time scale of redundancy between prosody and linguistic context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11630v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In spoken language, speakers transmit information not only using words, but also via a rich array of non-verbal signals, which include prosody -- the auditory features of speech. However, previous studies have shown that prosodic features exhibit significant redundancy with both past and future words. Here, we examine the time scale of this relationship: How many words in the past (or future) contribute to predicting prosody? We find that this scale differs for past and future words. Prosody's redundancy with past words extends across approximately 3-8 words, whereas redundancy with future words is limited to just 1-2 words. These findings indicate that the prosody-future relationship reflects local word dependencies or short-scale processes such as next word prediction, while the prosody-past relationship unfolds over a longer time scale. The latter suggests that prosody serves to emphasize earlier information that may be challenging for listeners to process given limited cognitive resources in real-time communication. Our results highlight the role of prosody in shaping efficient communication.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, recently submitted to ACL.

We apply a model-free approach that relies neither on knowledge of model parameters nor on their estimations, and devise an RL algorithm to learn the optimal policy parameter directly. Our main contributions include the introduction of an exploration schedule and a regret analysis of the proposed algorithm. We provide the convergence rate of the policy parameter to the optimal one, and prove that the algorithm achieves a regret bound of $O(N^{\frac{3}{4}})$ up to a logarithmic factor, where $N$ is the number of learning episodes. We conduct a simulation study to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed algorithm. We also perform numerical comparisons between our method and those of the recent model-based stochastic LQ RL studies adapted to the state- and control-dependent volatility setting, demonstrating a better performance of the former in terms of regret bounds.</p></details> | 49 pages, 4 figures |

Recent data-driven strategies have shown promise for this challenging task, but the performance degradation they introduce during training has been a nonstarter for many production services, precluding adoption. This paper aims to bolster the practicality of data-driven rate control by presenting an alternative avenue for experiential learning: leveraging purely existing telemetry logs produced by the incumbent algorithm in production. We observe that these logs contain effective decisions, although often at the wrong times or in the wrong order. To realize this approach despite the inherent uncertainty that log-based learning brings (i.e., lack of feedback for new decisions), our system, Mowgli, combines a variety of robust learning techniques (i.e., conservatively reasoning about alternate behavior to minimize risk and using a richer model formulation to account for environmental noise). Across diverse networks (emulated and real-world), Mowgli outperforms the widely deployed GCC algorithm, increasing average video bitrates by 15-39% while reducing freeze rates by 60-100%.</p></details> |  |

TAMER introduces a framework where a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture is co-designed with Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) to jointly mitigate the intertwined challenges of patient heterogeneity and distribution shifts in EHR modeling. The MoE focuses on latent patient subgroups through domain-aware expert specialization, while TTA enables real-time adaptation to evolving health status distributions when new patient samples are introduced. Extensive experiments across four real-world EHR datasets demonstrate that TAMER consistently improves predictive performance for both mortality and readmission risk tasks when combined with diverse EHR modeling backbones. TAMER offers a promising approach for dynamic and personalized EHR-based predictions in practical clinical settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 7 tables.

| **[Dynamic Programming-Based Offline Redundancy Resolution of Redundant Manipulators Along Prescribed Paths with Real-Time Adjustment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17052v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional offline redundancy resolution of trajectories for redundant manipulators involves computing inverse kinematic solutions for Cartesian space paths, constraining the manipulator to a fixed path without real-time adjustments. Online redundancy resolution can achieve real-time adjustment of paths, but it cannot consider subsequent path points, leading to the possibility of the manipulator being forced to stop mid-motion due to joint constraints. To address this, this paper introduces a dynamic programming-based offline redundancy resolution for redundant manipulators along prescribed paths with real-time adjustment. The proposed method allows the manipulator to move along a prescribed path while implementing real-time adjustment along the normal to the path. Using Dynamic Programming, the proposed approach computes a global maximum for the variation of adjustment coefficients. As long as the coefficient variation between adjacent sampling path points does not exceed this limit, the algorithm provides the next path point's joint angles based on the current joint angles, enabling the end-effector to achieve the adjusted Cartesian pose. The main innovation of this paper lies in augmenting traditional offline optimal planning with real-time adjustment capabilities, achieving a fusion of offline planning and online planning.</p></details> |  |

When analyzing time series, we often seek to understand the underlying events occurring in the measured environment. For example, one might ask: What caused a sharp drop in the stock price? Events are often described with natural language, so we conduct the first study of whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can infer natural language events from time series. We curate a new benchmark featuring win probabilities collected from 4,200 basketball and American football games, featuring 1.7M timesteps with real value data and corresponding natural language events. Building on the recent wave of using LLMs on time series, we evaluate 16 LLMs and find that they demonstrate promising abilities to infer events from time series data. The open-weights DeepSeek-R1 32B model outperforms proprietary models like GPT-4o. Despite this impressive initial performance, we also find clear avenues to improve recent models, as we identify failures when altering the provided context, event sequence lengths, and evaluation strategy.

| **[Variable Time-Step MPC for Agile Multi-Rotor UAV Interception of Dynamic Targets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14184v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agile trajectory planning can improve the efficiency of multi-rotor Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in scenarios with combined task-oriented and kinematic trajectory planning, such as monitoring spatio-temporal phenomena or intercepting dynamic targets. Agile planning using existing non-linear model predictive control methods is limited by the number of planning steps as it becomes increasingly computationally demanding. That reduces the prediction horizon length, leading to a decrease in solution quality. Besides, the fixed time-step length limits the utilization of the available UAV dynamics in the target neighborhood. In this paper, we propose to address these limitations by introducing variable time steps and coupling them with the prediction horizon length. A simplified point-mass motion primitive is used to leverage the differential flatness of quadrotor dynamics and the generation of feasible trajectories in the flat output space. Based on the presented evaluation results and experimentally validated deployment, the proposed method increases the solution quality by enabling planning for long flight segments but allowing tightly sampled maneuvering.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate the capabilities of MLLMs in interpreting time and date through analogue clocks and yearly calendars. To facilitate this, we curated a structured dataset comprising two subsets: 1) $\textit{ClockQA}$, which comprises various types of clock styles$-$standard, black-dial, no-second-hand, Roman numeral, and arrow-hand clocks$-$paired with time related questions; and 2) $\textit{CalendarQA}$, which consists of yearly calendar images with questions ranging from commonly known dates (e.g., Christmas, New Year's Day) to computationally derived ones (e.g., the 100th or 153rd day of the year). We aim to analyse how MLLMs can perform visual recognition, numerical reasoning, and temporal inference when presented with time-related visual data. Our evaluations show that despite recent advancements, reliably understanding time remains a significant challenge for MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the ICLR 2025 Workshop on Reasoning and Planning for Large Language Models</p></details> |

Nevertheless, these models may be unreliable under distributional shifts, as their performance is significantly degraded. In this work, we explore how to efficiently leverage class text information to mitigate these distribution drifts encountered by large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) during test-time inference. In particular, we propose to generate pseudo-labels for the test-time samples by exploiting generic class text embeddings as fixed centroids of a label assignment problem, which is efficiently solved with Optimal Transport. Furthermore, the proposed adaptation method (CLIP-OT) integrates a multiple template knowledge distillation approach, which replicates multi-view contrastive learning strategies in unsupervised representation learning but without incurring additional computational complexity. Extensive experiments on multiple popular test-time adaptation benchmarks presenting diverse complexity empirically show the superiority of CLIP-OT, achieving performance gains of up to 7% over recent state-of-the-art methods, yet being computationally and memory efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added additional figures to communicate the algorithm</p></details> |

While fine-tuning and prompting methods can modify model behavior, they lack the dynamic and exact control necessary for engineering applications. Inference-time intervention techniques provide a promising alternative, allowing targeted adjustments to LLM outputs. In this work, we demonstrate how interventions enable fine-grained control for automating the usually time-intensive requirement verification process in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). Using two early-stage Capella SysML models of space missions with associated requirements, we apply the intervened LLMs to reason over a graph representation of the model to determine whether a requirement is fulfilled. Our method achieves robust and reliable outputs, significantly improving over both a baseline model and a fine-tuning approach. By identifying and modifying as few as one to three specialised attention heads, we can significantly change the model's behavior. When combined with self-consistency, this allows us to achieve perfect precision on our holdout test set.</p></details> |  |

These non-auto-regressive approaches involving different generative methods, including GAN, Diffusion, and Flow Matching for time series, have empirically demonstrated high-quality generation capability and accuracy. However, we still lack an appropriate understanding of how it processes approximation and generalization. This paper presents the first theoretical framework from the perspective of flow-based generative models to relieve the knowledge of limitations. In particular, we provide our insights with strict guarantees from three perspectives: $\textbf{Approximation}$, $\textbf{Generalization}$ and $\textbf{Efficiency}$. In detail, our analysis achieves the contributions as follows: $\bullet$ By assuming a general data model, the fitting of the flow-based generative models is confirmed to converge to arbitrary error under the universal approximation of Diffusion Transformer (DiT). $\bullet$ Introducing a polynomial-based regularization for flow matching, the generalization error thus be bounded since the generalization of polynomial approximation. $\bullet$ The sampling for generation is considered as an optimization process, we demonstrate its fast convergence with updating standard first-order gradient descent of some objective.</p></details> | 33 pages |

This is an essential task in a wide range of domains including weather forecasting, stock market analysis and disease outbreak prediction. Over the decades LTSF algorithms have transitioned from statistical models to deep learning models like transformer models. Despite the complex architecture of transformer based LTSF models `Are Transformers Effective for Time Series Forecasting? (Zeng et al., 2023)' showed that simple linear models can outperform the state-of-the-art transformer based LTSF models. Recently, quantum machine learning (QML) is evolving as a domain to enhance the capabilities of classical machine learning models. In this paper we initiate the application of QML to LTSF problems by proposing QuLTSF, a simple hybrid QML model for multivariate LTSF. Through extensive experiments on a widely used weather dataset we show the advantages of QuLTSF over the state-of-the-art classical linear models, in terms of reduced mean squared error and mean absolute error.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ICAART 2025</p></details> |

Recent approaches tackle this issue by actively labeling a small proportion of samples in each batch, yet the annotation burden quickly grows as the batch number increases. In this paper, we investigate how to achieve effortless active labeling so that a maximum of one sample is selected for annotation in each batch. First, we annotate the most valuable sample in each batch based on the single-step optimization perspective in the TTA context. In this scenario, the samples that border between the source- and target-domain data distributions are considered the most feasible for the model to learn in one iteration. Then, we introduce an efficient strategy to identify these samples using feature perturbation. Second, we discover that the gradient magnitudes produced by the annotated and unannotated samples have significant variations. Therefore, we propose balancing their impact on model optimization using two dynamic weights. Extensive experiments on the popular ImageNet-C, -R, -K, -A and PACS databases demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods with significantly lower annotation costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.Code:https://github.com/flash1803/EATTA</p></details> |

In practice, the coding speed of NVCs depends on 1) computational costs, and 2) non-computational operational costs, such as memory I/O and the number of function calls. While most efficient NVCs prioritize reducing computational cost, we identify operational cost as the primary bottleneck to achieving higher coding speed. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a set of efficiency-driven design improvements focused on minimizing operational costs. Specifically, we employ implicit temporal modeling to eliminate complex explicit motion modules, and use single low-resolution latent representations rather than progressive downsampling. These innovations significantly accelerate NVC without sacrificing compression quality. Additionally, we implement model integerization for consistent cross-device coding and a module-bank-based rate control scheme to improve practical adaptability. Experiments show our proposed DCVC-RT achieves an impressive average encoding/decoding speed at 125.2/112.8 fps (frames per second) for 1080p video, while saving an average of 21% in bitrate compared to H.266/VTM.

| **[Towards Neural Scaling Laws for Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12360v3)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling laws offer valuable insights into the design of time series foundation models (TSFMs). However, previous research has largely focused on the scaling laws of TSFMs for in-distribution (ID) data, leaving their out-of-distribution (OOD) scaling behavior and the influence of model architectures less explored. In this work, we examine two common TSFM architectures, encoder-only and decoder-only Transformers, and investigate their scaling behavior on both ID and OOD data. These models are trained and evaluated across varying parameter counts, compute budgets, and dataset sizes. Our experiments reveal that the log-likelihood loss of TSFMs exhibits similar scaling behavior in both OOD and ID settings. We further compare the scaling properties across different architectures, incorporating two state-of-the-art TSFMs as case studies, showing that model architecture plays a significant role in scaling. The encoder-only Transformers demonstrate better scalability than the decoder-only Transformers, while the architectural enhancements in the two advanced TSFMs primarily improve ID performance but reduce OOD scalability. While scaling up TSFMs is expected to drive performance breakthroughs, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of TSFM scaling laws has hindered the development of a robust framework to guide model scaling. We fill this gap in this work by synthesizing our findings and providing practical guidelines for designing and scaling larger TSFMs with enhanced model capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |

Previous methods speed up the models by caching and reusing model outputs at uniformly selected timesteps. However, such a strategy neglects the fact that differences among model outputs are not uniform across timesteps, which hinders selecting the appropriate model outputs to cache, leading to a poor balance between inference efficiency and visual quality. In this study, we introduce Timestep Embedding Aware Cache (TeaCache), a training-free caching approach that estimates and leverages the fluctuating differences among model outputs across timesteps. Rather than directly using the time-consuming model outputs, TeaCache focuses on model inputs, which have a strong correlation with the modeloutputs while incurring negligible computational cost. TeaCache first modulates the noisy inputs using the timestep embeddings to ensure their differences better approximating those of model outputs. TeaCache then introduces a rescaling strategy to refine the estimated differences and utilizes them to indicate output caching. Experiments show that TeaCache achieves up to 4.41x acceleration over Open-Sora-Plan with negligible (-0.07% Vbench score) degradation of visual quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025.

To address this issue, we propose YOLO-LLTS, an end-to-end real-time traffic sign detection algorithm specifically designed for low-light environments. Firstly, we introduce the High-Resolution Feature Map for Small Object Detection (HRFM-TOD) module to address indistinct small-object features in low-light scenarios. By leveraging high-resolution feature maps, HRFM-TOD effectively mitigates the feature dilution problem encountered in conventional PANet frameworks, thereby enhancing both detection accuracy and inference speed. Secondly, we develop the Multi-branch Feature Interaction Attention (MFIA) module, which facilitates deep feature interaction across multiple receptive fields in both channel and spatial dimensions, significantly improving the model's information extraction capabilities. Finally, we propose the Prior-Guided Enhancement Module (PGFE) to tackle common image quality challenges in low-light environments, such as noise, low contrast, and blurriness. This module employs prior knowledge to enrich image details and enhance visibility, substantially boosting detection performance. To support this research, we construct a novel dataset, the Chinese Nighttime Traffic Sign Sample Set (CNTSSS), covering diverse nighttime scenarios, including urban, highway, and rural environments under varying weather conditions. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that YOLO-LLTS achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the previous best methods by 2.7% mAP50 and 1.6% mAP50:95 on TT100K-night, 1.3% mAP50 and 1.9% mAP50:95 on CNTSSS, and achieving superior results on the CCTSDB2021 dataset.

However, these core-bound hardware mechanisms often lead to significant resource over-provisioning, and diminished real-time responsiveness, particularly in modern systems where tasks with varying reliability requirements are consolidated on shared processors to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and save power. To address these challenges, this work presents FlexStep, a systematic solution that integrates hardware and software across the SoC, ISA, and OS scheduling layers. FlexStep features a novel microarchitecture that supports dynamic core configuration and asynchronous, preemptive error detection. The FlexStep architecture naturally allows for flexible task scheduling and error detection, enabling new scheduling algorithms that enhance both resource efficiency and real-time schedulability.

Continuous time models enable us to properly provide scale-based time series models for irregularly-spaced observations for the first time, while also permitting a spectral representation of the process over a continuous range of scales. We derive results for both the theoretical setting, where we assume access to the entire process sample path, and a more practical one, which develops methods for estimating the quantities of interest from sampled time series. The latter estimates are accurately computable in reasonable time by solving the relevant linear integral equation using the iterative soft-thresholding algorithm due to Daubechies, Defrise and De~Mol. Appropriate smoothing techniques are also developed and applied in this new setting. Comparisons to previous methods are conducted on the heart rate time series of a sleeping infant. Additionally, we exemplify our new methods by computing spectral and autocovariance estimates on irregularly-spaced heart rate data obtained from a recent sleep-state study.</p></details> | 47 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Bayesian learning with Gaussian processes for low-dimensional representations of time-dependent nonlinear systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03455v3)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a data-driven method for learning low-dimensional time-dependent physics-based surrogate models whose predictions are endowed with uncertainty estimates. We use the operator inference approach to model reduction that poses the problem of learning low-dimensional model terms as a regression of state space data and corresponding time derivatives by minimizing the residual of reduced system equations. Standard operator inference models perform well with accurate training data that are dense in time, but producing stable and accurate models when the state data are noisy and/or sparse in time remains a challenge. Another challenge is the lack of uncertainty estimation for the predictions from the operator inference models. Our approach addresses these challenges by incorporating Gaussian process surrogates into the operator inference framework to (1) probabilistically describe uncertainties in the state predictions and (2) procure analytical time derivative estimates with quantified uncertainties. The formulation leads to a generalized least-squares regression and, ultimately, reduced-order models that are described probabilistically with a closed-form expression for the posterior distribution of the operators. The resulting probabilistic surrogate model propagates uncertainties from the observed state data to reduced-order predictions. We demonstrate the method is effective for constructing low-dimensional models of two nonlinear partial differential equations representing a compressible flow and a nonlinear diffusion-reaction process, as well as for estimating the parameters of a low-dimensional system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations representing compartmental models in epidemiology.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Sandialabs/GP-BayesOpInf</p></details> |
| **[Multi-modal Time Series Analysis: A Tutorial and Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13709v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal time series analysis has recently emerged as a prominent research area in data mining, driven by the increasing availability of diverse data modalities, such as text, images, and structured tabular data from real-world sources. However, effective analysis of multi-modal time series is hindered by data heterogeneity, modality gap, misalignment, and inherent noise. Recent advancements in multi-modal time series methods have exploited the multi-modal context via cross-modal interactions based on deep learning methods, significantly enhancing various downstream tasks. In this tutorial and survey, we present a systematic and up-to-date overview of multi-modal time series datasets and methods. We first state the existing challenges of multi-modal time series analysis and our motivations, with a brief introduction of preliminaries. Then, we summarize the general pipeline and categorize existing methods through a unified cross-modal interaction framework encompassing fusion, alignment, and transference at different levels (\textit{i.e.}, input, intermediate, output), where key concepts and ideas are highlighted. We also discuss the real-world applications of multi-modal analysis for both standard and spatial time series, tailored to general and specific domains. Finally, we discuss future research directions to help practitioners explore and exploit multi-modal time series.

| **[Temporal Encoding Strategies for Energy Time Series Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15456v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In contemporary power systems, energy consumption prediction plays a crucial role in maintaining grid stability and resource allocation enabling power companies to minimize energy waste and avoid overloading the grid. While there are several research works on energy optimization, they often fail to address the complexities of real-time fluctuations and the cyclic pattern of energy consumption. This work proposes a novel approach to enhance the accuracy of predictive models by employing sinusoidal encoding on periodic features of time-series data. To demonstrate the increase in performance, several statistical and ensemble machine learning models were trained on an energy demand dataset, using the proposed sinusoidal encoding. The performance of these models was then benchmarked against identical models trained on traditional encoding methods. The results demonstrated a 12.6% improvement of Root Mean Squared Error (from 0.5497 to 0.4802) and a 7.8% increase in the R^2 score (from 0.7530 to 0.8118), indicating that the proposed encoding better captures the cyclic nature of temporal patterns than traditional methods. The proposed methodology significantly improves prediction accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications in smart grid systems.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving high temporal coherence and diversity remains challenging. In this work, we explore temporal augmentation in video generation for the first time, and introduce FluxFlow for initial investigation, a strategy designed to enhance temporal quality. Operating at the data level, FluxFlow applies controlled temporal perturbations without requiring architectural modifications. Extensive experiments on UCF-101 and VBench benchmarks demonstrate that FluxFlow significantly improves temporal coherence and diversity across various video generation models, including U-Net, DiT, and AR-based architectures, while preserving spatial fidelity.

Cryptocurrencies are characterised by high market volatility and susceptibility to substantial crashes, issues that require temporal analysis methodologies able to tackle the high temporal resolution, heterogeneity and scale of blockchain data. While existing research attempts to analyse crash events, fundamental questions persist regarding the optimal time scale for analysis, differentiation between long-term and short-term trends, and the identification and characterisation of shock events within these decentralised systems. This paper addresses these issues by examining cryptocurrencies traded on the Ethereum blockchain, with a spotlight on the crash of the stablecoin TerraUSD and the currency LUNA designed to stabilise it. Utilising complex network analysis and a multi-layer temporal graph allows the study of the correlations between the layers representing the currencies and system evolution across diverse time scales. The investigation sheds light on the strong interconnections among stablecoins pre-crash and the significant post-crash transformations. We identify anomalous signals before, during, and after the collapse, emphasising their impact on graph structure metrics and user movement across layers. This paper pioneers temporal, cross-chain graph analysis to explore a cryptocurrency collapse. It emphasises the importance of temporal analysis for studies on web-derived data and how graph-based analysis can enhance traditional econometric results. Overall, this research carries implications beyond its field, for example for regulatory agencies aiming to safeguard users from shocks and monitor investment risks for citizens and clients.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear Transactions on Web</p></details> |

Recent efforts typically adopt the Masked Video Modeling (MVM) paradigm, leading to significant progress on multiple video tasks. However, two critical challenges remain: 1) Without human annotations, the random temporal sampling introduces uncertainty, increasing the difficulty of model training. 2) Previous MVM methods primarily recover the masked patches in the pixel space, leading to insufficient information compression for downstream tasks. To address these challenges jointly, we propose a self-supervised framework that leverages Temporal Correspondence for video Representation learning (T-CoRe). For challenge 1), we propose a sandwich sampling strategy that selects two auxiliary frames to reduce reconstruction uncertainty in a two-side-squeezing manner. Addressing challenge 2), we introduce an auxiliary branch into a self-distillation architecture to restore representations in the latent space, generating high-level semantic representations enriched with temporal information. Experiments of T-CoRe consistently present superior performance across several downstream tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness for video representation learning.

We introduce the task of one-shot medical video object segmentation, which requires separating foreground and background pixels throughout a video given only the mask annotation of the first frame. To address this problem, we propose a temporal contrastive memory network comprising image and mask encoders to learn feature representations, a temporal contrastive memory bank that aligns embeddings from adjacent frames while pushing apart distant ones to explicitly model inter-frame relationships and stores these features, and a decoder that fuses encoded image features and memory readouts for segmentation. We also collect a diverse, multi-source medical video dataset spanning various modalities and anatomies to benchmark this task. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in segmenting both seen and unseen structures from a single exemplar, showing ability to generalize from scarce labels. This highlights the potential to alleviate annotation burdens for medical video analysis. Code is available at https://github.com/MedAITech/TCMN.</p></details> | MICCAI 2024 Workshop |

By leveraging Knowledge Graphs (KGs), GraphRAG improves information retrieval for complex reasoning tasks, providing more precise and comprehensive retrieval and generating more accurate responses to QAs. However, most RAG methods fall short in addressing multi-step reasoning, particularly when both information extraction and inference are necessary. To address this limitation, this paper presents Knowledge Graph-Based Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-IRAG), a novel framework that integrates KGs with iterative reasoning to improve LLMs' ability to handle queries involving temporal and logical dependencies. Through iterative retrieval steps, KG-IRAG incrementally gathers relevant data from external KGs, enabling step-by-step reasoning. The proposed approach is particularly suited for scenarios where reasoning is required alongside dynamic temporal data extraction, such as determining optimal travel times based on weather conditions or traffic patterns. Experimental results show that KG-IRAG improves accuracy in complex reasoning tasks by effectively integrating external knowledge with iterative, logic-based retrieval. Additionally, three new datasets: weatherQA-Irish, weatherQA-Sydney, and trafficQA-TFNSW, are formed to evaluate KG-IRAG's performance, demonstrating its potential beyond traditional RAG applications.</p></details> | 14 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Temporal-Consistent Video Restoration with Pre-trained Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14863v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video restoration (VR) aims to recover high-quality videos from degraded ones. Although recent zero-shot VR methods using pre-trained diffusion models (DMs) show good promise, they suffer from approximation errors during reverse diffusion and insufficient temporal consistency. Moreover, dealing with 3D video data, VR is inherently computationally intensive. In this paper, we advocate viewing the reverse process in DMs as a function and present a novel Maximum a Posterior (MAP) framework that directly parameterizes video frames in the seed space of DMs, eliminating approximation errors. We also introduce strategies to promote bilevel temporal consistency: semantic consistency by leveraging clustering structures in the seed space, and pixel-level consistency by progressive warping with optical flow refinements. Extensive experiments on multiple virtual reality tasks demonstrate superior visual quality and temporal consistency achieved by our method compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

We create this dataset by training deep learning-based segmentation models to identify these renewable energy installations from satellite imagery, then deploy them on over 13 trillion pixels covering the world. For each detected feature, we estimate the construction date and the preceding land use type. This dataset offers crucial insights into progress toward sustainable development goals and serves as a valuable resource for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders aiming to assess and promote effective strategies for renewable energy deployment. Our final spatial dataset includes 375,197 individual wind turbines and 86,410 solar PV installations. We aggregate our predictions to the country level -- estimating total power capacity based on construction date, solar PV area, and number of windmills -- and find an $r^2$ value of $0.96$ and $0.93$ for solar PV and onshore wind respectively compared to IRENA's most recent 2023 country-level capacity estimates.</p></details> |  |
| **[SplatVoxel: History-Aware Novel View Streaming without Temporal Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14698v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of novel view streaming from sparse-view videos, which aims to generate a continuous sequence of high-quality, temporally consistent novel views as new input frames arrive. However, existing novel view synthesis methods struggle with temporal coherence and visual fidelity, leading to flickering and inconsistency. To address these challenges, we introduce history-awareness, leveraging previous frames to reconstruct the scene and improve quality and stability. We propose a hybrid splat-voxel feed-forward scene reconstruction approach that combines Gaussian Splatting to propagate information over time, with a hierarchical voxel grid for temporal fusion. Gaussian primitives are efficiently warped over time using a motion graph that extends 2D tracking models to 3D motion, while a sparse voxel transformer integrates new temporal observations in an error-aware manner. Crucially, our method does not require training on multi-view video datasets, which are currently limited in size and diversity, and can be directly applied to sparse-view video streams in a history-aware manner at inference time. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both static and streaming scene reconstruction, effectively reducing temporal artifacts and visual artifacts while running at interactive rates (15 fps with 350ms delay) on a single H100 GPU.

We present a new temporal consistency method where verifiers iteratively refine their judgments based on the previous assessment. Unlike one-round verification or multi-model debate approaches, our method leverages consistency in a sequence of self-reflection actions to improve verification accuracy. Empirical evaluations across diverse mathematical process error identification benchmarks (Mathcheck, ProcessBench, and PRM800K) show consistent performance improvements over baseline methods. When applied to the recent DeepSeek R1 distilled models, our method demonstrates strong performance, enabling 7B/8B distilled models to outperform all 70B/72B models and GPT-4o on ProcessBench. Notably, the distilled 14B model with our method achieves performance comparable to Deepseek-R1. Our codes are available at https://github.com/jcguo123/Temporal-Consistency</p></details> |  |
| **[Unifying Text Semantics and Graph Structures for Temporal Text-attributed Graphs with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14411v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) have shown remarkable performance in temporal graph modeling. However, real-world temporal graphs often possess rich textual information, giving rise to temporal text-attributed graphs (TTAGs). Such combination of dynamic text semantics and evolving graph structures introduces heightened complexity. Existing TGNNs embed texts statically and rely heavily on encoding mechanisms that biasedly prioritize structural information, overlooking the temporal evolution of text semantics and the essential interplay between semantics and structures for synergistic reinforcement. To tackle these issues, we present \textbf{{Cross}}, a novel framework that seamlessly extends existing TGNNs for TTAG modeling. The key idea is to employ the advanced large language models (LLMs) to extract the dynamic semantics in text space and then generate expressive representations unifying both semantics and structures. Specifically, we propose a Temporal Semantics Extractor in the {Cross} framework, which empowers the LLM to offer the temporal semantic understanding of node's evolving contexts of textual neighborhoods, facilitating semantic dynamics. Subsequently, we introduce the Semantic-structural Co-encoder, which collaborates with the above Extractor for synthesizing illuminating representations by jointly considering both semantic and structural information while encouraging their mutual reinforcement. Extensive experimental results on four public datasets and one practical industrial dataset demonstrate {Cross}'s significant effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> | Submit to ICML2025 |

However, acquiring diverse food items under varying conditions and generalizing to unseen food presents unique challenges. Existing methods that rely on surface-level geometric information (e.g., bounding box and pose) derived from visual cues (e.g., color, shape, and texture) often lacks adaptability and robustness, especially when foods share similar physical properties but differ in visual appearance. We employ imitation learning (IL) to learn a policy for food acquisition. Existing methods employ IL or Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a policy based on off-the-shelf image encoders such as ResNet-50. However, such representations are not robust and struggle to generalize across diverse acquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach, IMRL (Integrated Multi-Dimensional Representation Learning), which integrates visual, physical, temporal, and geometric representations to enhance the robustness and generalizability of IL for food acquisition. Our approach captures food types and physical properties (e.g., solid, semi-solid, granular, liquid, and mixture), models temporal dynamics of acquisition actions, and introduces geometric information to determine optimal scooping points and assess bowl fullness. IMRL enables IL to adaptively adjust scooping strategies based on context, improving the robot's capability to handle diverse food acquisition scenarios. Experiments on a real robot demonstrate our approach's robustness and adaptability across various foods and bowl configurations, including zero-shot generalization to unseen settings. Our approach achieves improvement up to $35\%$ in success rate compared with the best-performing baseline. More details can be found on our website https://ruiiu.github.io/imrl.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Infant Language Acquisition Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14341v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the words that a child is going to learn next can be useful for boosting language acquisition, and such predictions have been shown to be possible with both neural network techniques (looking at changes in the vocabulary state over time) and graph model (looking at data pertaining to the relationships between words). However, these models do not fully capture the complexity of the language learning process of an infant when used in isolation. In this paper, we examine how a model of language acquisition for infants and young children can be constructed and adapted for use in a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCN), taking into account the different types of linguistic relationships that occur during child language learning. We introduce a novel approach for predicting child vocabulary acquisition, and evaluate the efficacy of such a model with respect to the different types of linguistic relationships that occur during language acquisition, resulting in insightful observations on model calibration and norm selection. An evaluation of this model found that the mean accuracy of models for predicting new words when using sensorimotor relationships (0.733) and semantic relationships (0.729) were found to be superior to that observed with a 2-layer Feed-forward neural network. Furthermore, the high recall for some relationships suggested that some relationships (e.g. visual) were superior in identifying a larger proportion of relevant words that a child should subsequently learn than others (such as auditory).</p></details> |  |
| **[VSTAR: Generative Temporal Nursing for Longer Dynamic Video Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13501v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite tremendous progress in the field of text-to-video (T2V) synthesis, open-sourced T2V diffusion models struggle to generate longer videos with dynamically varying and evolving content. They tend to synthesize quasi-static videos, ignoring the necessary visual change-over-time implied in the text prompt. At the same time, scaling these models to enable longer, more dynamic video synthesis often remains computationally intractable. To address this challenge, we introduce the concept of Generative Temporal Nursing (GTN), where we aim to alter the generative process on the fly during inference to improve control over the temporal dynamics and enable generation of longer videos. We propose a method for GTN, dubbed VSTAR, which consists of two key ingredients: 1) Video Synopsis Prompting (VSP) - automatic generation of a video synopsis based on the original single prompt leveraging LLMs, which gives accurate textual guidance to different visual states of longer videos, and 2) Temporal Attention Regularization (TAR) - a regularization technique to refine the temporal attention units of the pre-trained T2V diffusion models, which enables control over the video dynamics. We experimentally showcase the superiority of the proposed approach in generating longer, visually appealing videos over existing open-sourced T2V models. We additionally analyze the temporal attention maps realized with and without VSTAR, demonstrating the importance of applying our method to mitigate neglect of the desired visual change over time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025.

To support downstream tasks like autonomous control, these representations must be both compositional and temporally consistent. Existing approaches based on recurrent processing often lack long-term stability across frames because their training objective does not enforce temporal consistency. In this work, we introduce a novel object-level temporal contrastive loss for video object-centric models that explicitly promotes temporal consistency. Our method significantly improves the temporal consistency of the learned object-centric representations, yielding more reliable video decompositions that facilitate challenging downstream tasks such as unsupervised object dynamics prediction. Furthermore, the inductive bias added by our loss strongly improves object discovery, leading to state-of-the-art results on both synthetic and real-world datasets, outperforming even weakly-supervised methods that leverage motion masks as additional cues.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at CVPR 2025</p></details> |

However, they struggle to perform spatio-temporal video grounding. This limitation stems from two major challenges. Firstly, it is difficult to extract accurate spatio-temporal information of each frame in the video. Secondly, the substantial number of visual tokens makes it challenging to precisely map visual tokens of each frame to their corresponding spatial coordinates. To address these issues, we introduce SpaceVLLM, a MLLM endowed with spatio-temporal video grounding capability. Specifically, we adopt a set of interleaved Spatio-Temporal Aware Queries to capture temporal perception and dynamic spatial information. Moreover, we propose a Query-Guided Space Decoder to establish a corresponding connection between the queries and spatial coordinates. Additionally, due to the lack of spatio-temporal datasets, we construct the Unified Spatio-Temporal Grounding (Uni-STG) dataset, comprising 480K instances across three tasks. This dataset fully exploits the potential of MLLM to simultaneously facilitate localization in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpaceVLLM achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 11 benchmarks covering temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal and video understanding tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Our code, datasets and model will be released.</p></details> |  |

Autonomous vehicles have come to increasingly interact with human drivers, and in many cases may pose risks to the physical or mental well-being of those they interact with. Meanwhile causal models, despite their inherent transparency and ability to offer contrastive explanations, have found limited usage within such systems. As such, we first identify the challenges that have limited the integration of structural causal models within autonomous vehicles. We then introduce a number of theoretical extensions to the structural causal model formalism in order to tackle these challenges. This augments these models to possess greater levels of modularisation and encapsulation, as well presenting temporal causal model representation with constant space complexity. We also prove through the extensions we have introduced that dynamically mutable sets (e.g. varying numbers of autonomous vehicles across time) can be used within a structural causal model while maintaining a relaxed form of causal stationarity. Finally we discuss the application of the extensions in the context of the autonomous vehicle and service robotics domain along with potential directions for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 Pa...</summary><p>30 Pages = 13 Pages (Main Content) + 4 Pages (References) + 13 Pages (Appendix), 15 Figures = 5 Figures (Main Content) + 10 (Appendix), To be published in the Proceedings of the 2025 Causal Learning and Reasoning Conference, Update upload of accepted paper version</p></details> |

In this work, we bring to light that current egocentric video question-answering datasets often include questions that can be answered using only few frames or commonsense reasoning, without being necessarily grounded in the actual video. Our analysis shows that state-of-the-art Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on these benchmarks achieve remarkably high performance using just text or a single frame as input. To address these limitations, we introduce EgoTempo, a dataset specifically designed to evaluate temporal understanding in the egocentric domain. EgoTempo emphasizes tasks that require integrating information across the entire video, ensuring that models would need to rely on temporal patterns rather than static cues or pre-existing knowledge. Extensive experiments on EgoTempo show that current MLLMs still fall short in temporal reasoning on egocentric videos, and thus we hope EgoTempo will catalyze new research in the field and inspire models that better capture the complexity of temporal dynamics.

The synthesized videos are evaluated on mainly two aspects, lip-speech synchronization and image fidelity. Recent studies demonstrate that GAN-based and diffusion-based models achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on this task, with diffusion-based models achieving superior image fidelity but experiencing lower synchronization compared to their GAN-based counterparts. To this end, we propose SyncDiff, a simple yet effective approach to improve diffusion-based models using a temporal pose frame with information bottleneck and facial-informative audio features extracted from AVHuBERT, as conditioning input into the diffusion process. We evaluate SyncDiff on two canonical talking head datasets, LRS2 and LRS3 for direct comparison with other SOTA models. Experiments on LRS2/LRS3 datasets show that SyncDiff achieves a synchronization score 27.7%/62.3% relatively higher than previous diffusion-based methods, while preserving their high-fidelity characteristics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Distortion Aware Omnidirectional Video Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11506v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omnidirectional video (ODV) provides an immersive visual experience and is widely utilized in virtual reality and augmented reality. However, restricted capturing devices and transmission bandwidth lead to low-resolution ODVs. Video super-resolution (SR) is proposed to enhance resolution, but practical ODV spatial projection distortions and temporal flickering are not well addressed directly applying existing methods. To achieve better ODV-SR reconstruction, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Distortion Aware Network (STDAN) oriented to ODV characteristics. Specifically, a spatially continuous distortion modulation module is introduced to improve discrete projection distortions. Next, we design an interlaced multi-frame reconstruction mechanism to refine temporal consistency across frames. Furthermore, we incorporate latitude-saliency adaptive weights during training to concentrate on regions with higher texture complexity and human-watching interest. In general, we explore inference-free and real-world viewing matched strategies to provide an application-friendly method on a novel ODV-SR dataset with practical scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed STDAN over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Robust Reactive Control with Signal Temporal Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05792v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signal Temporal Logic (STL) robustness is a common objective for optimal robot control, but its dependence on history limits the robot's decision-making capabilities when used in Model Predictive Control (MPC) approaches. In this work, we introduce Signal Temporal Logic robustness-to-go (Ro-To-Go), a new quantitative semantics for the logic that isolates the contributions of suffix trajectories. We prove its relationship to formula progression for Metric Temporal Logic, and show that the robustness-to-go depends only on the suffix trajectory and progressed formula. We implement robustness-to-go as the objective in an MPC algorithm and use formula progression to efficiently evaluate it online. We test the algorithm in simulation and compare it to MPC using traditional STL robustness. Our experiments show that using robustness-to-go results in a higher success rate.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-Centric Video Anomaly Detection Through Spatio-Temporal Pose Tokenization and Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15185v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) presents a significant challenge in computer vision, particularly due to the unpredictable and infrequent nature of anomalous events, coupled with the diverse and dynamic environments in which they occur. Human-centric VAD, a specialized area within this domain, faces additional complexities, including variations in human behavior, potential biases in data, and substantial privacy concerns related to human subjects. These issues complicate the development of models that are both robust and generalizable. To address these challenges, recent advancements have focused on pose-based VAD, which leverages human pose as a high-level feature to mitigate privacy concerns, reduce appearance biases, and minimize background interference. In this paper, we introduce SPARTA, a novel transformer-based architecture designed specifically for human-centric pose-based VAD. SPARTA introduces an innovative Spatio-Temporal Pose and Relative Pose (ST-PRP) tokenization method that produces an enriched representation of human motion over time. This approach ensures that the transformer's attention mechanism captures both spatial and temporal patterns simultaneously, rather than focusing on only one aspect. The addition of the relative pose further emphasizes subtle deviations from normal human movements. The architecture's core, a novel Unified Encoder Twin Decoders (UETD) transformer, significantly improves the detection of anomalous behaviors in video data. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPARTA consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in pose-based VAD.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches, including spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks (ST-GCNs), often face high memory demands and struggle to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies, limiting their efficiency in clinical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce DynSTG-Mamba (Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Graph Mamba), a novel framework that combines DF-STGNN and STG-Mamba to enhance motion sequence modeling. The DF-STGNN incorporates a dynamic spatio-temporal filter that adaptively adjusts spatial connections between skeletal joints and temporal interactions across different movement phases. This approach ensures better feature propagation through dynamic graph structures by considering the hierarchical nature and dynamics of skeletal gait data. Meanwhile, STG-Mamba, an extension of Mamba adapted for skeletal motion data, ensures a continuous propagation of states, facilitating the capture of long-term dependencies while reducing computational complexity. To reduce the number of model parameters and computational costs while maintaining consistency, we propose Cross-Graph Relational Knowledge Distillation, a novel knowledge transfer mechanism that aligns relational information between teacher (large architecture) and student models (small architecture) while using shared memory. This ensures that the interactions and movement patterns of the joints are accurately preserved in the motion sequences. We validate our DynSTG-Mamba on KOA-NM, PD-WALK, and ATAXIA datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by achieving in terms of Accuracy, F1-score, and Recall. Our results highlight the efficiency and robustness of our approach, offering a lightweight yet highly accurate solution for automated gait analysis and movement disorder assessment.</p></details> |  |

Despite delivering remarkable rendering quality and speed, existing methods struggle with storage demands and representing complex real-world motions. To tackle these issues, we propose MoDecGS, a memory-efficient Gaussian splatting framework designed for reconstructing novel views in challenging scenarios with complex motions. We introduce GlobaltoLocal Motion Decomposition (GLMD) to effectively capture dynamic motions in a coarsetofine manner. This approach leverages Global Canonical Scaffolds (Global CS) and Local Canonical Scaffolds (Local CS), extending static Scaffold representation to dynamic video reconstruction. For Global CS, we propose Global Anchor Deformation (GAD) to efficiently represent global dynamics along complex motions, by directly deforming the implicit Scaffold attributes which are anchor position, offset, and local context features. Next, we finely adjust local motions via the Local Gaussian Deformation (LGD) of Local CS explicitly. Additionally, we introduce Temporal Interval Adjustment (TIA) to automatically control the temporal coverage of each Local CS during training, allowing MoDecGS to find optimal interval assignments based on the specified number of temporal segments. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MoDecGS achieves an average 70% reduction in model size over stateoftheart methods for dynamic 3D Gaussians from realworld dynamic videos while maintaining or even improving rendering quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>The l...</summary><p>The last two authors are co-corresponding authors.

| **[Graph Discovery and Source Detection in Temporal Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13567v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers, policy makers, and engineers need to make sense of data on spreading processes as diverse as viral infections, water contamination, and misinformation in social networks. Classical questions include predicting infection behavior in a given network or deducing the structure of a network from infection data. We study two central problems in this area. In graph discovery, we aim to fully reconstruct the structure of a graph from infection data. In source detection, we observe a limited subset of the infections and aim to deduce the source of the infection chain. These questions have received considerable attention and have been analyzed in many settings (e.g., under different models of spreading processes), yet all previous work shares the assumption that the network has the same structure at every point in time. For example, if we consider how a disease spreads, it is unrealistic to assume that two people can either never or always infect each other, rather such an infection is possible precisely when they meet. Temporal graphs, in which connections change over time, have recently been used as a more realistic graph model to study infections. Despite this recent attention, we are the first to study graph discovery or source detection in temporal graphs. We propose models for temporal graph discovery and source detection that are consistent with previous work on static graphs and extend it to embrace the stronger expressiveness of temporal graphs. For this, we employ the standard susceptible-infected-resistant model of spreading processes, which is particularly often used to study diseases. We provide algorithms, lower bounds, and some experimental evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is my Master's thesis submitted at the Digital Engineering Faculty of the University of Potsdam on September 30, 2024.

Our approach applies query-based detection (DETR) to each frame and matches DETR queries to link the same person across frames. We introduce the Query Matching Module (QMM), which uses metric learning to bring queries for the same person closer together across frames compared to queries for different people. Action classes are predicted using the sequence of queries obtained from QMM matching, allowing for variable-length inputs from videos longer than a single clip. Experimental results on JHMDB, UCF101-24, and AVA datasets demonstrate that our method performs well for large position changes of people while offering superior computational efficiency and lower resource requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>exten...</summary><p>extended version of VISAPP2025</p></details> |
| **[VITED: Video Temporal Evidence Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12855v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate complex video question answering via chain-of-evidence reasoning -- identifying sequences of temporal spans from multiple relevant parts of the video, together with visual evidence within them. Existing models struggle with multi-step reasoning as they uniformly sample a fixed number of frames, which can miss critical evidence distributed nonuniformly throughout the video. Moreover, they lack the ability to temporally localize such evidence in the broader context of the full video, which is required for answering complex questions. We propose a framework to enhance existing VideoQA datasets with evidence reasoning chains, automatically constructed by searching for optimal intervals of interest in the video with supporting evidence, that maximizes the likelihood of answering a given question. We train our model (VITED) to generate these evidence chains directly, enabling it to both localize evidence windows as well as perform multi-step reasoning across them in long-form video content. We show the value of our evidence-distilled models on a suite of long video QA benchmarks where we outperform state-of-the-art approaches that lack evidence reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[STORM: A Spatio-Temporal Factor Model Based on Dual Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders for Financial Trading](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09468v3)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In financial trading, factor models are widely used to price assets and capture excess returns from mispricing. Recently, we have witnessed the rise of variational autoencoder-based latent factor models, which learn latent factors self-adaptively. While these models focus on modeling overall market conditions, they often fail to effectively capture the temporal patterns of individual stocks. Additionally, representing multiple factors as single values simplifies the model but limits its ability to capture complex relationships and dependencies. As a result, the learned factors are of low quality and lack diversity, reducing their effectiveness and robustness across different trading periods. To address these issues, we propose a Spatio-Temporal factOR Model based on dual vector quantized variational autoencoders, named STORM, which extracts features of stocks from temporal and spatial perspectives, then fuses and aligns these features at the fine-grained and semantic level, and represents the factors as multi-dimensional embeddings. The discrete codebooks cluster similar factor embeddings, ensuring orthogonality and diversity, which helps distinguish between different factors and enables factor selection in financial trading. To show the performance of the proposed factor model, we apply it to two downstream experiments: portfolio management on two stock datasets and individual trading tasks on six specific stocks. The extensive experiments demonstrate STORM's flexibility in adapting to downstream tasks and superior performance over baseline models.</p></details> |  |
| **[R3-Avatar: Record and Retrieve Temporal Codebook for Reconstructing Photorealistic Human Avatars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12751v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present R3-Avatar, incorporating a temporal codebook, to overcome the inability of human avatars to be both animatable and of high-fidelity rendering quality. Existing video-based reconstruction of 3D human avatars either focuses solely on rendering, lacking animation support, or learns a pose-appearance mapping for animating, which degrades under limited training poses or complex clothing. In this paper, we adopt a "record-retrieve-reconstruct" strategy that ensures high-quality rendering from novel views while mitigating degradation in novel poses. Specifically, disambiguating timestamps record temporal appearance variations in a codebook, ensuring high-fidelity novel-view rendering, while novel poses retrieve corresponding timestamps by matching the most similar training poses for augmented appearance. Our R3-Avatar outperforms cutting-edge video-based human avatar reconstruction, particularly in overcoming visual quality degradation in extreme scenarios with limited training human poses and complex clothing.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Consistency of Video Large Language Models in Temporal Comprehension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12951v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video large language models (Video-LLMs) can temporally ground language queries and retrieve video moments. Yet, such temporal comprehension capabilities are neither well-studied nor understood. So we conduct a study on prediction consistency -- a key indicator for robustness and trustworthiness of temporal grounding. After the model identifies an initial moment within the video content, we apply a series of probes to check if the model's responses align with this initial grounding as an indicator of reliable comprehension. Our results reveal that current Video-LLMs are sensitive to variations in video contents, language queries, and task settings, unveiling severe deficiencies in maintaining consistency. We further explore common prompting and instruction-tuning methods as potential solutions, but find that their improvements are often unstable. To that end, we propose event temporal verification tuning that explicitly accounts for consistency, and demonstrate significant improvements for both grounding and consistency. Our data and code are open-sourced at https://github.com/minjoong507/Consistency-of-Video-LLM.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR'25 |

To address this, we propose $\textbf{ReTaKe}$, a training-free method with two novel modules DPSelect and PivotKV, to jointly reduce both temporal visual redundancy and knowledge redundancy for video compression. To align with the way of human temporal perception, DPSelect identifies keyframes based on inter-frame distance peaks. To leverage LLMs' learned prior knowledge, PivotKV marks the keyframes as pivots and compress non-pivot frames by pruning low-attention tokens in their KV cache. ReTaKe enables VideoLLMs to process 8 times longer frames (up to 2048), outperforming similar-sized models by 3-5% and even rivaling much larger ones on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench, and LVBench. Moreover, by overlapping compression operations with prefilling, ReTaKe introduces only ~10% prefilling latency overhead while reducing decoding latency by ~20%. Our code is available at https://github.com/SCZwangxiao/video-ReTaKe.</p></details> | <details><summary>Rewri...</summary><p>Rewrite the methods section.

| **[CurveFormer++: 3D Lane Detection by Curve Propagation with Temporal Curve Queries and Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06423v2)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving, accurate 3D lane detection using monocular cameras is important for downstream tasks. Recent CNN and Transformer approaches usually apply a two-stage model design. The first stage transforms the image feature from a front image into a bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Subsequently, a sub-network processes the BEV feature to generate the 3D detection results. However, these approaches heavily rely on a challenging image feature transformation module from a perspective view to a BEV representation. In our work, we present CurveFormer++, a single-stage Transformer-based method that does not require the view transform module and directly infers 3D lane results from the perspective image features. Specifically, our approach models the 3D lane detection task as a curve propagation problem, where each lane is represented by a curve query with a dynamic and ordered anchor point set. By employing a Transformer decoder, the model can iteratively refine the 3D lane results. A curve cross-attention module is introduced to calculate similarities between image features and curve queries. To handle varying lane lengths, we employ context sampling and anchor point restriction techniques to compute more relevant image features. Furthermore, we apply a temporal fusion module that incorporates selected informative sparse curve queries and their corresponding anchor point sets to leverage historical information. In the experiments, we evaluate our approach on two publicly real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that our method provides outstanding performance compared with both CNN and Transformer based methods. We also conduct ablation studies to analyze the impact of each component.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.07989</p></details> |

Our model flexibly accommodates variations in tail heaviness and asymmetry at each data point while maintaining interpretability similar to normal distribution models. Notably, it is closed under linear transformations and provides explicit analytical expressions for skewness and kurtosis. The proposed model is applied to spatial and temporal data analysis, demonstrating that its properties vary based on the chosen matrix decomposition approach. To facilitate efficient inference, we develop a Bayesian estimation method using data augmentation, which is particularly effective for temporal models. Simulation studies confirm that accounting for heterogeneity in higher-order moments enhances parameter estimation accuracy and predictive performance. To illustrate real-world applicability, we analyze production functions across U.S. states. The results indicate that our model effectively captures heterogeneity in higher-order moments, leading to superior model fit in empirical data analysis.</p></details> |  |

Such noise can cause label quality to improve, worsen, or periodically change over time. We first propose and formalize temporal label noise, an unstudied problem for sequential classification of time series. In this setting, multiple labels are recorded over time while being corrupted by a time-dependent noise function. We first demonstrate the importance of modeling the temporal nature of the label noise function and how existing methods will consistently underperform. We then propose methods to train noise-tolerant classifiers by estimating the temporal label noise function directly from data. We show that our methods lead to state-of-the-art performance under diverse types of temporal label noise on real-world datasets</p></details> | <details><summary>The T...</summary><p>The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |

Accurate and early diagnosis of ASD is crucial for effective intervention, which is enhanced by richer representations of brain activity. The brain functional connectome, which refers to the statistical relationships between different brain regions measured through neuroimaging, provides crucial insights into brain function. Traditional static methods often fail to capture the dynamic nature of brain activity, in contrast, dynamic brain connectome analysis provides a more comprehensive view by capturing the temporal variations in the brain. We propose BrainTWT, a novel dynamic network embedding approach that captures temporal evolution of the brain connectivity over time and considers also the dynamics between different temporal network snapshots. BrainTWT employs temporal random walks to capture dynamics across different temporal network snapshots and leverages the Transformer's ability to model long term dependencies in sequential data to learn the discriminative embeddings from these temporal sequences using temporal structure prediction tasks. The experimental evaluation, utilizing the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) dataset, demonstrates that BrainTWT outperforms baseline methods in ASD classification.</p></details> |  |

It is a multimodal task aimed at localizing specific subjects spatio-temporally based on textual queries without bounding box supervision. Motivated by recent advancements in multi-modal foundation models for grounding tasks, we first explore the potential of state-of-the-art object detection models for WSTVG. Despite their robust zero-shot capabilities, our adaptation reveals significant limitations, including inconsistent temporal predictions, inadequate understanding of complex queries, and challenges in adapting to difficult scenarios. We propose CoSPaL (Contextual Self-Paced Learning), a novel approach which is designed to overcome these limitations. CoSPaL integrates three core components: (1) Tubelet Phrase Grounding (TPG), which introduces spatio-temporal prediction by linking textual queries to tubelets; (2) Contextual Referral Grounding (CRG), which improves comprehension of complex queries by extracting contextual information to refine object identification over time; and (3) Self-Paced Scene Understanding (SPS), a training paradigm that progressively increases task difficulty, enabling the model to adapt to complex scenarios by transitioning from coarse to fine-grained understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR'...</summary><p>ICLR'25 Main Conference.

Toward this goal, we introduce an audio-to-video generation framework for creating Real Time/cine-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (RT-/cine-MRI) visuals of the vocal tract from speech signals. Our framework first preprocesses RT-/cine-MRI sequences and speech samples to achieve temporal alignment, ensuring synchronization between visual and audio data. We then employ a modified stable diffusion model, integrating structural and temporal blocks, to effectively capture movement characteristics and temporal dynamics in the synchronized data. This process enables the generation of MRI sequences from new speech inputs, improving the conversion of audio into visual data. We evaluated our framework on healthy controls and tongue cancer patients by analyzing and comparing the vocal tract movements in synthesized videos. Our framework demonstrated adaptability to new speech inputs and effective generalization. In addition, positive human evaluations confirmed its effectiveness, with realistic and accurate visualizations, suggesting its potential for outpatient therapy and personalized simulation of vocal tract visualizations.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate our approach on both a public and private dataset, and demonstrate significant improvements in Mitral Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (MAPSE) calculations and overall landmark tracking stability. The method achieves a mean absolute MAPSE error of 1.81 $\pm$ 0.14 mm, an annulus size error of 2.46 $\pm$ 0.31 mm, and a landmark localization error of 2.48 $\pm$ 0.07 mm.

To address this, numerous temporal graph neural networks (temporal GNNs) and benchmark datasets have been developed. However, these datasets often feature excessive repeated edges and lack complex sequential dynamics, a key characteristic inherent in many real-world applications such as recommender systems and ``Who-To-Follow'' on social networks. This oversight has led existing methods to inadvertently downplay the importance of learning sequential dynamics, focusing primarily on predicting repeated edges. In this study, we demonstrate that existing methods, such as GraphMixer and DyGFormer, are inherently incapable of learning simple sequential dynamics, such as ``a user who has followed OpenAI and Anthropic is more likely to follow AI at Meta next.'' Motivated by this issue, we introduce the Temporal Graph Benchmark with Sequential Dynamics (TGB-Seq), a new benchmark carefully curated to minimize repeated edges, challenging models to learn sequential dynamics and generalize to unseen edges. TGB-Seq comprises large real-world datasets spanning diverse domains, including e-commerce interactions, movie ratings, business reviews, social networks, citation networks and web link networks. Benchmarking experiments reveal that current methods usually suffer significant performance degradation and incur substantial training costs on TGB-Seq, posing new challenges and opportunities for future research.

To tackle this task, it is crucial to learn the temporal interactions between objects in addition to their spatial relations. Due to the lack of explicitly annotated temporal relations in current benchmark datasets, most of the existing spatial-temporal scene graph generation methods build dense and abstract temporal connections among all objects across frames. However, not all temporal connections are encoding meaningful temporal dynamics. We propose a novel spatial-temporal scene graph generation method that selectively builds temporal connections only between temporal-relevant objects pairs and represents the temporal relations as explicit edges in the scene graph. The resulting sparse and explicit temporal representation allows us to improve upon strong scene graph generation baselines by up to $4.4\%$ in Scene Graph Detection. In addition, we show that our approach can be leveraged to improve downstream vision tasks. Particularly, applying our approach to action recognition, shows 0.6\% gain in mAP in comparison to the state-of-the-art</p></details> |  |

A common solution involves long-term temporal LiDAR data to densify the inputs. However, efficiently leveraging spatial-temporal information remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Semantic-Supervised Spatial-Temporal Fusion (ST-Fusion) method, which introduces a novel fusion module to relieve the spatial misalignment caused by the object motion over time and a feature-level semantic supervision to sufficiently unlock the capacity of the proposed fusion module. Specifically, the ST-Fusion consists of a Spatial Aggregation (SA) module and a Temporal Merging (TM) module. The SA module employs a convolutional layer with progressively expanding receptive fields to aggregate the object features from the local regions to alleviate the spatial misalignment, the TM module dynamically extracts object features from the preceding frames based on the attention mechanism for a comprehensive sequential presentation. Besides, in the semantic supervision, we propose a Semantic Injection method to enrich the sparse LiDAR data via injecting the point-wise semantic labels, using it for training a teacher model and providing a reconstruction target at the feature level supervised by the proposed object-aware loss. Extensive experiments on various LiDAR-based detectors demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of our proposal, yielding an improvement of approximately +2.8% in NDS based on the nuScenes benchmark.</p></details> | Accepted by ICRA2025 |

Such data occurs widely, ranging from the scientific and medical domains to the industrial and environmental domains. When the properties in time series exhibit spatial variations, we often call the data spatio-temporal. As part of the continued digitalization of processes throughout society, increasingly large volumes of time series and spatio-temporal data are available. In this tutorial, we focus on data-driven decision making with such data, e.g., enabling greener and more efficient transportation based on traffic time series forecasting. The tutorial adopts the holistic paradigm of "data-governance-analytics-decision." We first introduce the data foundation of time series and spatio-temporal data, which is often heterogeneous. Next, we discuss data governance methods that aim to improve data quality. We then cover data analytics, focusing on five desired characteristics: automation, robustness, generality, explainability, and resource efficiency. We finally cover data-driven decision making strategies and briefly discuss promising research directions. We hope that the tutorial will serve as a primary resource for researchers and practitioners who are interested in value creation from time series and spatio-temporal data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ICDE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Online Temporal Fusion for Vectorized Map Construction in Mapless Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00593v2)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To reduce the reliance on high-definition (HD) maps, a growing trend in autonomous driving is leveraging onboard sensors to generate vectorized maps online. However, current methods are mostly constrained by processing only single-frame inputs, which hampers their robustness and effectiveness in complex scenarios. To overcome this problem, we propose an online map construction system that exploits the long-term temporal information to build a consistent vectorized map. First, the system efficiently fuses all historical road marking detections from an off-the-shelf network into a semantic voxel map, which is implemented using a hashing-based strategy to exploit the sparsity of road elements. Then reliable voxels are found by examining the fused information and incrementally clustered into an instance-level representation of road markings. Finally, the system incorporates domain knowledge to estimate the geometric and topological structures of roads, which can be directly consumed by the planning and control (PnC) module. Through experiments conducted in complicated urban environments, we have demonstrated that the output of our system is more consistent and accurate than the network output by a large margin and can be effectively used in a closed-loop autonomous driving system.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |

The complexity arises from the intricate interactions between scales and the interplay of diverse physical processes. Neural operators have emerged as promising models for predicting such dynamics due to their flexibility and computational efficiency. However, they often fail to effectively capture multi-scale interactions or quantify the uncertainties inherent in the predictions. These limitations lead to rapid error accumulation, particularly in long-term forecasting of systems characterized by complex and coupled dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a spatio-temporal Fourier transformer (StFT), in which each transformer block is designed to learn dynamics at a specific scale. By leveraging a structured hierarchy of StFT blocks, the model explicitly captures dynamics across both macro- and micro- spatial scales. Furthermore, a generative residual correction mechanism is integrated to estimate and mitigate predictive uncertainties, enhancing both the accuracy and reliability of long-term forecasts. Evaluations conducted on three benchmark datasets (plasma, fluid, and atmospheric dynamics) demonstrate the advantages of our approach over state-of-the-art ML methods.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

However, can Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) also "reason through a sequential spatio-temporal logic" in videos? Existing Video-LLM benchmarks primarily focus on assessing object presence, neglecting relational reasoning. Consequently, it is difficult to measure whether a model truly comprehends object interactions (actions/events) in videos or merely relies on pre-trained "memory" of co-occurrences as biases in generating answers. In this work, we introduce a Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (V-STaR) benchmark to address these shortcomings. The key idea is to decompose video understanding into a Reverse Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (RSTR) task that simultaneously evaluates what objects are present, when events occur, and where they are located while capturing the underlying Chain-of-thought (CoT) logic. To support this evaluation, we construct a dataset to elicit the spatial-temporal reasoning process of Video-LLMs. It contains coarse-to-fine CoT questions generated by a semi-automated GPT-4-powered pipeline, embedding explicit reasoning chains to mimic human cognition. Experiments from 14 Video-LLMs on our V-STaR reveal significant gaps between current Video-LLMs and the needs for robust and consistent spatio-temporal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>A ben...</summary><p>A benchmark for Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning</p></details> |

In this framework, temporal predicates are encoded as polyhedron constraints on each edge of the network flow, instead of as constraints between the nodes as in the traditional Logic Tree formulation. Synthesized with Dynamic Network Flows, Logic Network Flows render a tighter convex relaxation compared to Logic Trees derived from these STL specifications. Our formulation is evaluated on several multi-robot motion planning case studies. Empirical results demonstrate that our formulation outperforms Logic Tree formulation in terms of computation time for several planning problems. As the problem size scales up, our method still discovers better lower and upper bounds by exploring fewer number of nodes during the branch-and-bound process, although this comes at the cost of increased computational load for each node when exploring branches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025</p></details> |

Nevertheless, conventional Mamba-based models encounter significant challenges in accurately predicting stock time series, as they fail to adequately capture both the overarching market dynamics and the intricate interdependencies among individual stocks. To overcome these constraints, we introduce the Hierarchical Information-Guided Spatio-Temporal Mamba (HIGSTM) framework. HIGSTM introduces Index-Guided Frequency Filtering Decomposition to extract commonality and specificity from time series. The model architecture features a meticulously designed hierarchical framework that systematically captures both temporal dynamic patterns and global static relationships within the stock market. Furthermore, we propose an Information-Guided Mamba that integrates macro informations into the sequence selection process, thereby facilitating more market-conscious decision-making. Comprehensive experimental evaluations conducted on the CSI500, CSI800 and CSI1000 datasets demonstrate that HIGSTM achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods struggle with low signal-to-noise ratios and single-station reliance, limiting their effectiveness. We propose a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) using Spectral Structure Learning Convolution (Spectral SLC) to model static and dynamic relationships across seismic stations. Our approach processes multi-station waveform data and generates station-specific detection probabilities. Experiments show superior performance over a conventional GCN baseline in terms of true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR), highlighting its potential for robust multi-station earthquake detection.

However, existing approaches typically rely on paired ground truth, which limits their practicality and often fails to maintain temporal consistency. To overcome these obstacles, this paper introduces a novel zero-shot learning approach named Zero-TIG, leveraging the Retinex theory and optical flow techniques. The proposed network consists of an enhancement module and a temporal feedback module. The enhancement module comprises three subnetworks: low-light image denoising, illumination estimation, and reflection denoising. The temporal enhancement module ensures temporal consistency by incorporating histogram equalization, optical flow computation, and image warping to align the enhanced previous frame with the current frame, thereby maintaining continuity. Additionally, we address color distortion in underwater data by adaptively balancing RGB channels. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves low-light video enhancement without the need for paired training data, making it a promising and applicable method for real-world scenario enhancement.</p></details> |  |

Prior work primarily focuses on single-frame cooperative perception, which fuses agents' information across different spatial locations but ignores temporal cues and temporal tasks (e.g., temporal perception and prediction). In this paper, we focus on the spatio-temporal fusion in V2X scenarios and design one-step and multi-step communication strategies (when to transmit) as well as examine their integration with three fusion strategies - early, late, and intermediate (what to transmit), providing comprehensive benchmarks with 11 fusion models (how to fuse). Furthermore, we propose V2XPnP, a novel intermediate fusion framework within one-step communication for end-to-end perception and prediction. Our framework employs a unified Transformer-based architecture to effectively model complex spatio-temporal relationships across multiple agents, frames, and high-definition map. Moreover, we introduce the V2XPnP Sequential Dataset that supports all V2X collaboration modes and addresses the limitations of existing real-world datasets, which are restricted to single-frame or single-mode cooperation. Extensive experiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both perception and prediction tasks. The codebase and dataset will be released to facilitate future V2X research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website link: https://mobility-lab.seas.ucla.edu/v2xpnp/</p></details> |
| **[Graph Fourier Neural ODEs: Modeling Spatial-temporal Multi-scales in Molecular Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01600v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting long-horizon molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories remains a significant challenge, as existing deep learning methods often struggle to retain fidelity over extended simulations. We hypothesize that one key factor limiting accuracy is the difficulty of capturing interactions that span distinct spatial and temporal scales-ranging from high-frequency local vibrations to low-frequency global conformational changes. To address these limitations, we propose Graph Fourier Neural ODEs (GF-NODE), integrating a graph Fourier transform for spatial frequency decomposition with a Neural ODE framework for continuous-time evolution. Specifically, GF-NODE first decomposes molecular configurations into multiple spatial frequency modes using the graph Laplacian, then evolves the frequency components in time via a learnable Neural ODE module that captures both local and global dynamics, and finally reconstructs the updated molecular geometry through an inverse graph Fourier transform. By explicitly modeling high- and low-frequency phenomena in this unified pipeline, GF-NODE more effectively captures long-range correlations and local fluctuations alike. Experimental results on challenging MD benchmarks, including MD17 and alanine dipeptide, demonstrate that GF-NODE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while preserving essential geometrical features over extended simulations. These findings highlight the promise of bridging spectral decomposition with continuous-time modeling to improve the robustness and predictive power of MD simulations.</p></details> | Preprint |

While Transformer-based methods achieve high accuracy, their quadratic complexity hinders deployment in such scenarios. Given the recent popularity of linear complexity Mamba-based models, leveraging them for TAD is a natural choice. However, naively adapting Mamba from language or vision tasks fails to provide an optimal solution and does not address the challenges of long, untrimmed videos. Therefore, we propose Multi-Scale Temporal Mamba (MS-Temba), the first Mamba-based architecture specifically designed for densely labeled TAD tasks. MS-Temba features Temporal Mamba Blocks (Temba Blocks), consisting of Temporal Convolutional Module (TCM) and Dilated SSM (D-SSM). TCM captures short-term dependencies using dilated convolutions, while D-SSM introduces a novel dilated state-space mechanism to model long-range temporal relationships effectively at each temporal scale. These multi-scale representations are aggregated by Scale-Aware State Fuser, which learns a unified representation for detecting densely overlapping actions. Experiments show that MS-Temba achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-duration videos, remains competitive on shorter segments, and reduces model complexity by 88%. Its efficiency and effectiveness make MS-Temba well-suited for real-world edge deployment.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches mainly learn a policy to predict a distant next-best end-effector pose (NBP) and then compute the corresponding joint rotation angles for motion using inverse kinematics. However, they suffer from two important issues: (1) rarely considering the physical robotic structure, which may cause self-collisions or interferences, and (2) overlooking the kinematics constraint, which may result in the predicted poses not conforming to the actual limitations of the robot joints. In this paper, we propose Kinematics enhanced Spatial-TemporAl gRaph Diffuser (KStar Diffuser). Specifically, (1) to incorporate the physical robot structure information into action prediction, KStar Diffuser maintains a dynamic spatial-temporal graph according to the physical bimanual joint motions at continuous timesteps. This dynamic graph serves as the robot-structure condition for denoising the actions; (2) to make the NBP learning objective consistent with kinematics, we introduce the differentiable kinematics to provide the reference for optimizing KStar Diffuser. This module regularizes the policy to predict more reliable and kinematics-aware next end-effector poses. Experimental results show that our method effectively leverages the physical structural information and generates kinematics-aware actions in both simulation and real-world</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Our approach integrates visual and audio information through a multimodal framework. The visual branch uses a pre-trained ResNet model to extract spatial features from facial images. The audio branches employ pre-trained VGG models to extract VGGish and LogMel features from speech signals. These features undergo temporal modeling using Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs). We then apply cross-modal attention mechanisms, where visual features interact with audio features through query-key-value attention structures. Finally, the features are concatenated and passed through a regression layer to predict valence and arousal. Our method achieves competitive performance on the Aff-Wild2 dataset, demonstrating effective multimodal fusion for VA estimation in-the-wild.</p></details> |  |

Compared to classic STVG locating only a single target, OmniSTVG enables localization of not only an arbitrary number of text-referred targets but also their interacting counterparts in the query from the video, making it more flexible and practical in real scenarios for comprehensive understanding. In order to facilitate exploration of OmniSTVG, we introduce BOSTVG, a large-scale benchmark dedicated to OmniSTVG. Specifically, our BOSTVG consists of 10,018 videos with 10.2M frames and covers a wide selection of 287 classes from diverse scenarios. Each sequence in BOSTVG, paired with a free-form textual query, encompasses a varying number of targets ranging from 1 to 10. To ensure high quality, each video is manually annotated with meticulous inspection and refinement. To our best knowledge, BOSTVG is to date the first and the largest benchmark for OmniSTVG. To encourage future research, we introduce a simple yet effective approach, named OmniTube, which, drawing inspiration from Transformer-based STVG methods, is specially designed for OmniSTVG and demonstrates promising results. By releasing BOSTVG, we hope to go beyond classic STVG by locating every object appearing in the query for more comprehensive understanding, opening up a new direction for STVG. Our benchmark, model, and results will be released at https://github.com/JellyYao3000/OmniSTVG.</p></details> |  |

Despite the prevalence, PPG signals can be contaminated by motion artifacts induced from daily activities. Existing approaches mainly use the amplitude information to perform PPG peak detection. However, these approaches cannot accurately identify peaks, since motion artifacts may bring random and significant amplitude variations. To improve the performance of PPG peak detection, the time information can be used. Specifically, heart rates exhibit temporal consistency that consecutive heartbeat intervals in a normal person can have limited variations. To leverage the temporal consistency, we propose the Temporal Attentive U-Net, i.e., TAU, to accurately detect peaks from PPG signals. In TAU, we design a time module that encodes temporal consistency in temporal embeddings. We integrate the amplitude information with temporal embeddings using the attention mechanism to estimate peak labels. Our experimental results show that TAU outperforms eleven baselines on heart rate estimation by more than 22.4%. Our TAU model achieves the best performance across various Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) levels. Moreover, we achieve Pearson correlation coefficients higher than 0.9 (p < 0.01) on estimating HRV features from low-noise-level PPG signals.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, submitted to a journal</p></details> |

While large language models (LLMs) achieve unification through task-agnostic data and generation, existing visual generation models fail to meet these principles. Current approaches either rely on per-task datasets and large-scale training or adapt pre-trained image models with task-specific modifications, limiting their generalizability. In this work, we explore video models as a foundation for unified image generation, leveraging their inherent ability to model temporal correlations. We introduce RealGeneral, a novel framework that reformulates image generation as a conditional frame prediction task, analogous to in-context learning in LLMs. To bridge the gap between video models and condition-image pairs, we propose (1) a Unified Conditional Embedding module for multi-modal alignment and (2) a Unified Stream DiT Block with decoupled adaptive LayerNorm and attention mask to mitigate cross-modal interference. RealGeneral demonstrates effectiveness in multiple important visual generation tasks, e.g., it achieves a 14.5% improvement in subject similarity for customized generation and a 10% enhancement in image quality for canny-to-image task.

In this paper, we rethink that the redundancy in inversion-based image editing exists in both the spatial and temporal dimensions, such as the unnecessary computation in unedited regions and the redundancy in the inversion progress. To tackle these challenges, we propose a practical framework, named EEdit, to achieve efficient image editing. Specifically, we introduce three techniques to solve them one by one. For spatial redundancy, spatial locality caching is introduced to compute the edited region and its neighboring regions while skipping the unedited regions, and token indexing preprocessing is designed to further accelerate the caching. For temporal redundancy, inversion step skipping is proposed to reuse the latent for efficient editing. Our experiments demonstrate an average of 2.46 $\times$ acceleration without performance drop in a wide range of editing tasks including prompt-guided image editing, dragging and image composition.

Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, primarily based on graph neural networks (GNNs), encounter difficulties in capturing long-term, long-distance, and fine-grained interactions among heterogeneous player nodes, as well as in recognizing interaction patterns. Additionally, they exhibit limited generalization to untrained downstream tasks and zero-shot scenarios. In this work, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Propagation Symmetry-Aware Graph Transformer for fine-grained game modeling. This architecture explicitly captures delay effects in the spatial space to enhance player node representations across discrete-time slices, employing symmetry-invariant priors to guide the attention mechanism. We also introduce an efficient contrastive learning strategy to train a Mixture of Tactics Experts module, facilitating differentiated modeling of offensive tactics. By integrating dense training with sparse inference, we achieve a 2.4x improvement in model efficiency. Moreover, the incorporation of Lightweight Graph Grounding for Large Language Models enables robust performance in open-ended downstream tasks and zero-shot scenarios, including novel teams or players. The proposed model, TacticExpert, delineates a vertically integrated large model framework for basketball, unifying pretraining across multiple datasets and downstream prediction tasks. Fine-grained modeling modules significantly enhance spatial-temporal representations, and visualization analyzes confirm the strong interpretability of the model.</p></details> |  |

Effective utilization of temporal information is crucial for SNNs, leading to the exploration of attention mechanisms to enhance this capability. Conventional attention operations either apply identical operation or employ non-identical operations across target dimensions. We identify that these approaches provide distinct perspectives on temporal information. To leverage the strengths of both operations, we propose a novel Dual Temporal-channel-wise Attention (DTA) mechanism that integrates both identical/non-identical attention strategies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to concentrate on both the correlation and dependency of temporal-channel using both identical and non-identical attention operations. Experimental results demonstrate that the DTA mechanism achieves state-of-the-art performance on both static datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet-1k) and dynamic dataset (CIFAR10-DVS), elevating spike representation and capturing complex temporal-channel relationship.

To address this limitation, we curate a dedicated instruction fine-tuning dataset that focuses on enhancing temporal comprehension across five key dimensions. In order to reduce reliance on costly temporal annotations, we introduce a multi-task prompt fine-tuning approach that seamlessly integrates temporal-sensitive tasks into existing instruction datasets without requiring additional annotations. Furthermore, we develop a novel benchmark for temporal-sensitive video understanding that not only fills the gaps in dimension coverage left by existing benchmarks but also rigorously filters out potential shortcuts, ensuring a more accurate evaluation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the temporal understanding of video-LLMs while avoiding reliance on shortcuts.</p></details> |  |

A common strategy learns a world model and unrolls it step-by-step at inference, where small errors can rapidly compound. Geometric Horizon Models (GHMs) offer a compelling alternative by directly making predictions of future states, avoiding cumulative inference errors. While GHMs can be conveniently learned by a generative analog to temporal difference (TD) learning, existing methods are negatively affected by bootstrapping predictions at train time and struggle to generate high-quality predictions at long horizons. This paper introduces Temporal Difference Flows (TD-Flow), which leverages the structure of a novel Bellman equation on probability paths alongside flow-matching techniques to learn accurate GHMs at over 5x the horizon length of prior methods. Theoretically, we establish a new convergence result and primarily attribute TD-Flow's efficacy to reduced gradient variance during training. We further show that similar arguments can be extended to diffusion-based methods. Empirically, we validate TD-Flow across a diverse set of domains on both generative metrics and downstream tasks including policy evaluation. Moreover, integrating TD-Flow with recent behavior foundation models for planning over pre-trained policies demonstrates substantial performance gains, underscoring its promise for long-horizon decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[Complexity of Safety and coSafety Fragments of Linear Temporal Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14913v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) is the de-facto standard temporal logic for system specification, whose foundational properties have been studied for over five decades. Safety and cosafety properties define notable fragments of LTL, where a prefix of a trace suffices to establish whether a formula is true or not over that trace. In this paper, we study the complexity of the problems of satisfiability, validity, and realizability over infinite and finite traces for the safety and cosafety fragments of LTL. As for satisfiability and validity over infinite traces, we prove that the majority of the fragments have the same complexity as full LTL, that is, they are PSPACE-complete. The picture is radically different for realizability: we find fragments with the same expressive power whose complexity varies from 2EXPTIME-complete (as full LTL) to EXPTIME-complete. Notably, for all cosafety fragments, the complexity of the three problems does not change passing from infinite to finite traces, while for all safety fragments the complexity of satisfiability (resp., realizability) over finite traces drops to NP-complete (resp., ${\Pi}^P_2$-complete).</p></details> |  |

Currently, in the field of pig behavior recognition, the lack of publicly available behavioral datasets not only limits the development of innovative algorithms but also hampers model robustness and algorithm optimization.This paper proposes a dataset containing 13 pig behaviors that significantly impact welfare.Based on this dataset, this paper proposes a spatial-temporal perception and enhancement networks based on the attention mechanism to model the spatiotemporal features of pig behaviors and their associated interaction areas in video data. The network is composed of a spatiotemporal perception network and a spatiotemporal feature enhancement network. The spatiotemporal perception network is responsible for establishing connections between the pigs and the key regions of their behaviors in the video data. The spatiotemporal feature enhancement network further strengthens the important spatial features of individual pigs and captures the long-term dependencies of the spatiotemporal features of individual behaviors by remodeling these connections, thereby enhancing the model's perception of spatiotemporal changes in pig behaviors. Experimental results demonstrate that on the dataset established in this paper, our proposed model achieves a MAP score of 75.92%, which is an 8.17% improvement over the best-performing traditional model. This study not only improces the accuracy and generalizability of individual pig behavior recognition but also provides new technological tools for modern smart farming. The dataset and related code will be made publicly available alongside this paper.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have revealed that Large Language Models (LLMs), with their powerful in-contextual modeling capabilities, hold significant potential for TSF. However, existing LLM-based methods usually perform suboptimally because they neglect the inherent characteristics of time series data. Unlike the textual data used in LLM pre-training, the time series data is semantically sparse and comprises distinctive temporal patterns. To address this problem, we propose LLM-PS to empower the LLM for TSF by learning the fundamental \textit{Patterns} and meaningful \textit{Semantics} from time series data. Our LLM-PS incorporates a new multi-scale convolutional neural network adept at capturing both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends within the time series. Meanwhile, we introduce a time-to-text module for extracting valuable semantics across continuous time intervals rather than isolated time points. By integrating these patterns and semantics, LLM-PS effectively models temporal dependencies, enabling a deep comprehension of time series and delivering accurate forecasts. Intensive experimental results demonstrate that LLM-PS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short- and long-term forecasting tasks, as well as in few- and zero-shot settings.</p></details> |  |

Traditional deep learning approaches have significantly advanced this field, particularly in the stage of ST data mining. However, these models remain task-specific and often require extensive labeled data. Inspired by the success of Foundation Models (FM), especially large language models, researchers have begun exploring the concept of Spatio-Temporal Foundation Models (STFMs) to enhance adaptability and generalization across diverse ST tasks. Unlike prior architectures, STFMs empower the entire workflow of ST data science, ranging from data sensing, management, to mining, thereby offering a more holistic and scalable approach. Despite rapid progress, a systematic study of STFMs for ST data science remains lacking. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive review of STFMs, categorizing existing methodologies and identifying key research directions to advance ST general intelligence.</p></details> |  |

These methods process each sampled frame independently by the image encoder, resulting in high computational overhead and limiting practical deployment. Addressing this, we focus on efficient text-video retrieval by tackling two key challenges: 1. From the perspective of trainable parameters, current parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods incur high inference costs; 2. From the perspective of model complexity, current token compression methods are mainly designed for images to reduce spatial redundancy but overlook temporal redundancy in consecutive frames of a video. To tackle these challenges, we propose Temporal Token Merging (TempMe), a parameter-efficient and training-inference efficient text-video retrieval architecture that minimizes trainable parameters and model complexity. Specifically, we introduce a progressive multi-granularity framework. By gradually combining neighboring clips, we reduce spatio-temporal redundancy and enhance temporal modeling across different frames, leading to improved efficiency and performance. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our TempMe. Compared to previous parameter-efficient text-video retrieval methods, TempMe achieves superior performance with just 0.50M trainable parameters. It significantly reduces output tokens by 95% and GFLOPs by 51%, while achieving a 1.8X speedup and a 4.4% R-Sum improvement. With full fine-tuning, TempMe achieves a significant 7.9% R-Sum improvement, trains 1.57X faster, and utilizes 75.2% GPU memory usage.

Utilizing existing observations, spatio-temporal kriging is a method for estimating air quality at unobserved locations during a specific period. Inductive spatio-temporal kriging with increment training strategy has demonstrated its effectiveness using virtual nodes to simulate unobserved nodes. However, a disparity between virtual and real nodes persists, complicating the application of learning patterns derived from virtual nodes to actual unobserved ones. To address these limitations, this paper presents a Physics-Guided Increment Training Strategy (PGITS). Specifically, we design a dynamic graph generation module to incorporate the advection and diffusion processes of airborne particles as physical knowledge into the graph structure, dynamically adjusting the adjacency matrix to reflect physical interactions between nodes. By using physics principles as a bridge between virtual and real nodes, this strategy ensures the features of virtual nodes and their pseudo labels are closer to actual nodes. Consequently, the learned patterns of virtual nodes can be applied to actual unobserved nodes for effective kriging.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods struggle with retrieving cross-modal information from long videos, especially when relevant details are sparsely distributed. We introduce UMaT (Unified Multi-modal as Text), a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that efficiently processes extremely long videos while maintaining cross-modal coherence. UMaT converts visual and auditory data into a unified textual representation, ensuring semantic and temporal alignment. Short video clips are analyzed using a vision-language model, while automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcribes dialogue. These text-based representations are structured into temporally aligned segments, with adaptive filtering to remove redundancy and retain salient details. The processed data is embedded into a vector database, enabling precise retrieval of dispersed yet relevant content. Experiments on a benchmark LVQA dataset show that UMaT outperforms existing methods in multimodal integration, long-form video understanding, and sparse information retrieval. Its scalability and interpretability allow it to process videos over an hour long while maintaining semantic and temporal coherence. These findings underscore the importance of structured retrieval and multimodal synchronization for advancing LVQA and long-form AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Recent methods predominantly adapt Video LLMs to generate event boundary timestamps to handle temporal localization tasks, which struggle to leverage LLMs' powerful semantic understanding. In this work, we introduce MeCo, a novel timestamp-free framework that enables video LLMs to fully harness their intrinsic semantic capabilities for temporal localization tasks. Rather than outputting boundary timestamps, MeCo partitions videos into holistic event and transition segments based on the proposed structural token generation and grounding pipeline, derived from video LLMs' temporal structure understanding capability. We further propose a query-focused captioning task that compels the LLM to extract fine-grained, event-specific details, bridging the gap between localization and higher-level semantics and enhancing localization performance. Extensive experiments on diverse temporal localization tasks show that MeCo consistently outperforms boundary-centric methods, underscoring the benefits of a semantic-driven approach for temporal localization with video LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Although several methods have been proposed to address different morphologies, it remains a challenge for learning-based policies to manage various combinations of proprioceptive information. This paper presents Masked Sensory-Temporal Attention (MSTA), a novel transformer-based mechanism with masking for quadruped locomotion. It employs direct sensor-level attention to enhance the sensory-temporal understanding and handle different combinations of sensor data, serving as a foundation for incorporating unseen information. MSTA can effectively understand its states even with a large portion of missing information, and is flexible enough to be deployed on physical systems despite the long input sequence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for ICRA 2025.

While Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on neuromorphic hardware are often considered for energy-efficient and low latency event-based data processing, they often fall short of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in accuracy and flexibility. Here, we introduce Attention-based Hybrid SNN-ANN backbones for event-based object detection to leverage the strengths of both SNN and ANN architectures. A novel Attention-based SNN-ANN bridge module captures sparse spatial and temporal relations from the SNN layer and converts them into dense feature maps for the ANN part of the backbone. Additionally, we present a variant that integrates DWConvL-STMs to the ANN blocks to capture slower dynamics. This multi-timescale network combines fast SNN processing for short timesteps with long-term dense RNN processing, effectively capturing both fast and slow dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses SNN-based approaches by significant margins, with results comparable to existing ANN and RNN-based methods. Unlike ANN-only networks, the hybrid setup allows us to implement the SNN blocks on digital neuromorphic hardware to investigate the feasibility of our approach. Extensive ablation studies and implementation on neuromorphic hardware confirm the effectiveness of our proposed modules and architectural choices. Our hybrid SNN-ANN architectures pave the way for ANN-like performance at a drastically reduced parameter, latency, and power budget.</p></details> |  |

However, training dense voxel decoders to capture fine-grained geometry and semantics can demand hundreds of GPU hours, and such models often fail to adapt to varying voxel resolutions or new classes without extensive retraining. To overcome these limitations, we propose a practical and flexible test-time occupancy prediction framework termed TT-GaussOcc. Our approach incrementally optimizes time-aware 3D Gaussians instantiated from raw sensor streams at runtime, enabling voxelization at arbitrary user-specified resolution. Specifically, TT-GaussOcc operates in a "lift-move-voxel" symphony: we first "lift" surrounding-view semantics obtained from 2D vision foundation models (VLMs) to instantiate Gaussians at non-empty 3D space; Next, we "move" dynamic Gaussians from previous frames along estimated Gaussian scene flow to complete appearance and eliminate trailing artifacts of fast-moving objects, while accumulating static Gaussians to enforce temporal consistency; Finally, we mitigate inherent noises in semantic predictions and scene flow vectors by periodically smoothing neighboring Gaussians during optimization, using proposed trilateral RBF kernels that jointly consider color, semantic, and spatial affinities. The historical static and current dynamic Gaussians are then combined and voxelized to generate occupancy prediction. Extensive experiments on Occ3D and nuCraft with varying voxel resolutions demonstrate that TT-GaussOcc surpasses self-supervised baselines by 46% on mIoU without any offline training, and supports finer voxel resolutions at 2.6 FPS inference speed.</p></details> |  |

Recent approaches mainly focus on employing image-level features to construct temporal dependencies and generate prototypes for each action category. However, a considerable number of these methods utilize mainly image-level features that incorporate background noise and focus insufficiently on real foreground (action-related instances), thereby compromising the recognition capability, particularly in the few-shot scenario. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel joint Image-Instance level Spatial-temporal attention approach (I2ST) for Few-shot Action Recognition. The core concept of I2ST is to perceive the action-related instances and integrate them with image features via spatial-temporal attention. Specifically, I2ST consists of two key components: Action-related Instance Perception and Joint Image-Instance Spatial-temporal Attention. Given the basic representations from the feature extractor, the Action-related Instance Perception is introduced to perceive action-related instances under the guidance of a text-guided segmentation model. Subsequently, the Joint Image-Instance Spatial-temporal Attention is used to construct the feature dependency between instances and images...</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Computer Vision and Image Understanding</p></details> |

Study Design: Observational study using longitudinal healthcare data. Methods: Analysis of 18144 adults with ID (10168 males and 7976 females) identified in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, linked to Hospital Episode Statistics Admitted Patient Care and Outpatient data (2000-2021). We used temporal analysis to establish directional associations among 40 long-term conditions, stratified by sex and age groups (under 45, 45-64, 65 and over). Results: The high prevalence of enduring mental illness across all age groups is an important finding unique to this population. In males, mental illness occurred along with upper gastrointestinal conditions (specifically reflux disorders), while in females, mental illness presented alongside reflux disorders, chronic pain, and endocrine conditions such as thyroid problems. Among young males with intellectual disability, the combination of cerebral palsy with dysphagia, epilepsy, chronic constipation, and chronic pneumonia represents a distinctive pattern. In those aged 45-64, we observed early onset of lifestyle conditions like diabetes and hypertension, though notably these conditions co-occurred with mental illness and anaemia at rates exceeding those in the general population. The health conditions in those aged 65 and over largely mirrored those seen in the general aging population. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the complex patterns of MLTCs in this population, revealing sex-specific associations across age groups, and identified temporal associations, thus providing insights into disease progression, which can inform targeted prevention strategies and interventions to prevent premature mortality.</p></details> |  |

Despite notable progress in single-image virtual try-on (VTO), current methodologies often struggle to preserve a consistent and authentic appearance of clothing across extended video sequences. This challenge arises from the complexities of capturing dynamic human pose and maintaining target clothing characteristics. We leverage pre-existing video foundation models to introduce RealVVT, a photoRealistic Video Virtual Try-on framework tailored to bolster stability and realism within dynamic video contexts. Our methodology encompasses a Clothing & Temporal Consistency strategy, an Agnostic-guided Attention Focus Loss mechanism to ensure spatial consistency, and a Pose-guided Long Video VTO technique adept at handling extended video sequences.Extensive experiments across various datasets confirms that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in both single-image and video VTO tasks, offering a viable solution for practical applications within the realms of fashion e-commerce and virtual fitting environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (8 pages main text, 2 pages references), 5 figures in the main text, and 4 pages supplementary materials with 3 additional figures</p></details> |

Although GNNs have shown great promise in handling traffic datasets, their deployment in real-life applications has been hindered by scalability constraints arising from high-order message passing. Additionally, the over-smoothing problem of GNNs may lead to indistinguishable region representations as the number of layers increases, resulting in performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose a new knowledge distillation paradigm termed LightST that transfers spatial and temporal knowledge from a high-capacity teacher to a lightweight student. Specifically, we introduce a spatio-temporal knowledge distillation framework that helps student MLPs capture graph-structured global spatio-temporal patterns while alleviating the over-smoothing effect with adaptive knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments verify that LightST significantly speeds up traffic flow predictions by 5X to 40X compared to state-of-the-art spatio-temporal GNNs, all while maintaining superior accuracy.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Due to the inherent uncertainty in vessel behavior, trajectory prediction systems must adopt a multimodal approach to accurately model potential future motion states. However, existing vessel trajectory prediction methods lack the ability to comprehensively model behavioral multi-modality. To better capture multimodal behavior in interactive scenarios, we propose modeling interactions as dynamic graphs, replacing traditional aggregation-based techniques that rely on vessel states. By leveraging the natural multimodal capabilities of diffusion models, we frame the trajectory prediction task as an inverse process of motion uncertainty diffusion, wherein uncertainties across potential navigational areas are progressively eliminated until the desired trajectories is produced. In summary, we pioneer the integration of Spatio-Temporal Graph (STG) with diffusion models in ship trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments on real Automatic Identification System (AIS) data validate the superiority of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been ACCEPTED as a FULL PAPER at DASFAA 2025</p></details> |

These interactions can be effectively represented as time-evolving graphs, where predicting future connections is a key task in applications such as recommendation systems. Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have achieved strong results for such predictive tasks but typically require extensive training data, which is often limited in real-world scenarios. One approach to mitigating data scarcity is leveraging pre-trained models from related datasets. However, direct knowledge transfer between TGNNs is challenging due to their reliance on node-specific memory structures, making them inherently difficult to adapt across datasets. To address this, we introduce a novel transfer approach that disentangles node representations from their associated features through a structured bipartite encoding mechanism. This decoupling enables more effective transfer of memory components and other learned inductive patterns from one dataset to another. Empirical evaluations on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly enhances TGNN performance in low-data regimes, outperforming non-transfer baselines by up to 56\% and surpassing existing transfer strategies by 36\%</p></details> |  |

Unlike previous approaches that process flattened local visual patches via direct discretization or adaptive query tokenization, SweetTok proposes a decoupling framework, compressing visual inputs through distinct spatial and temporal queries via \textbf{D}ecoupled \textbf{Q}uery \textbf{A}uto\textbf{E}ncoder (DQAE). This design allows SweetTok to efficiently compress video token count while achieving superior fidelity by capturing essential information across spatial and temporal dimensions. Furthermore, we design a \textbf{M}otion-enhanced \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{C}odebook (MLC) tailored for spatial and temporal compression to address the differences in semantic representation between appearance and motion information. SweetTok significantly improves video reconstruction results by \textbf{42.8\%} w.r.t rFVD on UCF-101 dataset. With a better token compression strategy, it also boosts downstream video generation results by \textbf{15.1\%} w.r.t gFVD. Additionally, the compressed decoupled tokens are imbued with semantic information, enabling few-shot recognition capabilities powered by LLMs in downstream applications.</p></details> |  |

As systems like autonomous driving become increasingly popular, ensuring their safety has become more important than ever. Therefore, this paper focuses on how to quickly and effectively detect various anomalies in the aforementioned systems, with the goal of making them safer and more effective. Many detection systems have been developed with great success under spatial contexts; however, there is still significant room for improvement when it comes to temporal context. While there is substantial work regarding this task, there is minimal work done regarding the efficiency of models and their ability to be applied to scenarios that require real-time inference, i.e., autonomous driving where anomalies need to be detected the moment they are within view. To address this gap, we propose STEAD (Spatio-Temporal Efficient Anomaly Detection), whose backbone is developed using (2+1)D Convolutions and Performer Linear Attention, which ensures computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. When tested on the UCF-Crime benchmark, our base model achieves an AUC of 91.34%, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art, and our fast version achieves an AUC of 88.87%, while having 99.70% less parameters and outperforming the previous state-of-the-art as well.

Our main contribution is LTLCodeGen, a method to translate natural language to syntactically correct LTL using code generation. We demonstrate the complete task planning method in real-world experiments involving human speech to provide navigation instructions to a mobile robot. We also thoroughly evaluate our approach in simulated and real-world experiments in comparison to end-to-end LLM task planning and state-of-the-art LLM-to-LTL translation methods.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often struggle to capture such fine-grained correlations and achieve real-time predictions. To address this, we propose a new 4D occupancy world model for autonomous driving, termed T$^3$Former. T$^3$Former begins by pre-training a compact triplane representation that efficiently compresses the 3D semantically occupied environment. Next, T$^3$Former extracts multi-scale temporal motion features from the historical triplane and employs an autoregressive approach to iteratively predict the next triplane changes. Finally, T$^3$Former combines the triplane changes with the previous ones to decode them into future occupancy results and ego-motion trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of T$^3$Former, achieving 1.44$\times$ faster inference speed (26 FPS), while improving the mean IoU to 36.09 and reducing the mean absolute planning error to 1.0 meters.</p></details> |  |

Deep Learning (DL), particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), have revolutionized this field by enhancing the accuracy of classification tasks. In this work, a novel approach combining a transformer-based Swin-Unet architecture with seasonal synthesized spatio-temporal images has been employed to classify LC types using spatio-temporal features extracted from Sentinel-1 (S1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, organized into seasonal clusters. The study focuses on three distinct regions - Amazonia, Africa, and Siberia - and evaluates the model performance across diverse ecoregions within these areas. By utilizing seasonal feature sequences instead of dense temporal sequences, notable performance improvements have been achieved, especially in regions with temporal data gaps like Siberia, where S1 data distribution is uneven and non-uniform.

Previous supervised approaches rely heavily on costly manual annotations, while LiDAR sequences naturally capture temporal motion cues that can be leveraged for self-supervised learning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{T}emporal \textbf{O}verlapping \textbf{P}rediction (\textbf{TOP}), a self-supervised pre-training method that alleviate the labeling burden for MOS. \textbf{TOP} explores the temporal overlapping points that commonly observed by current and adjacent scans, and learns spatiotemporal representations by predicting the occupancy states of temporal overlapping points. Moreover, we utilize current occupancy reconstruction as an auxiliary pre-training objective, which enhances the current structural awareness of the model. We conduct extensive experiments and observe that the conventional metric Intersection-over-Union (IoU) shows strong bias to objects with more scanned points, which might neglect small or distant objects. To compensate for this bias, we introduce an additional metric called $\text{mIoU}_{\text{obj}}$ to evaluate object-level performance. Experiments on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI show that \textbf{TOP} outperforms both supervised training-from-scratch baseline and other self-supervised pre-training baselines by up to 28.77\% relative improvement, demonstrating strong transferability across LiDAR setups and generalization to other tasks. Code and pre-trained models will be publicly available upon publication.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce TIDE (Temporal-aware Sparse Autoencoders for Interpretable Diffusion transformErs), a novel framework that enhances temporal reconstruction within DiT activation layers across denoising steps. TIDE employs Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) with a sparse bottleneck layer to extract interpretable and hierarchical features, revealing that diffusion models inherently learn hierarchical features at multiple levels (e.g., 3D, semantic, class) during generative pre-training. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance, with a mean squared error (MSE) of 1e-3 and a cosine similarity of 0.97, demonstrating superior accuracy in capturing activation dynamics along the denoising trajectory. Beyond interpretability, we showcase TIDE's potential in downstream applications such as sparse activation-guided image editing and style transfer, enabling improved controllability for generative systems. By providing a comprehensive training and evaluation protocol tailored for DiTs, TIDE contributes to developing more interpretable, transparent, and trustworthy generative models.</p></details> |  |

We report on a soma design workshop that explored how our bodies could collide with telepresence robots, mobility aids, and a quadruped robot. Based on our findings, we employed soma trajectories to analyse collisions as extended experiences that negotiate key transitions of consent, preparation, launch, contact, ripple, sting, untangle, debris and reflect. We then employed these ideas to analyse two collision experiences, an accidental collision between a person and a drone, and the deliberate design of a robot to play with cats, revealing how real-world collisions involve the complex and ongoing entanglement of soma trajectories. We discuss how viewing collisions as entangled trajectories, or tangles, can be used analytically, as a design approach, and as a lens to broach ethical complexity.</p></details> | 32 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Sparse canonical correlation analysis for multiple measurements with latent trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15140v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Canonical Correlation Analysis, CCA, is a widely used multivariate method in omics research for integrating high dimensional datasets. CCA identifies hidden links by deriving linear projections of features maximally correlating datasets. For standard CCA, observations must be independent of each other. As a result, it cannot properly deal with repeated measurements. Current CCA extensions dealing with these challenges either perform CCA on summarized data or estimate correlations for each measurement. While these techniques factor in the correlation between measurements, they are sub-optimal for high dimensional analysis and exploiting this datas longitudinal qualities. We propose a novel extension of sparse CCA that incorporates time dynamics at the latent level through longitudinal models. This approach addresses the correlation of repeated measurements while drawing latent paths, focusing on dynamics in the correlation structures. To aid interpretability and computational efficiency, we implement a penalty to enforce fixed sparsity levels. We estimate these trajectories fitting longitudinal models to the low dimensional latent variables, leveraging the clustered structure of high dimensional datasets, thus exploring shared longitudinal latent mechanisms. Furthermore, modeling time in the latent space significantly reduces computational burden. We validate our models performance using simulated data and show its real world applicability with data from the Human Microbiome Project. Our CCA method for repeated measurements enables efficient estimation of canonical correlations across measurements for clustered data. Compared to existing methods, ours substantially reduces computational time in high dimensional analyses as well as provides longitudinal trajectories that yield interpretable and insightful results.</p></details> | 19 pages, 13 figures |

However, existing TUL methods are limited by high model complexity and poor learning of the effective representations of trajectories, rendering them ineffective in handling large-scale user trajectory data. In this work, we propose a novel $\underline{Scal}$abl$\underline{e}$ Trajectory-User Linking with dual-stream representation networks for large-scale $\underline{TUL}$ problem, named ScaleTUL. Specifically, ScaleTUL generates two views using temporal and spatial augmentations to exploit supervised contrastive learning framework to effectively capture the irregularities of trajectories. In each view, a dual-stream trajectory encoder, consisting of a long-term encoder and a short-term encoder, is designed to learn unified trajectory representations that fuse different temporal-spatial dependencies. Then, a TUL layer is used to associate the trajectories with the corresponding users in the representation space using a two-stage training model. Experimental results on check-in mobility datasets from three real-world cities and the nationwide U.S. demonstrate the superiority of ScaleTUL over state-of-the-art baselines for large-scale TUL tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Unlike conventional approaches that rely on predefined desired trajectories, the proposed framework optimizes the collaborative motion dynamically using the inverse differential Riccati equation, ensuring adaptability to task variations and human input. The generated trajectory serves as the reference for a neuro-adaptive PID controller, which leverages a neural network to adjust control gains in real time, addressing system uncertainties while maintaining low computational complexity.

Recent advances in constrained trajectory prediction focus on structured constraints by constructing optimization objectives. However, handling unstructured constraints is challenging due to the lack of differentiable formal definitions. To address this, we propose a novel method for constrained trajectory prediction using a conditional generative paradigm, named Controllable Trajectory Diffusion (CTD). The key idea is that any trajectory corresponds to a degree of conformity to a constraint. By quantifying this degree and treating it as a condition, a model can implicitly learn to predict trajectories under unstructured constraints. CTD employs a pre-trained scoring model to predict the degree of conformity (i.e., a score), and uses this score as a condition for a conditional diffusion model to generate trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that CTD achieves high accuracy on the ETH/UCY and SDD benchmarks. Qualitative analysis confirms that CTD ensures adherence to unstructured constraints and can predict trajectories that satisfy combinatorial constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>has b...</summary><p>has been accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |

| **[TraSCE: Trajectory Steering for Concept Erasure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07658v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have brought them to the public spotlight, becoming widely accessible and embraced by everyday users. However, these models have been shown to generate harmful content such as not-safe-for-work (NSFW) images. While approaches have been proposed to erase such abstract concepts from the models, jail-breaking techniques have succeeded in bypassing such safety measures. In this paper, we propose TraSCE, an approach to guide the diffusion trajectory away from generating harmful content. Our approach is based on negative prompting, but as we show in this paper, a widely used negative prompting strategy is not a complete solution and can easily be bypassed in some corner cases. To address this issue, we first propose using a specific formulation of negative prompting instead of the widely used one. Furthermore, we introduce a localized loss-based guidance that enhances the modified negative prompting technique by steering the diffusion trajectory. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks in removing harmful content, including ones proposed by red teams, and erasing artistic styles and objects. Our proposed approach does not require any training, weight modifications, or training data (either image or prompt), making it easier for model owners to erase new concepts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization for Spatial Microstructure Control in Electron Beam Metal Additive Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18207v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metal additive manufacturing (AM) opens the possibility for spatial control of as-fabricated microstructure and properties. However, since the solid state diffusional transformations that drive microstructure outcomes are governed by nonlinear ODEs in terms of temperature, which is itself governed by PDEs over the entire part domain, solving for the system inputs needed to achieve desired microstructure distributions has proven difficult. In this work, we present a trajectory optimization approach for spatial control of microstructure in metal AM, which we demonstrate by controlling the hardness of a low-alloy steel in electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF). To this end, we present models for thermal and microstructural dynamics. Next, we use experimental data to identify the parameters of the microstructure transformation dynamics. We then pose spatial microstructure control as a finite-horizon optimal control problem. The optimal power field trajectory is computed using an augmented Lagrangian differential dynamic programming (AL-DDP) method with GPU acceleration. The resulting time-varying power fields are then realized on an EB-PBF machine through an approximation scheme. Measurements of the resultant hardness shows that the optimized power field trajectory is able to closely produce the desired hardness distribution.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |
| **[A representational framework for learning and encoding structurally enriched trajectories in complex agent environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13194v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability of artificial intelligence agents to make optimal decisions and generalise them to different domains and tasks is compromised in complex scenarios. One way to address this issue has focused on learning efficient representations of the world and on how the actions of agents affect them, such as disentangled representations that exploit symmetries. Whereas such representations are procedurally efficient, they are based on the compression of low-level state-action transitions, which lack structural richness. To address this problem, we propose to enrich the agent's ontology and extend the traditional conceptualisation of trajectories to provide a more nuanced view of task execution. Structurally Enriched Trajectories (SETs) extend the encoding of sequences of states and their transitions by incorporating hierarchical relations between objects, interactions and affordances. SETs are built as multi-level graphs, providing a detailed representation of the agent dynamics and a transferable functional abstraction of the task. SETs are integrated into an architecture, Structurally Enriched Trajectory Learning and Encoding (SETLE), that employs a heterogeneous graph-based memory structure of multi-level relational dependencies essential for generalisation. Using reinforcement learning as a data generation tool, we demonstrate that SETLE can support downstream tasks, enabling agents to recognise task-relevant structural patterns across diverse environments.</p></details> |  |

Our approach integrates several novel contributions, including a tailored object detector optimized for high-altitude bird's-eye view perspectives, a unique track stabilization method that uses detected vehicle bounding boxes as exclusion masks during image registration, and an orthophoto and master frame-based georeferencing strategy that enhances consistent alignment across multiple drone viewpoints. Additionally, our framework features robust vehicle dimension estimation and detailed road segmentation, enabling comprehensive traffic analysis. Conducted in the Songdo International Business District, South Korea, the study utilized a multi-drone experiment covering 20 intersections, capturing approximately 12TB of 4K video data over four days. The framework produced two high-quality datasets: the Songdo Traffic dataset, comprising approximately 700,000 unique vehicle trajectories, and the Songdo Vision dataset, containing over 5,000 human-annotated images with about 300,000 vehicle instances in four classes. Comparisons with high-precision sensor data from an instrumented probe vehicle highlight the accuracy and consistency of our extraction pipeline in dense urban environments. The public release of Songdo Traffic and Songdo Vision, and the complete source code for the extraction pipeline, establishes new benchmarks in data quality, reproducibility, and scalability in traffic research. Results demonstrate the potential of integrating drone technology with advanced computer vision for precise and cost-effective urban traffic monitoring, providing valuable resources for developing intelligent transportation systems and enhancing traffic management strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Other Vehicle Trajectories Are Also Needed: A Driving World Model Unifies Ego-Other Vehicle Trajectories in Video Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09215v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced end-to-end autonomous driving systems predict other vehicles' motions and plan ego vehicle's trajectory. The world model that can foresee the outcome of the trajectory has been used to evaluate the end-to-end autonomous driving system. However, existing world models predominantly emphasize the trajectory of the ego vehicle and leave other vehicles uncontrollable. This limitation hinders their ability to realistically simulate the interaction between the ego vehicle and the driving scenario. In addition, it remains a challenge to match multiple trajectories with each vehicle in the video to control the video generation. To address above issues, a driving World Model named EOT-WM is proposed in this paper, unifying Ego-Other vehicle Trajectories in videos. Specifically, we first project ego and other vehicle trajectories in the BEV space into the image coordinate to match each trajectory with its corresponding vehicle in the video. Then, trajectory videos are encoded by the Spatial-Temporal Variational Auto Encoder to align with driving video latents spatially and temporally in the unified visual space. A trajectory-injected diffusion Transformer is further designed to denoise the noisy video latents for video generation with the guidance of ego-other vehicle trajectories. In addition, we propose a metric based on control latent similarity to evaluate the controllability of trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted on the nuScenes dataset, and the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 30% in FID and 55% in FVD. The model can also predict unseen driving scenes with self-produced trajectories.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

The key challenge arises from depth variation induced spatio-temporal motion inconsistencies, disrupting the assumptions of local spatial or temporal motion smoothness in previous motion estimation frameworks. In contrast, event cameras offer new possibilities for 3D motion estimation through continuous adaptive pixel-level responses to scene changes. This paper presents EMoTive, a novel event-based framework that models spatio-temporal trajectories via event-guided non-uniform parametric curves, effectively characterizing locally heterogeneous spatio-temporal motion. Specifically, we first introduce Event Kymograph - an event projection method that leverages a continuous temporal projection kernel and decouples spatial observations to encode fine-grained temporal evolution explicitly. For motion representation, we introduce a density-aware adaptation mechanism to fuse spatial and temporal features under event guidance, coupled with a non-uniform rational curve parameterization framework to adaptively model heterogeneous trajectories. The final 3D motion estimation is achieved through multi-temporal sampling of parametric trajectories, yielding optical flow and depth motion fields. To facilitate evaluation, we introduce CarlaEvent3D, a multi-dynamic synthetic dataset for comprehensive validation. Extensive experiments on both this dataset and a real-world benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

The conventional approach is to enforce the dynamic model as a constraint. However, we show this approach leads to significantly redundant operations, as well as being heavily dependent on the state space representation. Specifically, we propose an intrinsic successive convexification methodology for optimal control on smooth manifolds. This so-called iSCvx is then applied to a representative example involving attitude trajectory optimization for a spacecraft subject to non-convex constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[CDKFormer: Contextual Deviation Knowledge-Based Transformer for Long-Tail Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12695v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the future movements of surrounding vehicles is essential for ensuring the safe operation and efficient navigation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in urban traffic environments. Existing vehicle trajectory prediction methods primarily focus on improving overall performance, yet they struggle to address long-tail scenarios effectively. This limitation often leads to poor predictions in rare cases, significantly increasing the risk of safety incidents. Taking Argoverse 2 motion forecasting dataset as an example, we first investigate the long-tail characteristics in trajectory samples from two perspectives, individual motion and group interaction, and deriving deviation features to distinguish abnormal from regular scenarios. On this basis, we propose CDKFormer, a Contextual Deviation Knowledge-based Transformer model for long-tail trajectory prediction. CDKFormer integrates an attention-based scene context fusion module to encode spatiotemporal interaction and road topology. An additional deviation feature fusion module is proposed to capture the dynamic deviations in the target vehicle status. We further introduce a dual query-based decoder, supported by a multi-stream decoder block, to sequentially decode heterogeneous scene deviation features and generate multimodal trajectory predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDKFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly enhancing prediction accuracy and robustness for long-tailed trajectories compared to existing methods, thus advancing the reliability of AVs in complex real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Power Swing Trajectory Influenced by Virtual Impedance-Based Current-Limiting Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12278v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grid-forming (GFM) inverter-based resources (IBRs) can emulate the external characteristics of synchronous generators (SGs) through appropriate control loop design. However, in systems with GFM IBRs, the apparent impedance trajectory under current limitation differs significantly from that of SG-based systems due to the limited overcurrent capability of power electronic devices. This difference challenges the power swing detection functions of distance relays designed for SG-based systems. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the apparent impedance trajectory over a full power swing cycle under two typical current-limiting strategies: variable virtual impedance (VI) and adaptive VI. The analysis reveals that the trajectory under VI current-limiting strategies differs significantly from that of a conventional SG. The results also indicate that the control parameters affect the characteristics of the trajectory. In addition, the new trajectories challenge conventional power swing detection functions, increasing the risk of malfunction. Furthermore, the implementation of VI leads to a deterioration in system stability. The theoretical analysis is further validated through simulations on the MATLAB/Simulink platform.</p></details> |  |
| **[D4orm: Multi-Robot Trajectories with Dynamics-aware Diffusion Denoised Deformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12204v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents an optimization method for generating kinodynamically feasible and collision-free multi-robot trajectories that exploits an incremental denoising scheme in diffusion models. Our key insight is that high-quality trajectories can be discovered merely by denoising noisy trajectories sampled from a distribution. This approach has no learning component, relying instead on only two ingredients: a dynamical model of the robots to obtain feasible trajectories via rollout, and a score function to guide denoising with Monte Carlo gradient approximation. The proposed framework iteratively optimizes the deformation from the previous round with this denoising process, allows \textit{anytime} refinement as time permits, supports different dynamics, and benefits from GPU acceleration. Our evaluations for differential-drive and holonomic teams with up to 16 robots in 2D and 3D worlds show its ability to discover high-quality solutions faster than other black-box optimization methods such as MPPI, approximately three times faster in a 3D holonomic case with 16 robots. As evidence for feasibility, we demonstrate zero-shot deployment of the planned trajectories on eight multirotors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Dataset Distillation by Matching Adversarial Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12069v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset distillation synthesizes compact datasets that enable models to achieve performance comparable to training on the original large-scale datasets. However, existing distillation methods overlook the robustness of the model, resulting in models that are vulnerable to adversarial attacks when trained on distilled data. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of ``robust dataset distillation", a novel paradigm that embeds adversarial robustness into the synthetic datasets during the distillation process. We propose Matching Adversarial Trajectories (MAT), a method that integrates adversarial training into trajectory-based dataset distillation. MAT incorporates adversarial samples during trajectory generation to obtain robust training trajectories, which are then used to guide the distillation process. As experimentally demonstrated, even through natural training on our distilled dataset, models can achieve enhanced adversarial robustness while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to existing distillation methods. Our work highlights robust dataset distillation as a new and important research direction and provides a strong baseline for future research to bridge the gap between efficient training and adversarial robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning a Fast Mixing Exogenous Block MDP using a Single Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03016v2)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In order to train agents that can quickly adapt to new objectives or reward functions, efficient unsupervised representation learning in sequential decision-making environments can be important. Frameworks such as the Exogenous Block Markov Decision Process (Ex-BMDP) have been proposed to formalize this representation-learning problem (Efroni et al., 2022b). In the Ex-BMDP framework, the agent's high-dimensional observations of the environment have two latent factors: a controllable factor, which evolves deterministically within a small state space according to the agent's actions, and an exogenous factor, which represents time-correlated noise, and can be highly complex. The goal of the representation learning problem is to learn an encoder that maps from observations into the controllable latent space, as well as the dynamics of this space. Efroni et al. (2022b) has shown that this is possible with a sample complexity that depends only on the size of the controllable latent space, and not on the size of the noise factor. However, this prior work has focused on the episodic setting, where the controllable latent state resets to a specific start state after a finite horizon. By contrast, if the agent can only interact with the environment in a single continuous trajectory, prior works have not established sample-complexity bounds. We propose STEEL, the first provably sample-efficient algorithm for learning the controllable dynamics of an Ex-BMDP from a single trajectory, in the function approximation setting. STEEL has a sample complexity that depends only on the sizes of the controllable latent space and the encoder function class, and (at worst linearly) on the mixing time of the exogenous noise factor. We prove that STEEL is correct and sample-efficient, and demonstrate STEEL on two toy problems. Code is available at: https://github.com/midi-lab/steel.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

While recent Imitation Learning (IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods have reduced the number of required demonstrations, they still rely on expert knowledge to collect high-quality data, limiting scalability and accessibility. We propose Sketch-to-Skill, a novel framework that leverages human-drawn 2D sketch trajectories to bootstrap and guide RL for robotic manipulation. Our approach extends beyond previous sketch-based methods, which were primarily focused on imitation learning or policy conditioning, limited to specific trained tasks. Sketch-to-Skill employs a Sketch-to-3D Trajectory Generator that translates 2D sketches into 3D trajectories, which are then used to autonomously collect initial demonstrations. We utilize these sketch-generated demonstrations in two ways: to pre-train an initial policy through behavior cloning and to refine this policy through RL with guided exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that Sketch-to-Skill achieves ~96% of the performance of the baseline model that leverages teleoperated demonstration data, while exceeding the performance of a pure reinforcement learning policy by ~170%, only from sketch inputs. This makes robotic manipulation learning more accessible and potentially broadens its applications across various domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Peiho...</summary><p>Peihong Yu and Amisha Bhaskar contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

However, this does not reflect the complexities of real-world tasks where curvatures can vary arbitrarily, limiting its applications. This study aims to address this gap by introducing the total curvature parameter K into the equation to account for the overall curviness characteristic of a path. To validate this extension, we conducted a mouse-steering experiment on fixed-width paths with varying lengths and curviness levels. Our results demonstrate that the introduction of K significantly improves model fitness for movement time prediction over traditional models. These findings advance our understanding of movement in complex environments and support potential applications in fields like speech motor control and virtual navigation.</p></details> |  |

However, optimization-based real-time motion planning becomes increasingly challenging due to the problem's probable non-convexity and the inherent limitations of Non-Linear Programming algorithms. Highly nonlinear dynamics, obstacle avoidance constraints, and non-convex inputs can exacerbate these difficulties. To address these hurdles, this paper proposes a two-layer optimization algorithm for 2D vehicles by dynamically reformulating small time horizon convex programming subproblems, aiming to provide real-time guarantees for trajectory optimization. Our approach involves breaking down the original problem into small horizon-based planning cycles with fixed final times, referred to as planning cycles. Each planning cycle is then solved within a series of restricted convex sets identified by our customized search algorithms incrementally. The key benefits of our proposed algorithm include fast computation speeds and lower task time. We demonstrate these advantages through mathematical proofs under some moderate preconditions and experimental results.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, the potential of transformer-based diffusion models for effectively generating videos with controllable motion remains an area of limited exploration. This paper introduces Tora, the first trajectory-oriented DiT framework that concurrently integrates textual, visual, and trajectory conditions, thereby enabling scalable video generation with effective motion guidance. Specifically, Tora consists of a Trajectory Extractor (TE), a Spatial-Temporal DiT, and a Motion-guidance Fuser (MGF). The TE encodes arbitrary trajectories into hierarchical spacetime motion patches with a 3D motion compression network. The MGF integrates the motion patches into the DiT blocks to generate consistent videos that accurately follow designated trajectories. Our design aligns seamlessly with DiT's scalability, allowing precise control of video content's dynamics with diverse durations, aspect ratios, and resolutions.

This paper introduces Trajectory Mamba, a novel efficient trajectory prediction framework based on the selective state-space model (SSM). Conventional attention-based models face the challenge of computational costs that grow quadratically with the number of targets, hindering their application in highly dynamic environments. In response, we leverage the SSM to redesign the self-attention mechanism in the encoder-decoder architecture, thereby achieving linear time complexity. To address the potential reduction in prediction accuracy resulting from modifications to the attention mechanism, we propose a joint polyline encoding strategy to better capture the associations between static and dynamic contexts, ultimately enhancing prediction accuracy. Additionally, to balance prediction accuracy and inference speed, we adopted the decoder that differs entirely from the encoder. Through cross-state space attention, all target agents share the scene context, allowing the SSM to interact with the shared scene representation during decoding, thus inferring different trajectories over the next prediction steps. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of inference speed and parameter efficiency on both the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets. It demonstrates a four-fold reduction in FLOPs compared to existing methods and reduces parameter count by over 40% while surpassing the performance of the vast majority of previous methods. These findings validate the effectiveness of Trajectory Mamba in trajectory prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

The ASV exhibits cyclic operation due to the nature of the solar profile, but weather patterns create inevitable disturbances in this profile. The nature of the problem results in a formulation where the satisfaction of pointwise-in-time state of charge constraints does not generally guarantee persistent feasibility, and the goal is to maximize information gathered over a very long (ultimately persistent) time duration. To address these challenges, we first use barrier functions to tighten pointwise-in-time state of charge constraints by the minimal amount necessary to achieve persistent feasibility. We then use indirect methods to derive a simple switching control law, where the optimal velocity is shown to be an undetermined constant value during each constraint-inactive time segment. To identify this optimal constant velocity (which can vary from one segment to the next), we employ an iterative learning approach. The result is a simple closed-form control law that does not require a solar forecast. We present simulation-based validation results, based on a model of the SeaTrac SP-48 ASV and solar data from the North Carolina coast. These simulation results show that the proposed methodology, which amounts to a closed-form controller and simple iterative learning update law, performs nearly as well as a model predictive control approach that requires an accurate future solar forecast and significantly greater computational capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimating relapse time distribution from longitudinal biomarker trajectories using iterative regression and continuous time Markov processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10448v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biomarker measurements obtained by blood sampling are often used as a non-invasive means of monitoring tumour progression in cancer patients. Diseases evolve dynamically over time, and studying longitudinal observations of specific biomarkers can help to understand patients response to treatment and predict disease progression. We propose a novel iterative regression-based method to estimate changes in patients status within a cohort that includes censored patients, and illustrate it on clinical data from myeloma cases. We formulate the relapse time estimation problem in the framework of Piecewise Deterministic Markov processes (PDMP), where the Euclidean component is a surrogate biomarker for patient state. This approach enables continuous-time estimation of the status-change dates, which in turn allows for accurate inference of the relapse time distribution. A key challenge lies in the partial observability of the process, a complexity that has been rarely addressed in previous studies. . We evaluate the performance of our procedure through a simulation study and compare it with different approaches. This work is a proof of concept on biomarker trajectories with simple behaviour, but our method can easily be extended to more complex dynamics.</p></details> |  |

While generative models have shown promise in synthesizing feasible trajectories, they often fail to capture the nuanced variability of human driving styles due to dataset biases and distributional shifts. To address this, we introduce TrajHF, a human feedback-driven finetuning framework for generative trajectory models, designed to align motion planning with diverse driving preferences. TrajHF incorporates multi-conditional denoiser and reinforcement learning with human feedback to refine multi-modal trajectory generation beyond conventional imitation learning. This enables better alignment with human driving preferences while maintaining safety and feasibility constraints. TrajHF achieves PDMS of 93.95 on NavSim benchmark, significantly exceeding other methods. TrajHF sets a new paradigm for personalized and adaptable trajectory generation in autonomous driving.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

| **[GoalFlow: Goal-Driven Flow Matching for Multimodal Trajectories Generation in End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05689v3)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose GoalFlow, an end-to-end autonomous driving method for generating high-quality multimodal trajectories. In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

Key operations such as conflict detection and resolution, aircraft anomaly monitoring, and the management of congested flight paths are increasingly reliant on this foundational technology, underscoring the urgent demand for intelligent solutions. The dynamics in airport terminal zones and crowded airspaces are intricate and ever-changing; however, current methodologies do not sufficiently account for the interactions among aircraft. To tackle these challenges, we propose DA-STGCN, an innovative spatiotemporal graph convolutional network that integrates a dual attention mechanism. Our model reconstructs the adjacency matrix through a self-attention approach, enhancing the capture of node correlations, and employs graph attention to distill spatiotemporal characteristics, thereby generating a probabilistic distribution of predicted trajectories. This novel adjacency matrix, reconstructed with the self-attention mechanism, is dynamically optimized throughout the network's training process, offering a more nuanced reflection of the inter-node relationships compared to traditional algorithms. The performance of the model is validated on two ADS-B datasets, one near the airport terminal area and the other in dense airspace. Experimental results demonstrate a notable improvement over current 4D trajectory prediction methods, achieving a 20% and 30% reduction in the Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), respectively. The incorporation of a Dual-Attention module has been shown to significantly enhance the extraction of node correlations, as verified by ablation experiments.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel motion prediction conditional flow matching model, termed MoFlow, to predict K-shot future trajectories for all agents in a given scene. We design a novel flow matching loss function that not only ensures at least one of the $K$ sets of future trajectories is accurate but also encourages all $K$ sets of future trajectories to be diverse and plausible. Furthermore, by leveraging the implicit maximum likelihood estimation (IMLE), we propose a novel distillation method for flow models that only requires samples from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the real-world datasets, including SportVU NBA games, ETH-UCY, and SDD, demonstrate that both our teacher flow model and the IMLE-distilled student model achieve state-of-the-art performance. These models can generate diverse trajectories that are physically and socially plausible. Moreover, our one-step student model is $\textbf{100}$ times faster than the teacher flow model during sampling.

To address this, we propose Loss Trajectory Correlation (LTC), a novel metric for coreset selection that identifies critical training samples driving generalization. $LTC$ quantifies the alignment between training sample loss trajectories and validation set loss trajectories, enabling the construction of compact, representative subsets. Unlike traditional methods with computational and storage overheads that are infeasible to scale to large datasets, $LTC$ achieves superior efficiency as it can be computed as a byproduct of training. Our results on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k show that $LTC$ consistently achieves accuracy on par with or surpassing state-of-the-art coreset selection methods, with any differences remaining under 1%. LTC also effectively transfers across various architectures, including ResNet, VGG, DenseNet, and Swin Transformer, with minimal performance degradation (<2%). Additionally, LTC offers insights into training dynamics, such as identifying aligned and conflicting sample behaviors, at a fraction of the computational cost of traditional methods. This framework paves the way for scalable coreset selection and efficient dataset optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Post-interactive Multimodal Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09366v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling the interactions among agents for trajectory prediction of autonomous driving has been challenging due to the inherent uncertainty in agents' behavior. The interactions involved in the predicted trajectories of agents, also called post-interactions, have rarely been considered in trajectory prediction models. To this end, we propose a coarse-to-fine Transformer for multimodal trajectory prediction, i.e., Pioformer, which explicitly extracts the post-interaction features to enhance the prediction accuracy. Specifically, we first build a Coarse Trajectory Network to generate coarse trajectories based on the observed trajectories and lane segments, in which the low-order interaction features are extracted with the graph neural networks. Next, we build a hypergraph neural network-based Trajectory Proposal Network to generate trajectory proposals, where the high-order interaction features are learned by the hypergraphs. Finally, the trajectory proposals are sent to the Proposal Refinement Network for further refinement. The observed trajectories and trajectory proposals are concatenated together as the inputs of the Proposal Refinement Network, in which the post-interaction features are learned by combining the previous interaction features and trajectory consistency features. Moreover, we propose a three-stage training scheme to facilitate the learning process. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse 1 dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method. Compared with the baseline HiVT-64, our model has reduced the prediction errors by 4.4%, 8.4%, 14.4%, 5.7% regarding metrics minADE6, minFDE6, MR6, and brier-minFDE6, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, existing fault-tolerant control methods exhibit significant oscillations during docking and separation, impacting system stability. To address this issue, we propose a novel fault-tolerant control reallocation method that adapts to arbitrary number of modular robots and their assembly formations. The algorithm redistributes the expected collective force and torque required for MARS to individual unit according to their moment arm relative to the center of MARS mass. Furthermore, We propose an agile trajectory planning method for MARS of arbitrary configurations, which is collision-avoiding and dynamically feasible. Our work represents the first comprehensive approach to enable fault-tolerant and collision avoidance flight for MARS. We validate our method through extensive simulations, demonstrating improved fault tolerance, enhanced trajectory tracking accuracy, and greater robustness in cluttered environments.

| **[Learning Few-Step Diffusion Models by Trajectory Distribution Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06674v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accelerating diffusion model sampling is crucial for efficient AIGC deployment. While diffusion distillation methods -- based on distribution matching and trajectory matching -- reduce sampling to as few as one step, they fall short on complex tasks like text-to-image generation. Few-step generation offers a better balance between speed and quality, but existing approaches face a persistent trade-off: distribution matching lacks flexibility for multi-step sampling, while trajectory matching often yields suboptimal image quality. To bridge this gap, we propose learning few-step diffusion models by Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM), a unified distillation paradigm that combines the strengths of distribution and trajectory matching. Our method introduces a data-free score distillation objective, aligning the student's trajectory with the teacher's at the distribution level. Further, we develop a sampling-steps-aware objective that decouples learning targets across different steps, enabling more adjustable sampling. This approach supports both deterministic sampling for superior image quality and flexible multi-step adaptation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with remarkable efficiency. Our model, TDM, outperforms existing methods on various backbones, such as SDXL and PixArt-$\alpha$, delivering superior quality and significantly reduced training costs. In particular, our method distills PixArt-$\alpha$ into a 4-step generator that outperforms its teacher on real user preference at 1024 resolution. This is accomplished with 500 iterations and 2 A800 hours -- a mere 0.01% of the teacher's training cost. In addition, our proposed TDM can be extended to accelerate text-to-video diffusion. Notably, TDM can outperform its teacher model (CogVideoX-2B) by using only 4 NFE on VBench, improving the total score from 80.91 to 81.65.

While prior work established the worst case optimality of standard flow matching under Wasserstein distances, the theoretical guarantees for higher-order flow matching - which incorporates acceleration terms to refine sample trajectories - remain unexplored. In this paper, we bridge this gap by proving that higher-order flow matching preserves worst case optimality as a distribution estimator. We derive upper bounds on the estimation error for second-order flow matching, demonstrating that the convergence rates depend polynomially on the smoothness of the target distribution (quantified via Besov spaces) and key parameters of the ODE dynamics. Our analysis employs neural network approximations with carefully controlled depth, width, and sparsity to bound acceleration errors across both small and large time intervals, ultimately unifying these results into a general worst case optimal bound for all time steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2410.11261</p></details> |

Both these tasks are crucial for automation and assistance in endoscopy surgery. Given the safety-critical nature of these tasks, reliable uncertainty quantification is essential. Conformal prediction is a fast-growing and widely recognized framework for uncertainty estimation in machine learning and computer vision, offering distribution-free, theoretically valid prediction intervals. In this work, we explore the application of standard conformal prediction and conformalized quantile regression to estimate uncertainty in forecasting surgical instrument motion, i.e., predicting direction and magnitude of surgical instruments' future motion. We analyze and compare their coverage and interval sizes, assessing the impact of multiple hypothesis testing and correction methods. Additionally, we show how these techniques can be employed to produce useful uncertainty heatmaps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study applying conformal prediction to surgical guidance, marking an initial step toward constructing principled prediction intervals with formal coverage guarantees in this domain.</p></details> |  |

This sampling method yields trajectory samples that are tightly clustered around a mean trajectory. This clustering behavior in turn, limits the exploration capability of the controller and reduces the likelihood of finding feasible solutions in complex environments. Recent work has attempted to address this problem by either reshaping the resulting trajectory distribution or increasing the sample entropy to enhance diversity and promote exploration. In our recent work, we introduced the concept of C-Uniform trajectory generation [1] which allows the computation of control input probabilities to generate trajectories that sample the configuration space uniformly. In this work, we first address the main limitation of this method: lack of scalability due to computational complexity. We introduce Neural C-Uniform, an unsupervised C-Uniform trajectory sampler that mitigates scalability issues by computing control input probabilities without relying on a discretized configuration space. Experiments show that Neural C-Uniform achieves a similar uniformity ratio to the original C-Uniform approach and generates trajectories over a longer time horizon while preserving uniformity. Next, we present CU-MPPI, which integrates Neural C-Uniform sampling into existing MPPI variants. We analyze the performance of CU-MPPI in simulation and real-world experiments. Our results indicate that in settings where the optimal solution has high curvature, CU-MPPI leads to drastic improvements in performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IROS2025</p></details> |

While learning-based prediction models have shown success in generating likely human trajectory predictions, integrating these stochastic models into a robot controller presents several challenges. The controller needs to account for interactive coupling between planned robot motion and human predictions while ensuring both predictions and robot actions are safe (i.e. collision-free). To address these challenges, we present a receding horizon crowd navigation method for single-robot multi-human environments. We first propose a diffusion model to generate joint trajectory predictions for all humans in the scene. We then incorporate these multi-modal predictions into a SICNav Bilevel MPC problem that simultaneously solves for a robot plan (upper-level) and acts as a safety filter to refine the predictions for non-collision (lower-level). Combining planning and prediction refinement into one bilevel problem ensures that the robot plan and human predictions are coupled. We validate the open-loop trajectory prediction performance of our diffusion model on the commonly used ETH/UCY benchmark and evaluate the closed-loop performance of our robot navigation method in simulation and extensive real-robot experiments demonstrating safe, efficient, and reactive robot motion.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid advancement in connected technologies, such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, valuable information from alternate views becomes accessible via wireless networks. The integration of information from alternative views has the potential to overcome the inherent limitations associated with a single viewpoint, such as occlusions and limited field of view. In this work, we introduce V2INet, a novel trajectory prediction framework designed to model multi-view data by extending existing single-view models. Unlike previous approaches where the multi-view data is manually fused or formulated as a separate training stage, our model supports end-to-end training, enhancing both flexibility and performance. Moreover, the predicted multimodal trajectories are calibrated by a post-hoc conformal prediction module to get valid and efficient confidence regions. We evaluated the entire framework using the real-world V2I dataset V2X-Seq. Our results demonstrate superior performance in terms of Final Displacement Error (FDE) and Miss Rate (MR) using a single GPU.

Current evaluation tasks like VQA and visual grounding remain too coarse to assess fine-grained pixel comprehension accurately. Though segmentation is foundational for pixel-level understanding, existing methods often require MLLMs to generate implicit tokens, decoded through external pixel decoders. This approach disrupts the MLLM's text output space, potentially compromising language capabilities and reducing flexibility and extensibility, while failing to reflect the model's intrinsic pixel-level understanding. Thus, we introduce the Human-Like Mask Annotation Task (HLMAT), a new paradigm where MLLMs mimic human annotators using interactive segmentation tools. Modeling segmentation as a multi-step Markov Decision Process, HLMAT enables MLLMs to iteratively generate text-based click points, achieving high-quality masks without architectural changes or implicit tokens. Through this setup, we develop SegAgent, a model fine-tuned on human-like annotation trajectories, which achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and supports additional tasks like mask refinement and annotation filtering. HLMAT provides a protocol for assessing fine-grained pixel understanding in MLLMs and introduces a vision-centric, multi-step decision-making task that facilitates exploration of MLLMs' visual reasoning abilities. Our adaptations of policy improvement method StaR and PRM-guided tree search further enhance model robustness in complex segmentation tasks, laying a foundation for future advancements in fine-grained visual perception and multi-step decision-making for MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR2...</summary><p>CVPR2025;Code will be released at \url{https://github.com/aim-uofa/SegAgent}</p></details> |

In order to handle these challenges, this work first proposes a novel concept, collaborative uncertainty (CU), which models the uncertainty resulting from interaction modules. Then we build a general CU-aware regression framework with an original permutation-equivariant uncertainty estimator to do both tasks of regression and uncertainty estimation. Further, we apply the proposed framework to current SOTA multi-agent multi-modal forecasting systems as a plugin module, which enables the SOTA systems to 1) estimate the uncertainty in the multi-agent multi-modal trajectory forecasting task; 2) rank the multiple predictions and select the optimal one based on the estimated uncertainty. We conduct extensive experiments on a synthetic dataset and two public large-scale multi-agent trajectory forecasting benchmarks. Experiments show that: 1) on the synthetic dataset, the CU-aware regression framework allows the model to appropriately approximate the ground-truth Laplace distribution; 2) on the multi-agent trajectory forecasting benchmarks, the CU-aware regression framework steadily helps SOTA systems improve their performances. Specially, the proposed framework helps VectorNet improve by 262 cm regarding the Final Displacement Error of the chosen optimal prediction on the nuScenes dataset; 3) for multi-agent multi-modal trajectory forecasting systems, prediction uncertainty is positively correlated with future stochasticity; and 4) the estimated CU values are highly related to the interactive information among agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2110.13947</p></details> |

In contrast, simple robotic grippers have low dexterity and fail to handle small objects effectively. This is why many automation tasks remain unsolved by robots. This paper presents an optimization-based framework for in-hand manipulation with a robotic hand equipped with compact Magnetic Tactile Sensors (MTSs). The small form factor of the robotic hand from Shadow Robot introduces challenges in estimating the state of the object while satisfying contact constraints. To address this, we formulate a trajectory optimization problem using Nonlinear Programming (NLP) for finger movements while ensuring contact points to change along the geometry of the fingers. Using the optimized trajectory from the solver, we implement and test an open-loop controller for rolling motion. To further enhance robustness and accuracy, we introduce a force controller for the fingers and a state estimator for the object utilizing MTSs. The proposed framework is validated through comparative experiments, showing that incorporating the force control with compliance consideration improves the accuracy and robustness of the rolling motion. Rolling an object with the force controller is 30\% more likely to succeed than running an open-loop controller.

Current OV-MOT methods typically rely primarily on instance-level detection and association, often overlooking trajectory information that is unique and essential for object tracking tasks. Utilizing trajectory information can enhance association stability and classification accuracy, especially in cases of occlusion and category ambiguity, thereby improving adaptability to novel classes. Thus motivated, in this paper we propose \textbf{TRACT}, an open-vocabulary tracker that leverages trajectory information to improve both object association and classification in OV-MOT. Specifically, we introduce a \textit{Trajectory Consistency Reinforcement} (\textbf{TCR}) strategy, that benefits tracking performance by improving target identity and category consistency. In addition, we present \textbf{TraCLIP}, a plug-and-play trajectory classification module. It integrates \textit{Trajectory Feature Aggregation} (\textbf{TFA}) and \textit{Trajectory Semantic Enrichment} (\textbf{TSE}) strategies to fully leverage trajectory information from visual and language perspectives for enhancing the classification results. Extensive experiments on OV-TAO show that our TRACT significantly improves tracking performance, highlighting trajectory information as a valuable asset for OV-MOT.

While motion capabilities and accurate localization for automated robots have rapidly developed, the challenge remains to generate efficient, smooth, comprehensive, and high-quality trajectories in these areas. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient planner for ground robots to autonomously navigate in large complex multi-layered architectural spaces. Considering that traversable regions typically include ground, slopes, and stairs, which are planar or nearly planar structures, we simplify the problem to navigation within and between complex intersecting planes. We first extract traversable planes from 3D point clouds through segmenting, merging, classifying, and connecting to build a plane-graph, which is lightweight but fully represents the traversable regions. We then build a trajectory optimization based on motion state trajectory and fully consider special constraints when crossing multi-layer planes to maximize the robot's maneuverability.

However, existing vessel trajectory prediction methods lack the ability to comprehensively model behavioral multi-modality. To better capture multimodal behavior in interactive scenarios, we propose modeling interactions as dynamic graphs, replacing traditional aggregation-based techniques that rely on vessel states. By leveraging the natural multimodal capabilities of diffusion models, we frame the trajectory prediction task as an inverse process of motion uncertainty diffusion, wherein uncertainties across potential navigational areas are progressively eliminated until the desired trajectories is produced. In summary, we pioneer the integration of Spatio-Temporal Graph (STG) with diffusion models in ship trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments on real Automatic Identification System (AIS) data validate the superiority of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been ACCEPTED as a FULL PAPER at DASFAA 2025</p></details> |

Accurate predictions enable the prevention of collisions, anticipation of crossing intent, and improved overall system efficiency. In this study, we present SGNetPose+, an enhancement of the SGNet architecture designed to integrate skeleton information or body segment angles with bounding boxes to predict pedestrian trajectories from video data to avoid hazards in autonomous driving. Skeleton information was extracted using a pose estimation model, and joint angles were computed based on the extracted joint data. We also apply temporal data augmentation by horizontally flipping video frames to increase the dataset size and improve performance. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the JAAD and PIE datasets using pose data with the bounding boxes, outperforming the SGNet model.

Trajectory inference deals with the challenge of reconstructing continuous processes from such observations. In this work, we propose methods for B-spline approximation and interpolation of point clouds through consecutive averaging that is intrinsic to the Wasserstein space. Combining subdivision schemes with optimal transport-based geodesic, our methods carry out trajectory inference at a chosen level of precision and smoothness, and can automatically handle scenarios where particles undergo division over time. We prove linear convergence rates and rigorously evaluate our method on cell data characterized by bifurcations, merges, and trajectory splitting scenarios like $supercells$, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art trajectory inference and interpolation methods. The results not only underscore the effectiveness of our method in inferring trajectories but also highlight the benefit of performing interpolation and approximation that respect the inherent geometric properties of the data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS 2025)</p></details> |

Ergodic trajectory optimization is an effective approach that generates coverage paths for problems related to robotic inspection, information gathering problems, and search and rescue. These optimization schemes compel the robot to spend time in a region proportional to the expected utility of visiting that region. Current methods for ergodic trajectory optimization rely on domain-specific knowledge, e.g., a defined utility map, and well-defined spatial basis functions to produce ergodic trajectories. Here, we present a generalization of ergodic trajectory optimization based on maximum mean discrepancy that requires only samples from the search domain. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to produce coverage trajectories on a variety of problem domains including robotic inspection of objects with differential kinematics constraints and on Lie groups without having access to domain specific knowledge. Furthermore, we show favorable computational scaling compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for ergodic trajectory optimization with a trade-off between domain specific knowledge and computational scaling, thus extending the versatility of ergodic coverage on a wider application domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages (excluding references), 1 table, 8 figures, submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Previous methods often struggle with content leakage and style misalignment, particularly when using image-driven approaches that aim to transfer precise styles. In this work, we introduce Trajectory Reset Attention Control (TRAC), a novel method that allows for high-quality style transfer while preserving content integrity. TRAC operates by resetting the denoising trajectory and enforcing attention control, thus enhancing content consistency while significantly reducing the computational costs against inversion-based methods. Additionally, a concept termed Style Medium is introduced to bridge the gap between content and style, enabling a more precise and harmonious transfer of stylistic elements. Building upon these concepts, we present a tuning-free framework that offers a stable, flexible, and efficient solution for both image and video style transfer. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework accommodates a wide range of stylized outputs, from precise content preservation to the production of visually striking results with vibrant and expressive styles.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose Goal-driven and User-Informed Dynamic Estimation for pedestrian trajectory using Chain-of-Thought (GUIDE-CoT). Our approach integrates two innovative modules: (1) a goal-oriented visual prompt, which enhances goal prediction accuracy combining visual prompts with a pretrained visual encoder, and (2) a chain-of-thought (CoT) LLM for trajectory generation, which generates realistic trajectories toward the predicted goal. Moreover, our method introduces controllable trajectory generation, allowing for flexible and user-guided modifications to the predicted paths. Through extensive experiments on the ETH/UCY benchmark datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering both high accuracy and greater adaptability in pedestrian trajectory prediction.

However, it remains a challenge to accurately account for agents' intentions and social behaviors when forecasting, and in particular, to simulate the unique randomness within each of those components in an explainable and decoupled way. Inspired by vibration systems and their resonance properties, we propose the Resonance (short for Re) model to encode and forecast pedestrian trajectories in the form of ``co-vibrations''. It decomposes trajectory modifications and randomnesses into multiple vibration portions to simulate agents' reactions to each single cause, and forecasts trajectories as the superposition of these independent vibrations separately. Also, benefiting from such vibrations and their spectral properties, representations of social interactions can be learned by emulating the resonance phenomena, further enhancing its explainability. Experiments on multiple datasets have verified its usefulness both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |

However, current research often overlooks the joint reasoning of scenario agents and lacks explainability in trajectory prediction models, limiting their practical use in real-world situations. To address this, we introduce the Explainable Conditional Diffusion-based Multimodal Trajectory Prediction (DMTP) model, which is designed to elucidate the environmental factors influencing predictions and reveal the underlying mechanisms. Our model integrates a modified conditional diffusion approach to capture multimodal trajectory patterns and employs a revised Shapley Value model to assess the significance of global and scenario-specific features. Experiments using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that our explainable model excels in identifying critical inputs and significantly outperforms baseline models in accuracy. Moreover, the factors identified align with the human driving experience, underscoring the model's effectiveness in learning accurate predictions.

Specifically, we use a GMM to model the multimodal behaviors of obstacles' uncertain states. Then, we develop a mixed-integer conic approximation to the chance-constrained trajectory planning problem with deterministic linear systems and polyhedral obstacles. When the GMM moments are estimated via finite samples, we develop a tight concentration bound to ensure the chance constraint with a desired confidence. Moreover, to limit the amount of constraint violation, we develop a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) approach corresponding to the chance constraints and derive a tractable approximation for known and estimated GMM moments. We verify our methods with state-of-the-art trajectory prediction algorithms and autonomous driving datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Control Systems Letters</p></details> |

We propose a novel framework, RealTraj, that enhances the real-world applicability of trajectory forecasting. Our approach includes two training phases -- self-supervised pretraining on synthetic data and weakly-supervised fine-tuning with limited real-world data -- to minimize data collection efforts. To improve robustness to real-world errors, we focus on both model design and training objectives. Specifically, we present Det2TrajFormer, a trajectory forecasting model that remains invariant to tracking noise by using past detections as inputs. Additionally, we pretrain the model using multiple pretext tasks, which enhance robustness and improve forecasting performance based solely on detection data. Unlike previous trajectory forecasting methods, our approach fine-tunes the model using only ground-truth detections, reducing the need for costly person ID annotations. In the experiments, we comprehensively verify the effectiveness of the proposed method against the limitations, and the method outperforms state-of-the-art trajectory forecasting methods on multiple datasets. The code will be released at https://fujiry0.github.io/RealTraj-project-page.</p></details> |  |

Most ZS-ICL methods use large language models (LLMs) to generate (input, label) pairs as pseudo-demonstrations and leverage historical pseudo-demonstrations to help solve the current problem. They assume that problems are from the same task and traverse them in a random order. However, in real-world scenarios, problems usually come from diverse tasks, and only a few belong to the same task. The random traversing order may generate unreliable pseudo-demonstrations and lead to error accumulation. To address this problem, we reformulate ZS-ICL as a planning problem and propose a Demonstration-aware Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) approach (DAWN-ICL), which leverages MCTS to strategically plan the problem-solving trajectories for ZS-ICL. In addition, to achieve effective and efficient Q value estimation, we propose a novel demonstration-aware Q-value function and use it to enhance the selection phase and accelerate the expansion and simulation phases in MCTS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DAWN-ICL on in-domain and cross-domain scenarios, and it even outperforms ICL using human-annotated labels.

This work proposes the Fast and Safe Data-Driven Planner to address this challenge. Sparse Gaussian predictions are introduced to improve both the computational efficiency and accuracy of opponent predictions. Furthermore, the proposed approach employs a bi-level quadratic programming framework to generate an overtaking trajectory leveraging the opponent predictions. The first level uses polynomial fitting to generate a rough trajectory, from which reference states and control inputs are derived for the second level. The second level formulates a model predictive control optimization problem in the Frenet frame, generating a trajectory that satisfies both kinematic feasibility and safety. Experimental results on the F1TENTH platform show that our method outperforms the State-of-the-Art, achieving an 8.93% higher overtaking success rate, allowing the maximum opponent speed, ensuring a smoother ego trajectory, and reducing 74.04% computational time compared to the Predictive Spliner method.

Map-matching aligns noisy, sparsely sampled GPS trajectories with digital road maps to reconstruct accurate vehicle paths. Traditional methods rely on geometric proximity, topology, and shortest-path heuristics, but they overlook two key factors: (1) drivers may prefer routes based on local road characteristics rather than shortest paths, revealing learnable shared preferences, and (2) GPS noise varies spatially due to multipath effects. These factors can reduce the effectiveness of conventional methods in complex scenarios and increase the effort required for heuristic-based implementations. This study introduces a data-driven, deep learning-based map-matching framework, formulating the task as machine translation, inspired by NLP. Specifically, a transformer-based encoder-decoder model learns contextual representations of noisy GPS points to infer trajectory behavior and road structures in an end-to-end manner. Trained on large-scale trajectory data, the method improves path estimation accuracy. Experiments on synthetic trajectories show that this approach outperforms conventional methods by integrating contextual awareness. Evaluation on real-world GPS traces from Manhattan, New York, achieves 75% accuracy in reconstructing navigated routes. These results highlight the effectiveness of transformers in capturing drivers' trajectory behaviors, spatial dependencies, and noise patterns, offering a scalable, robust solution for map-matching. This work contributes to advancing trajectory-driven foundation models for geospatial modeling and urban mobility applications.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

In this paper, inspired by topological planning, we propose a differentiable local homotopy invariant metric to model the interactions. By incorporating this topological metric as a constraint into multi-vehicle trajectory optimization, our framework is capable of generating multiple interactive trajectories from the same initial values, achieving controllable interactions as well as supporting user-designed interaction patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior optimality and efficiency over existing methods. We will release open-source code to advance relative research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Trajectory Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15429v3)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning safe behaviors without engaging in risky online interactions with the environment. Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |

While multi-modal trajectory prediction models generate multiple plausible future paths with associated probabilities, effectively quantifying uncertainty remains an open problem. In this work, we propose a novel multi-modal trajectory prediction approach based on evidential deep learning that estimates both positional and mode probability uncertainty in real time. Our approach leverages a Normal Inverse Gamma distribution for positional uncertainty and a Dirichlet distribution for mode uncertainty. Unlike sampling-based methods, it infers both types of uncertainty in a single forward pass, significantly improving efficiency. Additionally, we experimented with uncertainty-driven importance sampling to improve training efficiency by prioritizing underrepresented high-uncertainty samples over redundant ones. We perform extensive evaluations of our method on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets, demonstrating that it provides reliable uncertainty estimates while maintaining high trajectory prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |

We propose CompDiffuser, a novel generative approach that can solve new tasks by learning to compositionally stitch together shorter trajectory chunks from previously seen tasks. Our key insight is modeling the trajectory distribution by subdividing it into overlapping chunks and learning their conditional relationships through a single bidirectional diffusion model. This allows information to propagate between segments during generation, ensuring physically consistent connections. We conduct experiments on benchmark tasks of various difficulties, covering different environment sizes, agent state dimension, trajectory types, training data quality, and show that CompDiffuser significantly outperforms existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://comp-diffuser.github.io/</p></details> |

Such perturbations can lead to incorrect predictions of other agents' trajectories, potentially compromising the safety and efficiency of the ego-vehicle's decision-making process. Motivated by this challenge, we propose $\textit{Causal tRajecTory predICtion}$ $\textbf{(CRiTIC)}$, a novel model that utilizes a $\textit{Causal Discovery Network}$ to identify inter-agent causal relations over a window of past time steps. To incorporate discovered causal relationships, we propose a novel $\textit{Causal Attention Gating}$ mechanism to selectively filter information in the proposed Transformer-based architecture. We conduct extensive experiments on two autonomous driving benchmark datasets to evaluate the robustness of our model against non-causal perturbations and its generalization capacity. Our results indicate that the robustness of predictions can be improved by up to $\textbf{54%}$ without a significant detriment to prediction accuracy. Lastly, we demonstrate the superior domain generalizability of the proposed model, which achieves up to $\textbf{29%}$ improvement in cross-domain performance. These results underscore the potential of our model to enhance both robustness and generalization capacity for trajectory prediction in diverse autonomous driving domains.

| **[Quantifying and Modeling Driving Styles in Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04994v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory forecasting has become a popular deep learning task due to its relevance for scenario simulation for autonomous driving. Specifically, trajectory forecasting predicts the trajectory of a short-horizon future for specific human drivers in a particular traffic scenario. Robust and accurate future predictions can enable autonomous driving planners to optimize for low-risk and predictable outcomes for human drivers around them. Although some work has been done to model driving style in planning and personalized autonomous polices, a gap exists in explicitly modeling human driving styles for trajectory forecasting of human behavior. Human driving style is most certainly a correlating factor to decision making, especially in edge-case scenarios where risk is nontrivial, as justified by the large amount of traffic psychology literature on risky driving. So far, the current real-world datasets for trajectory forecasting lack insight on the variety of represented driving styles. While the datasets may represent real-world distributions of driving styles, we posit that fringe driving style types may also be correlated with edge-case safety scenarios. In this work, we conduct analyses on existing real-world trajectory datasets for driving and dissect these works from the lens of driving styles, which is often intangible and non-standardized.</p></details> |  |

Recent research highlights the importance of environmental contexts (e.g., maps) and the "multi-modality" of trajectories, leading to increasingly complex model structures. However, real-world deployments require lightweight models that can quickly migrate and adapt to new environments. Additionally, the core motivations of road agents, referred to as their intentions, deserves further exploration. In this study, we advocate that understanding and reasoning road agents' intention plays a key role in trajectory prediction tasks, and the main challenge is that the concept of intention is fuzzy and abstract. To this end, we present INTENT, an efficient intention-guided trajectory prediction model that relies solely on information contained in the road agent's trajectory. Our model distinguishes itself from existing models in several key aspects: (i) We explicitly model road agents' intentions through contrastive clustering, accommodating the fuzziness and abstraction of human intention in their trajectories. (ii) The proposed INTENT is based solely on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), resulting in reduced training and inference time, making it very efficient and more suitable for real-world deployment. (iii) By leveraging estimated intentions and an innovative algorithm for transforming trajectory observations, we obtain more robust trajectory representations that lead to superior prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world trajectory datasets for pedestrians and autonomous vehicles demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of INTENT.</p></details> |  |

However, existing local trajectory planning methods have difficulty planning trajectories with optimal velocity profiles at racetracks with sharp corners, thus weakening the performance of autonomous racing. To address this problem, we propose a local trajectory planning method that integrates Velocity Prediction based on Model Predictive Contouring Control (VPMPCC). The optimal parameters of VPMPCC are learned through Bayesian Optimization (BO) based on a proposed novel Objective Function adapted to Racing (OFR). Specifically, VPMPCC achieves velocity prediction by encoding the racetrack as a reference velocity profile and incorporating it into the optimization problem. This method optimizes the velocity profile of local trajectories, especially at corners with significant curvature. The proposed OFR balances racing performance with vehicle safety, ensuring safe and efficient BO training. In the simulation, the number of training iterations for OFR-based BO is reduced by 42.86% compared to the state-of-the-art method. The optimal simulation-trained parameters are then applied to a real-world F1TENTH vehicle without retraining. During prolonged racing on a custom-built racetrack featuring significant sharp corners, the mean projected velocity of VPMPCC reaches 93.18% of the vehicle's handling limits. The released code is available at https://github.com/zhouhengli/VPMPCC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pitch Plane Trajectory Tracking Control for Sounding Rockets via Adaptive Feedback Linearization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05285v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a pitch plane trajectory tacking control solution for suborbital launch vehicles relying on adaptive feedback linearization. Initially, the 2D dynamics and kinematics for a single-engine, thrust-vector-controlled sounding rocket are obtained for control design purposes. Then, an inner-outer control strategy, which simultaneously tackles attitude and position control, is adopted, with the inner-loop comprising the altitude and pitch control and the outer-loop addressing the horizontal (downrange) position control. Feedback linearization is used to cancel out the non-linearities in both the inner and outer dynamics. Making use of Lyapunov stability theory, an adaptation law, which provides online estimates on the inner-loop aerodynamic uncertainty, is jointly designed with the output tracking controller via adaptive backstepping, ensuring global reference tracking in the region where the feedback linearization is well-defined. The zero dynamics of the inner-stabilized system are then exploited to obtain the outerloop dynamics and derive a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) with integral action, which can stabilize them as well as reject external disturbances. In the outermost loop, the estimate on the correspondent aerodynamic uncertainty is indirectly obtained by using the inner loop estimates together with known aerodynamics relations. The resulting inner-outer position control solution is proven to be asymptotically stable in the region of interest. Using a single-stage sounding rocket, propelled by a liquid engine, as reference vehicle, different mission scenarios are tested in a simulation environment to verify the adaptability of the proposed control strategy. The system is able to track the requested trajectories while rejecting external wind disturbances. Furthermore, the need to re-tune the control gains in between different mission scenarios is minimal to none.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper presented at the IEEE Aerospace Conference 2025.

Real-world application of such a method involves consideration of surrounding environment conditions and movements such as Lane Change, collision avoidance, and lane merge. The focus of the paper is to develop and implement safe collision free highway Lane Change trajectory using high order polynomial for Highly Automated Driving Function (HADF). Planning is often considered as a higher-level process than control. Behavior Planning Module (BPM) is designed that plans the high-level driving actions like Lane Change maneuver to safely achieve the functionality of transverse guidance ensuring safety of the vehicle using motion planning in a scenario including environmental situation. Based on the recommendation received from the (BPM), the function will generate a desire corresponding trajectory. The proposed planning system is situation specific with polynomial based algorithm for same direction two lane highway scenario. To support the trajectory system polynomial curve can be used to reduces overall complexity and thereby allows rapid computation.

| **[From Pixels to Trajectory: Universal Adversarial Example Detection via Temporal Imprints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04853v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For the first time, we unveil discernible temporal (or historical) trajectory imprints resulting from adversarial example (AE) attacks. Standing in contrast to existing studies all focusing on spatial (or static) imprints within the targeted underlying victim models, we present a fresh temporal paradigm for understanding these attacks. Of paramount discovery is that these imprints are encapsulated within a single loss metric, spanning universally across diverse tasks such as classification and regression, and modalities including image, text, and audio. Recognizing the distinct nature of loss between adversarial and clean examples, we exploit this temporal imprint for AE detection by proposing TRAIT (TRaceable Adversarial temporal trajectory ImprinTs). TRAIT operates under minimal assumptions without prior knowledge of attacks, thereby framing the detection challenge as a one-class classification problem. However, detecting AEs is still challenged by significant overlaps between the constructed synthetic losses of adversarial and clean examples due to the absence of ground truth for incoming inputs. TRAIT addresses this challenge by converting the synthetic loss into a spectrum signature, using the technique of Fast Fourier Transform to highlight the discrepancies, drawing inspiration from the temporal nature of the imprints, analogous to time-series signals. Across 12 AE attacks including SMACK (USENIX Sec'2023), TRAIT demonstrates consistent outstanding performance across comprehensively evaluated modalities, tasks, datasets, and model architectures. In all scenarios, TRAIT achieves an AE detection accuracy exceeding 97%, often around 99%, while maintaining a false rejection rate of 1%. TRAIT remains effective under the formulated strong adaptive attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can We Optimize Deep RL Policy Weights as Trajectory Modeling?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04074v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning the optimal policy from a random network initialization is the theme of deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). As the scale of DRL training increases, treating DRL policy network weights as a new data modality and exploring the potential becomes appealing and possible. In this work, we focus on the policy learning path in deep RL, represented by the trajectory of network weights of historical policies, which reflects the evolvement of the policy learning process. Taking the idea of trajectory modeling with Transformer, we propose Transformer as Implicit Policy Learner (TIPL), which processes policy network weights in an autoregressive manner. We collect the policy learning path data by running independent RL training trials, with which we then train our TIPL model. In the experiments, we demonstrate that TIPL is able to fit the implicit dynamics of policy learning and perform the optimization of policy network by inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as an extended abstract to ICLR 2025 Workshop on Weight Space Learning (WSL)</p></details> |
| **[Poisoning Attacks to Local Differential Privacy Protocols for Trajectory Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07483v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory data, which tracks movements through geographic locations, is crucial for improving real-world applications. However, collecting such sensitive data raises considerable privacy concerns. Local differential privacy (LDP) offers a solution by allowing individuals to locally perturb their trajectory data before sharing it. Despite its privacy benefits, LDP protocols are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where attackers inject fake data to manipulate aggregated results. In this work, we make the first attempt to analyze vulnerabilities in several representative LDP trajectory protocols. We propose \textsc{TraP}, a heuristic algorithm for data \underline{P}oisoning attacks using a prefix-suffix method to optimize fake \underline{Tra}jectory selection, significantly reducing computational complexity. Our experimental results demonstrate that our attack can substantially increase target pattern occurrences in the perturbed trajectory dataset with few fake users. This study underscores the urgent need for robust defenses and better protocol designs to safeguard LDP trajectory data against malicious manipulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[TR-LLM: Integrating Trajectory Data for Scene-Aware LLM-Based Human Action Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03993v3)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of human behavior is crucial for AI systems to effectively support real-world applications, such as autonomous robots anticipating and assisting with human tasks. Real-world scenarios frequently present challenges such as occlusions and incomplete scene observations, which can compromise predictive accuracy. Thus, traditional video-based methods often struggle due to limited temporal and spatial perspectives. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative. Having been trained on a large text corpus describing human behaviors, LLMs likely encode plausible sequences of human actions in a home environment. However, LLMs, trained primarily on text data, lack inherent spatial awareness and real-time environmental perception. They struggle with understanding physical constraints and spatial geometry. Therefore, to be effective in a real-world spatial scenario, we propose a multimodal prediction framework that enhances LLM-based action prediction by integrating physical constraints derived from human trajectories. Our experiments demonstrate that combining LLM predictions with trajectory data significantly improves overall prediction performance. This enhancement is particularly notable in situations where the LLM receives limited scene information, highlighting the complementary nature of linguistic knowledge and physical constraints in understanding and anticipating human behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reusing Historical Trajectories in Natural Policy Gradient via Importance Sampling: Convergence and Convergence Rate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00675v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning provides a mathematical framework for learning-based control, whose success largely depends on the amount of data it can utilize. The efficient utilization of historical trajectories obtained from previous policies is essential for expediting policy optimization. Empirical evidence has shown that policy gradient methods based on importance sampling work well. However, existing literature often neglect the interdependence between trajectories from different iterations, and the good empirical performance lacks a rigorous theoretical justification. In this paper, we study a variant of the natural policy gradient method with reusing historical trajectories via importance sampling. We show that the bias of the proposed estimator of the gradient is asymptotically negligible, the resultant algorithm is convergent, and reusing past trajectories helps improve the convergence rate. We further apply the proposed estimator to popular policy optimization algorithms such as trust region policy optimization. Our theoretical results are verified on classical benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method uses a Dynamic Buffered Voronoi Cell (DBVC) and a Dynamic Inter-Visibility Cell (DIVC) to formulate the distributed trajectory generation. Specifically, the DBVC and the DIVC are time-variant spaces that prevent mutual collisions and occlusions among agents, while enabling them to maintain suitable distances from the moving target. We combine the DBVC and the DIVC with an efficient Bernstein polynomial motion primitive-based tracking generation method, which has been refined into a less conservative approach than in our previous work. The proposed algorithm can compute each agent's trajectory within several milliseconds on an Intel i7 desktop. We validate the tracking performance in challenging scenarios, including environments with dozens of obstacles.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Unified Human Localization and Trajectory Prediction with Monocular Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03535v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional human trajectory prediction models rely on clean curated data, requiring specialized equipment or manual labeling, which is often impractical for robotic applications. The existing predictors tend to overfit to clean observation affecting their robustness when used with noisy inputs. In this work, we propose MonoTransmotion (MT), a Transformer-based framework that uses only a monocular camera to jointly solve localization and prediction tasks. Our framework has two main modules: Bird's Eye View (BEV) localization and trajectory prediction. The BEV localization module estimates the position of a person using 2D human poses, enhanced by a novel directional loss for smoother sequential localizations. The trajectory prediction module predicts future motion from these estimates. We show that by jointly training both tasks with our unified framework, our method is more robust in real-world scenarios made of noisy inputs. We validate our MT network on both curated and non-curated datasets. On the curated dataset, MT achieves around 12% improvement over baseline models on BEV localization and trajectory prediction. On real-world non-curated dataset, experimental results indicate that MT maintains similar performance levels, highlighting its robustness and generalization capability.

| **[Coordinated Trajectories for Non-stop Flying Carriers Holding a Cable-Suspended Load](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03481v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multirotor UAVs have been typically considered for aerial manipulation, but their scarce endurance prevents long-lasting manipulation tasks. This work demonstrates that the non-stop flights of three or more carriers are compatible with holding a constant pose of a cable-suspended load, thus potentially enabling aerial manipulation with energy-efficient non-stop carriers. It also presents an algorithm for generating the coordinated non-stop trajectories. The proposed method builds upon two pillars: (1)~the choice of $n$ special linearly independent directions of internal forces within the $3n-6$-dimensional nullspace of the grasp matrix of the load, chosen as the edges of a Hamiltonian cycle on the graph that connects the cable attachment points on the load. Adjacent pairs of directions are used to generate $n$ forces evolving on distinct 2D affine subspaces, despite the attachment points being generically in 3D; (2)~the construction of elliptical trajectories within these subspaces by mapping, through appropriate graph coloring, each edge of the Hamiltonian cycle to a periodic coordinate while ensuring that no adjacent coordinates exhibit simultaneous zero derivatives. Combined with conditions for load statics and attachment point positions, these choices ensure that each of the $n$ force trajectories projects onto the corresponding cable constraint sphere with non-zero tangential velocity, enabling perpetual motion of the carriers while the load is still. The theoretical findings are validated through simulations and laboratory experiments with non-stopping multirotor UAVs.</p></details> |  |

For the overall system dynamics, a two-degrees-of-freedom (2-DOF) vehicle model is established and a two-point preview driver model is adopted. A dynamic authority allocation strategy based on cooperation level is proposed to combine the steering input of the human driver and the automatic controller. To make further improvements in the controller design, three main contributions are put forward. Firstly, the CNF controller is designed for trajectory tracking control with refined transient performance. Besides, the self-triggered rule is applied such that the system will update in discrete times to save computing resources and increase efficiency. Moreover, by introducing the data-based ADP algorithm, the optimal control problem can be solved through iteration using system input and output information, reducing the need for accurate knowledge of system dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed control method is validated through Carsim-Simulink co-simulations in diverse driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics (12 pages)</p></details> |

We also specify identifiability conditions insuring the $L^p$ convergence of the estimator.</p></details> |  |
| **[SEAL: Safety Enhanced Trajectory Planning and Control Framework for Quadrotor Flight in Complex Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03346v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For quadrotors, achieving safe and autonomous flight in complex environments with wind disturbances and dynamic obstacles still faces significant challenges. Most existing methods address wind disturbances in either trajectory planning or control, which may lead to hazardous situations during flight. The emergence of dynamic obstacles would further worsen the situation. Therefore, we propose an efficient and reliable framework for quadrotors that incorporates wind disturbance estimations during both the planning and control phases via a generalized proportional integral observer. First, we develop a real-time adaptive spatial-temporal trajectory planner that utilizes Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis for error dynamics resulting from wind disturbances. By considering the forward reachability sets propagation on an Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) map, safety is guaranteed. Additionally, a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) controller considering wind disturbance compensation is implemented for robust trajectory tracking. Simulation and real-world experiments verify the effectiveness of our framework. The video and supplementary material will be available at https://github.com/Ma29-HIT/SEAL/.</p></details> |  |

To guarantee safety and prevent collisions, autonomous vehicles must be capable of accurately predicting the trajectories of surrounding traffic agents. Over the past decade, significant efforts from both academia and industry have been dedicated to designing solutions for precise trajectory forecasting. These efforts have produced a diverse range of approaches, raising questions about the differences between these methods and whether trajectory prediction challenges have been fully addressed. This paper reviews a substantial portion of recent trajectory prediction methods and devises a taxonomy to classify existing solutions. A general overview of the prediction pipeline is also provided, covering input and output modalities, modeling features, and prediction paradigms discussed in the literature. In addition, the paper discusses active research areas within trajectory prediction, addresses the posed research questions, and highlights the remaining research gaps and challenges.</p></details> |  |

Currently, the inherent trade-off between constraint compliance and computational efficiency enhancement in UAV trajectory optimization problems has not been sufficiently addressed. To enhance the performance of UAV trajectory optimization, we propose a spatial-temporal iterative optimization framework. Firstly, B-splines are utilized to represent UAV trajectories, with rigorous safety assurance achieved through strict enforcement of constraints on control points. Subsequently, a set of QP-LP subproblems via spatial-temporal decoupling and constraint linearization is derived. Finally, an iterative optimization strategy incorporating guidance gradients is employed to obtain high-performance UAV trajectories in different scenarios. Both simulation and real-world experimental results validate the efficiency and high-performance of the proposed optimization framework in generating safe and fast trajectories.

While recent learning-based methods, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in specific scenarios, RL planners struggle with training inefficiencies and managing large-scale, real-world driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CarPlanner}, a \textbf{C}onsistent \textbf{a}uto-\textbf{r}egressive \textbf{Planner} that uses RL to generate multi-modal trajectories. The auto-regressive structure enables efficient large-scale RL training, while the incorporation of consistency ensures stable policy learning by maintaining coherent temporal consistency across time steps. Moreover, CarPlanner employs a generation-selection framework with an expert-guided reward function and an invariant-view module, simplifying RL training and enhancing policy performance. Extensive analysis demonstrates that our proposed RL framework effectively addresses the challenges of training efficiency and performance enhancement, positioning CarPlanner as a promising solution for trajectory planning in autonomous driving. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that the RL-based planner can surpass both IL- and rule-based state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) on the challenging large-scale real-world dataset nuPlan. Our proposed CarPlanner surpasses RL-, IL-, and rule-based SOTA approaches within this demanding dataset.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

We report on a soma design workshop that explored how our bodies could collide with telepresence robots, mobility aids, and a quadruped robot. Based on our findings, we employed soma trajectories to analyse collisions as extended experiences that negotiate key transitions of consent, preparation, launch, contact, ripple, sting, untangle, debris and reflect. We then employed these ideas to analyse two collision experiences, an accidental collision between a person and a drone, and the deliberate design of a robot to play with cats, revealing how real-world collisions involve the complex and ongoing entanglement of soma trajectories. We discuss how viewing collisions as entangled trajectories, or tangles, can be used analytically, as a design approach, and as a lens to broach ethical complexity.</p></details> | 32 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Sparse canonical correlation analysis for multiple measurements with latent trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15140v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Canonical Correlation Analysis, CCA, is a widely used multivariate method in omics research for integrating high dimensional datasets. CCA identifies hidden links by deriving linear projections of features maximally correlating datasets. For standard CCA, observations must be independent of each other. As a result, it cannot properly deal with repeated measurements. Current CCA extensions dealing with these challenges either perform CCA on summarized data or estimate correlations for each measurement. While these techniques factor in the correlation between measurements, they are sub-optimal for high dimensional analysis and exploiting this datas longitudinal qualities. We propose a novel extension of sparse CCA that incorporates time dynamics at the latent level through longitudinal models. This approach addresses the correlation of repeated measurements while drawing latent paths, focusing on dynamics in the correlation structures. To aid interpretability and computational efficiency, we implement a penalty to enforce fixed sparsity levels. We estimate these trajectories fitting longitudinal models to the low dimensional latent variables, leveraging the clustered structure of high dimensional datasets, thus exploring shared longitudinal latent mechanisms. Furthermore, modeling time in the latent space significantly reduces computational burden. We validate our models performance using simulated data and show its real world applicability with data from the Human Microbiome Project. Our CCA method for repeated measurements enables efficient estimation of canonical correlations across measurements for clustered data. Compared to existing methods, ours substantially reduces computational time in high dimensional analyses as well as provides longitudinal trajectories that yield interpretable and insightful results.</p></details> | 19 pages, 13 figures |

However, existing TUL methods are limited by high model complexity and poor learning of the effective representations of trajectories, rendering them ineffective in handling large-scale user trajectory data. In this work, we propose a novel $\underline{Scal}$abl$\underline{e}$ Trajectory-User Linking with dual-stream representation networks for large-scale $\underline{TUL}$ problem, named ScaleTUL. Specifically, ScaleTUL generates two views using temporal and spatial augmentations to exploit supervised contrastive learning framework to effectively capture the irregularities of trajectories. In each view, a dual-stream trajectory encoder, consisting of a long-term encoder and a short-term encoder, is designed to learn unified trajectory representations that fuse different temporal-spatial dependencies. Then, a TUL layer is used to associate the trajectories with the corresponding users in the representation space using a two-stage training model. Experimental results on check-in mobility datasets from three real-world cities and the nationwide U.S. demonstrate the superiority of ScaleTUL over state-of-the-art baselines for large-scale TUL tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Recent advances in constrained trajectory prediction focus on structured constraints by constructing optimization objectives. However, handling unstructured constraints is challenging due to the lack of differentiable formal definitions. To address this, we propose a novel method for constrained trajectory prediction using a conditional generative paradigm, named Controllable Trajectory Diffusion (CTD). The key idea is that any trajectory corresponds to a degree of conformity to a constraint. By quantifying this degree and treating it as a condition, a model can implicitly learn to predict trajectories under unstructured constraints. CTD employs a pre-trained scoring model to predict the degree of conformity (i.e., a score), and uses this score as a condition for a conditional diffusion model to generate trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that CTD achieves high accuracy on the ETH/UCY and SDD benchmarks. Qualitative analysis confirms that CTD ensures adherence to unstructured constraints and can predict trajectories that satisfy combinatorial constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>has b...</summary><p>has been accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |

| **[TraSCE: Trajectory Steering for Concept Erasure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07658v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have brought them to the public spotlight, becoming widely accessible and embraced by everyday users. However, these models have been shown to generate harmful content such as not-safe-for-work (NSFW) images. While approaches have been proposed to erase such abstract concepts from the models, jail-breaking techniques have succeeded in bypassing such safety measures. In this paper, we propose TraSCE, an approach to guide the diffusion trajectory away from generating harmful content. Our approach is based on negative prompting, but as we show in this paper, a widely used negative prompting strategy is not a complete solution and can easily be bypassed in some corner cases. To address this issue, we first propose using a specific formulation of negative prompting instead of the widely used one. Furthermore, we introduce a localized loss-based guidance that enhances the modified negative prompting technique by steering the diffusion trajectory. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks in removing harmful content, including ones proposed by red teams, and erasing artistic styles and objects. Our proposed approach does not require any training, weight modifications, or training data (either image or prompt), making it easier for model owners to erase new concepts.</p></details> |  |

However, since the solid state diffusional transformations that drive microstructure outcomes are governed by nonlinear ODEs in terms of temperature, which is itself governed by PDEs over the entire part domain, solving for the system inputs needed to achieve desired microstructure distributions has proven difficult. In this work, we present a trajectory optimization approach for spatial control of microstructure in metal AM, which we demonstrate by controlling the hardness of a low-alloy steel in electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF). To this end, we present models for thermal and microstructural dynamics. Next, we use experimental data to identify the parameters of the microstructure transformation dynamics. We then pose spatial microstructure control as a finite-horizon optimal control problem. The optimal power field trajectory is computed using an augmented Lagrangian differential dynamic programming (AL-DDP) method with GPU acceleration. The resulting time-varying power fields are then realized on an EB-PBF machine through an approximation scheme. Measurements of the resultant hardness shows that the optimized power field trajectory is able to closely produce the desired hardness distribution.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |
| **[A representational framework for learning and encoding structurally enriched trajectories in complex agent environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13194v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability of artificial intelligence agents to make optimal decisions and generalise them to different domains and tasks is compromised in complex scenarios. One way to address this issue has focused on learning efficient representations of the world and on how the actions of agents affect them, such as disentangled representations that exploit symmetries. Whereas such representations are procedurally efficient, they are based on the compression of low-level state-action transitions, which lack structural richness. To address this problem, we propose to enrich the agent's ontology and extend the traditional conceptualisation of trajectories to provide a more nuanced view of task execution. Structurally Enriched Trajectories (SETs) extend the encoding of sequences of states and their transitions by incorporating hierarchical relations between objects, interactions and affordances. SETs are built as multi-level graphs, providing a detailed representation of the agent dynamics and a transferable functional abstraction of the task. SETs are integrated into an architecture, Structurally Enriched Trajectory Learning and Encoding (SETLE), that employs a heterogeneous graph-based memory structure of multi-level relational dependencies essential for generalisation. Using reinforcement learning as a data generation tool, we demonstrate that SETLE can support downstream tasks, enabling agents to recognise task-relevant structural patterns across diverse environments.</p></details> |  |

Our approach integrates several novel contributions, including a tailored object detector optimized for high-altitude bird's-eye view perspectives, a unique track stabilization method that uses detected vehicle bounding boxes as exclusion masks during image registration, and an orthophoto and master frame-based georeferencing strategy that enhances consistent alignment across multiple drone viewpoints. Additionally, our framework features robust vehicle dimension estimation and detailed road segmentation, enabling comprehensive traffic analysis. Conducted in the Songdo International Business District, South Korea, the study utilized a multi-drone experiment covering 20 intersections, capturing approximately 12TB of 4K video data over four days. The framework produced two high-quality datasets: the Songdo Traffic dataset, comprising approximately 700,000 unique vehicle trajectories, and the Songdo Vision dataset, containing over 5,000 human-annotated images with about 300,000 vehicle instances in four classes. Comparisons with high-precision sensor data from an instrumented probe vehicle highlight the accuracy and consistency of our extraction pipeline in dense urban environments. The public release of Songdo Traffic and Songdo Vision, and the complete source code for the extraction pipeline, establishes new benchmarks in data quality, reproducibility, and scalability in traffic research. Results demonstrate the potential of integrating drone technology with advanced computer vision for precise and cost-effective urban traffic monitoring, providing valuable resources for developing intelligent transportation systems and enhancing traffic management strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Other Vehicle Trajectories Are Also Needed: A Driving World Model Unifies Ego-Other Vehicle Trajectories in Video Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09215v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced end-to-end autonomous driving systems predict other vehicles' motions and plan ego vehicle's trajectory. The world model that can foresee the outcome of the trajectory has been used to evaluate the end-to-end autonomous driving system. However, existing world models predominantly emphasize the trajectory of the ego vehicle and leave other vehicles uncontrollable. This limitation hinders their ability to realistically simulate the interaction between the ego vehicle and the driving scenario. In addition, it remains a challenge to match multiple trajectories with each vehicle in the video to control the video generation. To address above issues, a driving World Model named EOT-WM is proposed in this paper, unifying Ego-Other vehicle Trajectories in videos. Specifically, we first project ego and other vehicle trajectories in the BEV space into the image coordinate to match each trajectory with its corresponding vehicle in the video. Then, trajectory videos are encoded by the Spatial-Temporal Variational Auto Encoder to align with driving video latents spatially and temporally in the unified visual space. A trajectory-injected diffusion Transformer is further designed to denoise the noisy video latents for video generation with the guidance of ego-other vehicle trajectories. In addition, we propose a metric based on control latent similarity to evaluate the controllability of trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted on the nuScenes dataset, and the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 30% in FID and 55% in FVD. The model can also predict unseen driving scenes with self-produced trajectories.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[EMoTive: Event-guided Trajectory Modeling for 3D Motion Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11371v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual 3D motion estimation aims to infer the motion of 2D pixels in 3D space based on visual cues. The key challenge arises from depth variation induced spatio-temporal motion inconsistencies, disrupting the assumptions of local spatial or temporal motion smoothness in previous motion estimation frameworks. In contrast, event cameras offer new possibilities for 3D motion estimation through continuous adaptive pixel-level responses to scene changes. This paper presents EMoTive, a novel event-based framework that models spatio-temporal trajectories via event-guided non-uniform parametric curves, effectively characterizing locally heterogeneous spatio-temporal motion. Specifically, we first introduce Event Kymograph - an event projection method that leverages a continuous temporal projection kernel and decouples spatial observations to encode fine-grained temporal evolution explicitly. For motion representation, we introduce a density-aware adaptation mechanism to fuse spatial and temporal features under event guidance, coupled with a non-uniform rational curve parameterization framework to adaptively model heterogeneous trajectories. The final 3D motion estimation is achieved through multi-temporal sampling of parametric trajectories, yielding optical flow and depth motion fields. To facilitate evaluation, we introduce CarlaEvent3D, a multi-dynamic synthetic dataset for comprehensive validation. Extensive experiments on both this dataset and a real-world benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

The conventional approach is to enforce the dynamic model as a constraint. However, we show this approach leads to significantly redundant operations, as well as being heavily dependent on the state space representation. Specifically, we propose an intrinsic successive convexification methodology for optimal control on smooth manifolds. This so-called iSCvx is then applied to a representative example involving attitude trajectory optimization for a spacecraft subject to non-convex constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[CDKFormer: Contextual Deviation Knowledge-Based Transformer for Long-Tail Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12695v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the future movements of surrounding vehicles is essential for ensuring the safe operation and efficient navigation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in urban traffic environments. Existing vehicle trajectory prediction methods primarily focus on improving overall performance, yet they struggle to address long-tail scenarios effectively. This limitation often leads to poor predictions in rare cases, significantly increasing the risk of safety incidents. Taking Argoverse 2 motion forecasting dataset as an example, we first investigate the long-tail characteristics in trajectory samples from two perspectives, individual motion and group interaction, and deriving deviation features to distinguish abnormal from regular scenarios. On this basis, we propose CDKFormer, a Contextual Deviation Knowledge-based Transformer model for long-tail trajectory prediction. CDKFormer integrates an attention-based scene context fusion module to encode spatiotemporal interaction and road topology. An additional deviation feature fusion module is proposed to capture the dynamic deviations in the target vehicle status. We further introduce a dual query-based decoder, supported by a multi-stream decoder block, to sequentially decode heterogeneous scene deviation features and generate multimodal trajectory predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDKFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly enhancing prediction accuracy and robustness for long-tailed trajectories compared to existing methods, thus advancing the reliability of AVs in complex real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Power Swing Trajectory Influenced by Virtual Impedance-Based Current-Limiting Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12278v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grid-forming (GFM) inverter-based resources (IBRs) can emulate the external characteristics of synchronous generators (SGs) through appropriate control loop design. However, in systems with GFM IBRs, the apparent impedance trajectory under current limitation differs significantly from that of SG-based systems due to the limited overcurrent capability of power electronic devices. This difference challenges the power swing detection functions of distance relays designed for SG-based systems. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the apparent impedance trajectory over a full power swing cycle under two typical current-limiting strategies: variable virtual impedance (VI) and adaptive VI. The analysis reveals that the trajectory under VI current-limiting strategies differs significantly from that of a conventional SG. The results also indicate that the control parameters affect the characteristics of the trajectory. In addition, the new trajectories challenge conventional power swing detection functions, increasing the risk of malfunction. Furthermore, the implementation of VI leads to a deterioration in system stability. The theoretical analysis is further validated through simulations on the MATLAB/Simulink platform.</p></details> |  |
| **[D4orm: Multi-Robot Trajectories with Dynamics-aware Diffusion Denoised Deformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12204v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents an optimization method for generating kinodynamically feasible and collision-free multi-robot trajectories that exploits an incremental denoising scheme in diffusion models. Our key insight is that high-quality trajectories can be discovered merely by denoising noisy trajectories sampled from a distribution. This approach has no learning component, relying instead on only two ingredients: a dynamical model of the robots to obtain feasible trajectories via rollout, and a score function to guide denoising with Monte Carlo gradient approximation. The proposed framework iteratively optimizes the deformation from the previous round with this denoising process, allows \textit{anytime} refinement as time permits, supports different dynamics, and benefits from GPU acceleration. Our evaluations for differential-drive and holonomic teams with up to 16 robots in 2D and 3D worlds show its ability to discover high-quality solutions faster than other black-box optimization methods such as MPPI, approximately three times faster in a 3D holonomic case with 16 robots. As evidence for feasibility, we demonstrate zero-shot deployment of the planned trajectories on eight multirotors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Dataset Distillation by Matching Adversarial Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12069v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset distillation synthesizes compact datasets that enable models to achieve performance comparable to training on the original large-scale datasets. However, existing distillation methods overlook the robustness of the model, resulting in models that are vulnerable to adversarial attacks when trained on distilled data. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of ``robust dataset distillation", a novel paradigm that embeds adversarial robustness into the synthetic datasets during the distillation process. We propose Matching Adversarial Trajectories (MAT), a method that integrates adversarial training into trajectory-based dataset distillation. MAT incorporates adversarial samples during trajectory generation to obtain robust training trajectories, which are then used to guide the distillation process. As experimentally demonstrated, even through natural training on our distilled dataset, models can achieve enhanced adversarial robustness while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to existing distillation methods. Our work highlights robust dataset distillation as a new and important research direction and provides a strong baseline for future research to bridge the gap between efficient training and adversarial robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning a Fast Mixing Exogenous Block MDP using a Single Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03016v2)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In order to train agents that can quickly adapt to new objectives or reward functions, efficient unsupervised representation learning in sequential decision-making environments can be important. Frameworks such as the Exogenous Block Markov Decision Process (Ex-BMDP) have been proposed to formalize this representation-learning problem (Efroni et al., 2022b). In the Ex-BMDP framework, the agent's high-dimensional observations of the environment have two latent factors: a controllable factor, which evolves deterministically within a small state space according to the agent's actions, and an exogenous factor, which represents time-correlated noise, and can be highly complex. The goal of the representation learning problem is to learn an encoder that maps from observations into the controllable latent space, as well as the dynamics of this space. Efroni et al. (2022b) has shown that this is possible with a sample complexity that depends only on the size of the controllable latent space, and not on the size of the noise factor. However, this prior work has focused on the episodic setting, where the controllable latent state resets to a specific start state after a finite horizon. By contrast, if the agent can only interact with the environment in a single continuous trajectory, prior works have not established sample-complexity bounds. We propose STEEL, the first provably sample-efficient algorithm for learning the controllable dynamics of an Ex-BMDP from a single trajectory, in the function approximation setting. STEEL has a sample complexity that depends only on the sizes of the controllable latent space and the encoder function class, and (at worst linearly) on the mixing time of the exogenous noise factor. We prove that STEEL is correct and sample-efficient, and demonstrate STEEL on two toy problems. Code is available at: https://github.com/midi-lab/steel.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

While recent Imitation Learning (IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods have reduced the number of required demonstrations, they still rely on expert knowledge to collect high-quality data, limiting scalability and accessibility. We propose Sketch-to-Skill, a novel framework that leverages human-drawn 2D sketch trajectories to bootstrap and guide RL for robotic manipulation. Our approach extends beyond previous sketch-based methods, which were primarily focused on imitation learning or policy conditioning, limited to specific trained tasks. Sketch-to-Skill employs a Sketch-to-3D Trajectory Generator that translates 2D sketches into 3D trajectories, which are then used to autonomously collect initial demonstrations. We utilize these sketch-generated demonstrations in two ways: to pre-train an initial policy through behavior cloning and to refine this policy through RL with guided exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that Sketch-to-Skill achieves ~96% of the performance of the baseline model that leverages teleoperated demonstration data, while exceeding the performance of a pure reinforcement learning policy by ~170%, only from sketch inputs. This makes robotic manipulation learning more accessible and potentially broadens its applications across various domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Peiho...</summary><p>Peihong Yu and Amisha Bhaskar contributed equally to this work</p></details> |
| **[Curves Ahead: Enhancing the Steering Law for Complex Curved Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11914v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Steering Law has long been a fundamental model in predicting movement time for tasks involving navigating through constrained paths, such as in selecting sub-menu options, particularly for straight and circular arc trajectories. However, this does not reflect the complexities of real-world tasks where curvatures can vary arbitrarily, limiting its applications. This study aims to address this gap by introducing the total curvature parameter K into the equation to account for the overall curviness characteristic of a path. To validate this extension, we conducted a mouse-steering experiment on fixed-width paths with varying lengths and curviness levels. Our results demonstrate that the introduction of K significantly improves model fitness for movement time prediction over traditional models. These findings advance our understanding of movement in complex environments and support potential applications in fields like speech motor control and virtual navigation.</p></details> |  |

| **[A High-Speed Time-Optimal Trajectory Generation Strategy via a Two-layer Planning Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11072v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion planning and trajectory generation are crucial technologies in various domains including the control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), manipulators, and rockets. However, optimization-based real-time motion planning becomes increasingly challenging due to the problem's probable non-convexity and the inherent limitations of Non-Linear Programming algorithms. Highly nonlinear dynamics, obstacle avoidance constraints, and non-convex inputs can exacerbate these difficulties. To address these hurdles, this paper proposes a two-layer optimization algorithm for 2D vehicles by dynamically reformulating small time horizon convex programming subproblems, aiming to provide real-time guarantees for trajectory optimization. Our approach involves breaking down the original problem into small horizon-based planning cycles with fixed final times, referred to as planning cycles. Each planning cycle is then solved within a series of restricted convex sets identified by our customized search algorithms incrementally. The key benefits of our proposed algorithm include fast computation speeds and lower task time. We demonstrate these advantages through mathematical proofs under some moderate preconditions and experimental results.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, the potential of transformer-based diffusion models for effectively generating videos with controllable motion remains an area of limited exploration. This paper introduces Tora, the first trajectory-oriented DiT framework that concurrently integrates textual, visual, and trajectory conditions, thereby enabling scalable video generation with effective motion guidance. Specifically, Tora consists of a Trajectory Extractor (TE), a Spatial-Temporal DiT, and a Motion-guidance Fuser (MGF). The TE encodes arbitrary trajectories into hierarchical spacetime motion patches with a 3D motion compression network. The MGF integrates the motion patches into the DiT blocks to generate consistent videos that accurately follow designated trajectories. Our design aligns seamlessly with DiT's scalability, allowing precise control of video content's dynamics with diverse durations, aspect ratios, and resolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Tora excels in achieving high motion fidelity compared to the foundational DiT model, while also accurately simulating the complex movements of the physical world.

This paper introduces Trajectory Mamba, a novel efficient trajectory prediction framework based on the selective state-space model (SSM). Conventional attention-based models face the challenge of computational costs that grow quadratically with the number of targets, hindering their application in highly dynamic environments. In response, we leverage the SSM to redesign the self-attention mechanism in the encoder-decoder architecture, thereby achieving linear time complexity. To address the potential reduction in prediction accuracy resulting from modifications to the attention mechanism, we propose a joint polyline encoding strategy to better capture the associations between static and dynamic contexts, ultimately enhancing prediction accuracy. Additionally, to balance prediction accuracy and inference speed, we adopted the decoder that differs entirely from the encoder. Through cross-state space attention, all target agents share the scene context, allowing the SSM to interact with the shared scene representation during decoding, thus inferring different trajectories over the next prediction steps. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of inference speed and parameter efficiency on both the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets. It demonstrates a four-fold reduction in FLOPs compared to existing methods and reduces parameter count by over 40% while surpassing the performance of the vast majority of previous methods. These findings validate the effectiveness of Trajectory Mamba in trajectory prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

The ASV exhibits cyclic operation due to the nature of the solar profile, but weather patterns create inevitable disturbances in this profile. The nature of the problem results in a formulation where the satisfaction of pointwise-in-time state of charge constraints does not generally guarantee persistent feasibility, and the goal is to maximize information gathered over a very long (ultimately persistent) time duration. To address these challenges, we first use barrier functions to tighten pointwise-in-time state of charge constraints by the minimal amount necessary to achieve persistent feasibility. We then use indirect methods to derive a simple switching control law, where the optimal velocity is shown to be an undetermined constant value during each constraint-inactive time segment. To identify this optimal constant velocity (which can vary from one segment to the next), we employ an iterative learning approach. The result is a simple closed-form control law that does not require a solar forecast. We present simulation-based validation results, based on a model of the SeaTrac SP-48 ASV and solar data from the North Carolina coast. These simulation results show that the proposed methodology, which amounts to a closed-form controller and simple iterative learning update law, performs nearly as well as a model predictive control approach that requires an accurate future solar forecast and significantly greater computational capability.</p></details> |  |

Diseases evolve dynamically over time, and studying longitudinal observations of specific biomarkers can help to understand patients response to treatment and predict disease progression. We propose a novel iterative regression-based method to estimate changes in patients status within a cohort that includes censored patients, and illustrate it on clinical data from myeloma cases. We formulate the relapse time estimation problem in the framework of Piecewise Deterministic Markov processes (PDMP), where the Euclidean component is a surrogate biomarker for patient state. This approach enables continuous-time estimation of the status-change dates, which in turn allows for accurate inference of the relapse time distribution. A key challenge lies in the partial observability of the process, a complexity that has been rarely addressed in previous studies. . We evaluate the performance of our procedure through a simulation study and compare it with different approaches. This work is a proof of concept on biomarker trajectories with simple behaviour, but our method can easily be extended to more complex dynamics.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce TrajHF, a human feedback-driven finetuning framework for generative trajectory models, designed to align motion planning with diverse driving preferences. TrajHF incorporates multi-conditional denoiser and reinforcement learning with human feedback to refine multi-modal trajectory generation beyond conventional imitation learning. This enables better alignment with human driving preferences while maintaining safety and feasibility constraints. TrajHF achieves PDMS of 93.95 on NavSim benchmark, significantly exceeding other methods.

In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

Key operations such as conflict detection and resolution, aircraft anomaly monitoring, and the management of congested flight paths are increasingly reliant on this foundational technology, underscoring the urgent demand for intelligent solutions. The dynamics in airport terminal zones and crowded airspaces are intricate and ever-changing; however, current methodologies do not sufficiently account for the interactions among aircraft. To tackle these challenges, we propose DA-STGCN, an innovative spatiotemporal graph convolutional network that integrates a dual attention mechanism. Our model reconstructs the adjacency matrix through a self-attention approach, enhancing the capture of node correlations, and employs graph attention to distill spatiotemporal characteristics, thereby generating a probabilistic distribution of predicted trajectories. This novel adjacency matrix, reconstructed with the self-attention mechanism, is dynamically optimized throughout the network's training process, offering a more nuanced reflection of the inter-node relationships compared to traditional algorithms. The performance of the model is validated on two ADS-B datasets, one near the airport terminal area and the other in dense airspace. Experimental results demonstrate a notable improvement over current 4D trajectory prediction methods, achieving a 20% and 30% reduction in the Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), respectively. The incorporation of a Dual-Attention module has been shown to significantly enhance the extraction of node correlations, as verified by ablation experiments.</p></details> |  |

We design a novel flow matching loss function that not only ensures at least one of the $K$ sets of future trajectories is accurate but also encourages all $K$ sets of future trajectories to be diverse and plausible. Furthermore, by leveraging the implicit maximum likelihood estimation (IMLE), we propose a novel distillation method for flow models that only requires samples from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the real-world datasets, including SportVU NBA games, ETH-UCY, and SDD, demonstrate that both our teacher flow model and the IMLE-distilled student model achieve state-of-the-art performance.

To address this, we propose Loss Trajectory Correlation (LTC), a novel metric for coreset selection that identifies critical training samples driving generalization. $LTC$ quantifies the alignment between training sample loss trajectories and validation set loss trajectories, enabling the construction of compact, representative subsets. Unlike traditional methods with computational and storage overheads that are infeasible to scale to large datasets, $LTC$ achieves superior efficiency as it can be computed as a byproduct of training. Our results on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k show that $LTC$ consistently achieves accuracy on par with or surpassing state-of-the-art coreset selection methods, with any differences remaining under 1%. LTC also effectively transfers across various architectures, including ResNet, VGG, DenseNet, and Swin Transformer, with minimal performance degradation (<2%). Additionally, LTC offers insights into training dynamics, such as identifying aligned and conflicting sample behaviors, at a fraction of the computational cost of traditional methods. This framework paves the way for scalable coreset selection and efficient dataset optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Post-interactive Multimodal Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09366v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling the interactions among agents for trajectory prediction of autonomous driving has been challenging due to the inherent uncertainty in agents' behavior. The interactions involved in the predicted trajectories of agents, also called post-interactions, have rarely been considered in trajectory prediction models. To this end, we propose a coarse-to-fine Transformer for multimodal trajectory prediction, i.e., Pioformer, which explicitly extracts the post-interaction features to enhance the prediction accuracy. Specifically, we first build a Coarse Trajectory Network to generate coarse trajectories based on the observed trajectories and lane segments, in which the low-order interaction features are extracted with the graph neural networks. Next, we build a hypergraph neural network-based Trajectory Proposal Network to generate trajectory proposals, where the high-order interaction features are learned by the hypergraphs. Finally, the trajectory proposals are sent to the Proposal Refinement Network for further refinement. The observed trajectories and trajectory proposals are concatenated together as the inputs of the Proposal Refinement Network, in which the post-interaction features are learned by combining the previous interaction features and trajectory consistency features. Moreover, we propose a three-stage training scheme to facilitate the learning process. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse 1 dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method. Compared with the baseline HiVT-64, our model has reduced the prediction errors by 4.4%, 8.4%, 14.4%, 5.7% regarding metrics minADE6, minFDE6, MR6, and brier-minFDE6, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, existing fault-tolerant control methods exhibit significant oscillations during docking and separation, impacting system stability. To address this issue, we propose a novel fault-tolerant control reallocation method that adapts to arbitrary number of modular robots and their assembly formations. The algorithm redistributes the expected collective force and torque required for MARS to individual unit according to their moment arm relative to the center of MARS mass. Furthermore, We propose an agile trajectory planning method for MARS of arbitrary configurations, which is collision-avoiding and dynamically feasible. Our work represents the first comprehensive approach to enable fault-tolerant and collision avoidance flight for MARS.

| **[Learning Few-Step Diffusion Models by Trajectory Distribution Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06674v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accelerating diffusion model sampling is crucial for efficient AIGC deployment. While diffusion distillation methods -- based on distribution matching and trajectory matching -- reduce sampling to as few as one step, they fall short on complex tasks like text-to-image generation. Few-step generation offers a better balance between speed and quality, but existing approaches face a persistent trade-off: distribution matching lacks flexibility for multi-step sampling, while trajectory matching often yields suboptimal image quality. To bridge this gap, we propose learning few-step diffusion models by Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM), a unified distillation paradigm that combines the strengths of distribution and trajectory matching. Our method introduces a data-free score distillation objective, aligning the student's trajectory with the teacher's at the distribution level. Further, we develop a sampling-steps-aware objective that decouples learning targets across different steps, enabling more adjustable sampling. This approach supports both deterministic sampling for superior image quality and flexible multi-step adaptation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with remarkable efficiency. Our model, TDM, outperforms existing methods on various backbones, such as SDXL and PixArt-$\alpha$, delivering superior quality and significantly reduced training costs. In particular, our method distills PixArt-$\alpha$ into a 4-step generator that outperforms its teacher on real user preference at 1024 resolution. This is accomplished with 500 iterations and 2 A800 hours -- a mere 0.01% of the teacher's training cost. In addition, our proposed TDM can be extended to accelerate text-to-video diffusion. Notably, TDM can outperform its teacher model (CogVideoX-2B) by using only 4 NFE on VBench, improving the total score from 80.91 to 81.65.

While prior work established the worst case optimality of standard flow matching under Wasserstein distances, the theoretical guarantees for higher-order flow matching - which incorporates acceleration terms to refine sample trajectories - remain unexplored. In this paper, we bridge this gap by proving that higher-order flow matching preserves worst case optimality as a distribution estimator. We derive upper bounds on the estimation error for second-order flow matching, demonstrating that the convergence rates depend polynomially on the smoothness of the target distribution (quantified via Besov spaces) and key parameters of the ODE dynamics. Our analysis employs neural network approximations with carefully controlled depth, width, and sparsity to bound acceleration errors across both small and large time intervals, ultimately unifying these results into a general worst case optimal bound for all time steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2410.11261</p></details> |

In this paper, we present a novel framework for simultaneously designing trajectories of robots, objects, and contacts efficiently for contact-rich manipulation. We propose a hierarchical optimization framework where Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) selects optimal contacts between robot \& object using approximate dynamical constraints, and then a NonLinear Program (NLP) optimizes trajectory of the robot(s) and object considering full nonlinear constraints. We present a convex relaxation of bilinear constraints using binary encoding technique such that MILP can provide tighter solutions with better computational complexity. The proposed framework is evaluated on various manipulation tasks where it can reason about complex multi-contact interactions while providing computational advantages. We also demonstrate our framework in hardware experiments using a bimanual robot system.

| **[Conformal forecasting for surgical instrument trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04191v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting surgical instrument trajectories and predicting the next surgical action recently started to attract attention from the research community. Both these tasks are crucial for automation and assistance in endoscopy surgery. Given the safety-critical nature of these tasks, reliable uncertainty quantification is essential. Conformal prediction is a fast-growing and widely recognized framework for uncertainty estimation in machine learning and computer vision, offering distribution-free, theoretically valid prediction intervals. In this work, we explore the application of standard conformal prediction and conformalized quantile regression to estimate uncertainty in forecasting surgical instrument motion, i.e., predicting direction and magnitude of surgical instruments' future motion. We analyze and compare their coverage and interval sizes, assessing the impact of multiple hypothesis testing and correction methods. Additionally, we show how these techniques can be employed to produce useful uncertainty heatmaps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study applying conformal prediction to surgical guidance, marking an initial step toward constructing principled prediction intervals with formal coverage guarantees in this domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Unsupervised C-Uniform Trajectory Sampler with Applications to Model Predictive Path Integral Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05819v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sampling-based model predictive controllers generate trajectories by sampling control inputs from a fixed, simple distribution such as the normal or uniform distributions. This sampling method yields trajectory samples that are tightly clustered around a mean trajectory. This clustering behavior in turn, limits the exploration capability of the controller and reduces the likelihood of finding feasible solutions in complex environments. Recent work has attempted to address this problem by either reshaping the resulting trajectory distribution or increasing the sample entropy to enhance diversity and promote exploration. In our recent work, we introduced the concept of C-Uniform trajectory generation [1] which allows the computation of control input probabilities to generate trajectories that sample the configuration space uniformly. In this work, we first address the main limitation of this method: lack of scalability due to computational complexity. We introduce Neural C-Uniform, an unsupervised C-Uniform trajectory sampler that mitigates scalability issues by computing control input probabilities without relying on a discretized configuration space. Experiments show that Neural C-Uniform achieves a similar uniformity ratio to the original C-Uniform approach and generates trajectories over a longer time horizon while preserving uniformity. Next, we present CU-MPPI, which integrates Neural C-Uniform sampling into existing MPPI variants. We analyze the performance of CU-MPPI in simulation and real-world experiments. Our results indicate that in settings where the optimal solution has high curvature, CU-MPPI leads to drastic improvements in performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IROS2025</p></details> |

While learning-based prediction models have shown success in generating likely human trajectory predictions, integrating these stochastic models into a robot controller presents several challenges. The controller needs to account for interactive coupling between planned robot motion and human predictions while ensuring both predictions and robot actions are safe (i.e. collision-free). To address these challenges, we present a receding horizon crowd navigation method for single-robot multi-human environments. We first propose a diffusion model to generate joint trajectory predictions for all humans in the scene. We then incorporate these multi-modal predictions into a SICNav Bilevel MPC problem that simultaneously solves for a robot plan (upper-level) and acts as a safety filter to refine the predictions for non-collision (lower-level). Combining planning and prediction refinement into one bilevel problem ensures that the robot plan and human predictions are coupled. We validate the open-loop trajectory prediction performance of our diffusion model on the commonly used ETH/UCY benchmark and evaluate the closed-loop performance of our robot navigation method in simulation and extensive real-robot experiments demonstrating safe, efficient, and reactive robot motion.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid advancement in connected technologies, such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, valuable information from alternate views becomes accessible via wireless networks. The integration of information from alternative views has the potential to overcome the inherent limitations associated with a single viewpoint, such as occlusions and limited field of view. In this work, we introduce V2INet, a novel trajectory prediction framework designed to model multi-view data by extending existing single-view models. Unlike previous approaches where the multi-view data is manually fused or formulated as a separate training stage, our model supports end-to-end training, enhancing both flexibility and performance. Moreover, the predicted multimodal trajectories are calibrated by a post-hoc conformal prediction module to get valid and efficient confidence regions. We evaluated the entire framework using the real-world V2I dataset V2X-Seq. Our results demonstrate superior performance in terms of Final Displacement Error (FDE) and Miss Rate (MR) using a single GPU.

Current evaluation tasks like VQA and visual grounding remain too coarse to assess fine-grained pixel comprehension accurately. Though segmentation is foundational for pixel-level understanding, existing methods often require MLLMs to generate implicit tokens, decoded through external pixel decoders. This approach disrupts the MLLM's text output space, potentially compromising language capabilities and reducing flexibility and extensibility, while failing to reflect the model's intrinsic pixel-level understanding. Thus, we introduce the Human-Like Mask Annotation Task (HLMAT), a new paradigm where MLLMs mimic human annotators using interactive segmentation tools. Modeling segmentation as a multi-step Markov Decision Process, HLMAT enables MLLMs to iteratively generate text-based click points, achieving high-quality masks without architectural changes or implicit tokens. Through this setup, we develop SegAgent, a model fine-tuned on human-like annotation trajectories, which achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and supports additional tasks like mask refinement and annotation filtering. HLMAT provides a protocol for assessing fine-grained pixel understanding in MLLMs and introduces a vision-centric, multi-step decision-making task that facilitates exploration of MLLMs' visual reasoning abilities. Our adaptations of policy improvement method StaR and PRM-guided tree search further enhance model robustness in complex segmentation tasks, laying a foundation for future advancements in fine-grained visual perception and multi-step decision-making for MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR2...</summary><p>CVPR2025;Code will be released at \url{https://github.com/aim-uofa/SegAgent}</p></details> |
| **[Collaborative Uncertainty Benefits Multi-Agent Multi-Modal Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05195v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multi-modal multi-agent trajectory forecasting, two major challenges have not been fully tackled: 1) how to measure the uncertainty brought by the interaction module that causes correlations among the predicted trajectories of multiple agents; 2) how to rank the multiple predictions and select the optimal predicted trajectory. In order to handle these challenges, this work first proposes a novel concept, collaborative uncertainty (CU), which models the uncertainty resulting from interaction modules. Then we build a general CU-aware regression framework with an original permutation-equivariant uncertainty estimator to do both tasks of regression and uncertainty estimation. Further, we apply the proposed framework to current SOTA multi-agent multi-modal forecasting systems as a plugin module, which enables the SOTA systems to 1) estimate the uncertainty in the multi-agent multi-modal trajectory forecasting task; 2) rank the multiple predictions and select the optimal one based on the estimated uncertainty. We conduct extensive experiments on a synthetic dataset and two public large-scale multi-agent trajectory forecasting benchmarks. Experiments show that: 1) on the synthetic dataset, the CU-aware regression framework allows the model to appropriately approximate the ground-truth Laplace distribution; 2) on the multi-agent trajectory forecasting benchmarks, the CU-aware regression framework steadily helps SOTA systems improve their performances. Specially, the proposed framework helps VectorNet improve by 262 cm regarding the Final Displacement Error of the chosen optimal prediction on the nuScenes dataset; 3) for multi-agent multi-modal trajectory forecasting systems, prediction uncertainty is positively correlated with future stochasticity; and 4) the estimated CU values are highly related to the interactive information among agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2110.13947</p></details> |

The deformability of garments leads to a vast state space and complex dynamics, which complicates precise and fine-grained manipulation. Previous approaches often rely on predefined key points or demonstrations, limiting their generalization across diverse garment categories. This paper presents a framework, MetaFold, that disentangles task planning from action prediction, learning each independently to enhance model generalization. It employs language-guided point cloud trajectory generation for task planning and a low-level foundation model for action prediction. This structure facilitates multi-category learning, enabling the model to adapt flexibly to various user instructions and folding tasks.

In contrast, simple robotic grippers have low dexterity and fail to handle small objects effectively. This is why many automation tasks remain unsolved by robots. This paper presents an optimization-based framework for in-hand manipulation with a robotic hand equipped with compact Magnetic Tactile Sensors (MTSs). The small form factor of the robotic hand from Shadow Robot introduces challenges in estimating the state of the object while satisfying contact constraints. To address this, we formulate a trajectory optimization problem using Nonlinear Programming (NLP) for finger movements while ensuring contact points to change along the geometry of the fingers. Using the optimized trajectory from the solver, we implement and test an open-loop controller for rolling motion. To further enhance robustness and accuracy, we introduce a force controller for the fingers and a state estimator for the object utilizing MTSs. The proposed framework is validated through comparative experiments, showing that incorporating the force control with compliance consideration improves the accuracy and robustness of the rolling motion. Rolling an object with the force controller is 30\% more likely to succeed than running an open-loop controller.

Current OV-MOT methods typically rely primarily on instance-level detection and association, often overlooking trajectory information that is unique and essential for object tracking tasks. Utilizing trajectory information can enhance association stability and classification accuracy, especially in cases of occlusion and category ambiguity, thereby improving adaptability to novel classes. Thus motivated, in this paper we propose \textbf{TRACT}, an open-vocabulary tracker that leverages trajectory information to improve both object association and classification in OV-MOT. Specifically, we introduce a \textit{Trajectory Consistency Reinforcement} (\textbf{TCR}) strategy, that benefits tracking performance by improving target identity and category consistency. In addition, we present \textbf{TraCLIP}, a plug-and-play trajectory classification module. It integrates \textit{Trajectory Feature Aggregation} (\textbf{TFA}) and \textit{Trajectory Semantic Enrichment} (\textbf{TSE}) strategies to fully leverage trajectory information from visual and language perspectives for enhancing the classification results. Extensive experiments on OV-TAO show that our TRACT significantly improves tracking performance, highlighting trajectory information as a valuable asset for OV-MOT.

By collecting only a single input-state trajectory from the unknown system and satisfying a rank condition that ensures the system is persistently excited according to the Willems et al.'s fundamental lemma, TRUST aims to design either control Lyapunov functions (CLF) or control barrier certificates (CBC), along with their corresponding stability or safety controllers. The tool implements sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization programs solely based on data to enforce stability or safety properties across four system classes: (i) continuous-time nonlinear polynomial systems, (ii) continuous-time linear systems, (iii) discrete-time nonlinear polynomial systems, and (iv) discrete-time linear systems. TRUST is a Python-based web application featuring an intuitive, reactive graphic user interface (GUI) built with web technologies. It can be accessed at https://trust.tgo.dev or installed locally, and supports both manual data entry and data file uploads. Leveraging the power of the Python backend and a JavaScript frontend, TRUST is designed to be highly user-friendly and accessible across desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile devices. We apply TRUST to a set of physical benchmarks with unknown dynamics, ensuring either stability or safety properties across the four supported classes of models.</p></details> |  |

While motion capabilities and accurate localization for automated robots have rapidly developed, the challenge remains to generate efficient, smooth, comprehensive, and high-quality trajectories in these areas. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient planner for ground robots to autonomously navigate in large complex multi-layered architectural spaces. Considering that traversable regions typically include ground, slopes, and stairs, which are planar or nearly planar structures, we simplify the problem to navigation within and between complex intersecting planes. We first extract traversable planes from 3D point clouds through segmenting, merging, classifying, and connecting to build a plane-graph, which is lightweight but fully represents the traversable regions. We then build a trajectory optimization based on motion state trajectory and fully consider special constraints when crossing multi-layer planes to maximize the robot's maneuverability. We conduct experiments in simulated environments and test on a CubeTrack robot in real-world scenarios, validating the method's effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures, 2tables.

Due to the inherent uncertainty in vessel behavior, trajectory prediction systems must adopt a multimodal approach to accurately model potential future motion states. However, existing vessel trajectory prediction methods lack the ability to comprehensively model behavioral multi-modality. To better capture multimodal behavior in interactive scenarios, we propose modeling interactions as dynamic graphs, replacing traditional aggregation-based techniques that rely on vessel states. By leveraging the natural multimodal capabilities of diffusion models, we frame the trajectory prediction task as an inverse process of motion uncertainty diffusion, wherein uncertainties across potential navigational areas are progressively eliminated until the desired trajectories is produced. In summary, we pioneer the integration of Spatio-Temporal Graph (STG) with diffusion models in ship trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments on real Automatic Identification System (AIS) data validate the superiority of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been ACCEPTED as a FULL PAPER at DASFAA 2025</p></details> |

We prove linear convergence rates and rigorously evaluate our method on cell data characterized by bifurcations, merges, and trajectory splitting scenarios like $supercells$, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art trajectory inference and interpolation methods.

Ergodic trajectory optimization is an effective approach that generates coverage paths for problems related to robotic inspection, information gathering problems, and search and rescue. These optimization schemes compel the robot to spend time in a region proportional to the expected utility of visiting that region. Current methods for ergodic trajectory optimization rely on domain-specific knowledge, e.g., a defined utility map, and well-defined spatial basis functions to produce ergodic trajectories. Here, we present a generalization of ergodic trajectory optimization based on maximum mean discrepancy that requires only samples from the search domain. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to produce coverage trajectories on a variety of problem domains including robotic inspection of objects with differential kinematics constraints and on Lie groups without having access to domain specific knowledge. Furthermore, we show favorable computational scaling compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for ergodic trajectory optimization with a trade-off between domain specific knowledge and computational scaling, thus extending the versatility of ergodic coverage on a wider application domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages (excluding references), 1 table, 8 figures, submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Previous methods often struggle with content leakage and style misalignment, particularly when using image-driven approaches that aim to transfer precise styles. In this work, we introduce Trajectory Reset Attention Control (TRAC), a novel method that allows for high-quality style transfer while preserving content integrity. TRAC operates by resetting the denoising trajectory and enforcing attention control, thus enhancing content consistency while significantly reducing the computational costs against inversion-based methods. Additionally, a concept termed Style Medium is introduced to bridge the gap between content and style, enabling a more precise and harmonious transfer of stylistic elements. Building upon these concepts, we present a tuning-free framework that offers a stable, flexible, and efficient solution for both image and video style transfer. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework accommodates a wide range of stylized outputs, from precise content preservation to the production of visually striking results with vibrant and expressive styles.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains a challenge to accurately account for agents' intentions and social behaviors when forecasting, and in particular, to simulate the unique randomness within each of those components in an explainable and decoupled way. Inspired by vibration systems and their resonance properties, we propose the Resonance (short for Re) model to encode and forecast pedestrian trajectories in the form of ``co-vibrations''. It decomposes trajectory modifications and randomnesses into multiple vibration portions to simulate agents' reactions to each single cause, and forecasts trajectories as the superposition of these independent vibrations separately. Also, benefiting from such vibrations and their spectral properties, representations of social interactions can be learned by emulating the resonance phenomena, further enhancing its explainability. Experiments on multiple datasets have verified its usefulness both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel framework, RealTraj, that enhances the real-world applicability of trajectory forecasting. Our approach includes two training phases -- self-supervised pretraining on synthetic data and weakly-supervised fine-tuning with limited real-world data -- to minimize data collection efforts. To improve robustness to real-world errors, we focus on both model design and training objectives. Specifically, we present Det2TrajFormer, a trajectory forecasting model that remains invariant to tracking noise by using past detections as inputs. Additionally, we pretrain the model using multiple pretext tasks, which enhance robustness and improve forecasting performance based solely on detection data. Unlike previous trajectory forecasting methods, our approach fine-tunes the model using only ground-truth detections, reducing the need for costly person ID annotations. In the experiments, we comprehensively verify the effectiveness of the proposed method against the limitations, and the method outperforms state-of-the-art trajectory forecasting methods on multiple datasets.

Most ZS-ICL methods use large language models (LLMs) to generate (input, label) pairs as pseudo-demonstrations and leverage historical pseudo-demonstrations to help solve the current problem. They assume that problems are from the same task and traverse them in a random order. However, in real-world scenarios, problems usually come from diverse tasks, and only a few belong to the same task. The random traversing order may generate unreliable pseudo-demonstrations and lead to error accumulation. To address this problem, we reformulate ZS-ICL as a planning problem and propose a Demonstration-aware Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) approach (DAWN-ICL), which leverages MCTS to strategically plan the problem-solving trajectories for ZS-ICL. In addition, to achieve effective and efficient Q value estimation, we propose a novel demonstration-aware Q-value function and use it to enhance the selection phase and accelerate the expansion and simulation phases in MCTS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DAWN-ICL on in-domain and cross-domain scenarios, and it even outperforms ICL using human-annotated labels.

This work proposes the Fast and Safe Data-Driven Planner to address this challenge. Sparse Gaussian predictions are introduced to improve both the computational efficiency and accuracy of opponent predictions. Furthermore, the proposed approach employs a bi-level quadratic programming framework to generate an overtaking trajectory leveraging the opponent predictions. The first level uses polynomial fitting to generate a rough trajectory, from which reference states and control inputs are derived for the second level. The second level formulates a model predictive control optimization problem in the Frenet frame, generating a trajectory that satisfies both kinematic feasibility and safety.

| **[NLP-enabled Trajectory Map-matching in Urban Road Networks using a Transformer-based Encoder-decoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12460v4)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicular trajectory data from geolocation telematics is vital for analyzing urban mobility patterns. Map-matching aligns noisy, sparsely sampled GPS trajectories with digital road maps to reconstruct accurate vehicle paths. Traditional methods rely on geometric proximity, topology, and shortest-path heuristics, but they overlook two key factors: (1) drivers may prefer routes based on local road characteristics rather than shortest paths, revealing learnable shared preferences, and (2) GPS noise varies spatially due to multipath effects. These factors can reduce the effectiveness of conventional methods in complex scenarios and increase the effort required for heuristic-based implementations. This study introduces a data-driven, deep learning-based map-matching framework, formulating the task as machine translation, inspired by NLP. Specifically, a transformer-based encoder-decoder model learns contextual representations of noisy GPS points to infer trajectory behavior and road structures in an end-to-end manner. Trained on large-scale trajectory data, the method improves path estimation accuracy. Experiments on synthetic trajectories show that this approach outperforms conventional methods by integrating contextual awareness. Evaluation on real-world GPS traces from Manhattan, New York, achieves 75% accuracy in reconstructing navigated routes. These results highlight the effectiveness of transformers in capturing drivers' trajectory behaviors, spatial dependencies, and noise patterns, offering a scalable, robust solution for map-matching. This work contributes to advancing trajectory-driven foundation models for geospatial modeling and urban mobility applications.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

In this paper, inspired by topological planning, we propose a differentiable local homotopy invariant metric to model the interactions. By incorporating this topological metric as a constraint into multi-vehicle trajectory optimization, our framework is capable of generating multiple interactive trajectories from the same initial values, achieving controllable interactions as well as supporting user-designed interaction patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior optimality and efficiency over existing methods. We will release open-source code to advance relative research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Trajectory Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15429v3)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning safe behaviors without engaging in risky online interactions with the environment. Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[Evidential Uncertainty Estimation for Multi-Modal Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05274v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving, yet uncertainty in agent behavior and perception noise makes it inherently challenging. While multi-modal trajectory prediction models generate multiple plausible future paths with associated probabilities, effectively quantifying uncertainty remains an open problem. In this work, we propose a novel multi-modal trajectory prediction approach based on evidential deep learning that estimates both positional and mode probability uncertainty in real time. Our approach leverages a Normal Inverse Gamma distribution for positional uncertainty and a Dirichlet distribution for mode uncertainty. Unlike sampling-based methods, it infers both types of uncertainty in a single forward pass, significantly improving efficiency. Additionally, we experimented with uncertainty-driven importance sampling to improve training efficiency by prioritizing underrepresented high-uncertainty samples over redundant ones. We perform extensive evaluations of our method on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets, demonstrating that it provides reliable uncertainty estimates while maintaining high trajectory prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |

While diffusion models have shown promise in planning, they are limited to solving tasks similar to those seen in their training data. We propose CompDiffuser, a novel generative approach that can solve new tasks by learning to compositionally stitch together shorter trajectory chunks from previously seen tasks. Our key insight is modeling the trajectory distribution by subdividing it into overlapping chunks and learning their conditional relationships through a single bidirectional diffusion model. This allows information to propagate between segments during generation, ensuring physically consistent connections. We conduct experiments on benchmark tasks of various difficulties, covering different environment sizes, agent state dimension, trajectory types, training data quality, and show that CompDiffuser significantly outperforms existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://comp-diffuser.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Curb Your Attention: Causal Attention Gating for Robust Trajectory Prediction in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07191v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction models in autonomous driving are vulnerable to perturbations from non-causal agents whose actions should not affect the ego-agent's behavior. Such perturbations can lead to incorrect predictions of other agents' trajectories, potentially compromising the safety and efficiency of the ego-vehicle's decision-making process. Motivated by this challenge, we propose $\textit{Causal tRajecTory predICtion}$ $\textbf{(CRiTIC)}$, a novel model that utilizes a $\textit{Causal Discovery Network}$ to identify inter-agent causal relations over a window of past time steps. To incorporate discovered causal relationships, we propose a novel $\textit{Causal Attention Gating}$ mechanism to selectively filter information in the proposed Transformer-based architecture. We conduct extensive experiments on two autonomous driving benchmark datasets to evaluate the robustness of our model against non-causal perturbations and its generalization capacity. Our results indicate that the robustness of predictions can be improved by up to $\textbf{54%}$ without a significant detriment to prediction accuracy. Lastly, we demonstrate the superior domain generalizability of the proposed model, which achieves up to $\textbf{29%}$ improvement in cross-domain performance. These results underscore the potential of our model to enhance both robustness and generalization capacity for trajectory prediction in diverse autonomous driving domains.

| **[Quantifying and Modeling Driving Styles in Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04994v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory forecasting has become a popular deep learning task due to its relevance for scenario simulation for autonomous driving. Specifically, trajectory forecasting predicts the trajectory of a short-horizon future for specific human drivers in a particular traffic scenario. Robust and accurate future predictions can enable autonomous driving planners to optimize for low-risk and predictable outcomes for human drivers around them. Although some work has been done to model driving style in planning and personalized autonomous polices, a gap exists in explicitly modeling human driving styles for trajectory forecasting of human behavior. Human driving style is most certainly a correlating factor to decision making, especially in edge-case scenarios where risk is nontrivial, as justified by the large amount of traffic psychology literature on risky driving. So far, the current real-world datasets for trajectory forecasting lack insight on the variety of represented driving styles. While the datasets may represent real-world distributions of driving styles, we posit that fringe driving style types may also be correlated with edge-case safety scenarios. In this work, we conduct analyses on existing real-world trajectory datasets for driving and dissect these works from the lens of driving styles, which is often intangible and non-standardized.</p></details> |  |
| **[INTENT: Trajectory Prediction Framework with Intention-Guided Contrastive Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04952v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction of road agents (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles) is an essential prerequisite for various intelligent systems applications, such as autonomous driving and robotic navigation. Recent research highlights the importance of environmental contexts (e.g., maps) and the "multi-modality" of trajectories, leading to increasingly complex model structures. However, real-world deployments require lightweight models that can quickly migrate and adapt to new environments. Additionally, the core motivations of road agents, referred to as their intentions, deserves further exploration. In this study, we advocate that understanding and reasoning road agents' intention plays a key role in trajectory prediction tasks, and the main challenge is that the concept of intention is fuzzy and abstract. To this end, we present INTENT, an efficient intention-guided trajectory prediction model that relies solely on information contained in the road agent's trajectory. Our model distinguishes itself from existing models in several key aspects: (i) We explicitly model road agents' intentions through contrastive clustering, accommodating the fuzziness and abstraction of human intention in their trajectories. (ii) The proposed INTENT is based solely on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), resulting in reduced training and inference time, making it very efficient and more suitable for real-world deployment. (iii) By leveraging estimated intentions and an innovative algorithm for transforming trajectory observations, we obtain more robust trajectory representations that lead to superior prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world trajectory datasets for pedestrians and autonomous vehicles demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of INTENT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Algorithmic Considerations for Effective Global Search of Robust Low-Thrust Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00297v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing interest in the cislunar domain over the past decade has led to an increasing demand for low-thrust missions to key orbits within this region. These low-thrust missions, typically characterized by long thrust arcs, are highly susceptible to operational disruptions such as unforeseen thruster outages or missed thrust events. Consequently, there is a critical need for efficient trajectory design frameworks which incorporate robustness against such anomalies. In this study, we utilize a robust trajectory design framework to explore the solution space for the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) module to the Earth-Moon L2 Southern 9:2 Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit. We propose algorithmic enhancements to improve the global search for robust solutions, and present a comprehensive analysis of two approaches: a nonconditional approach which involves a purely random search for robust solutions versus a conditional approach which involves warm-starting the search for robust solutions using the non-robust solutions. Our results indicate that by using non-robust solutions as initial guesses for the robust solutions, it is possible to achieve significant improvements in both the rate of convergence and the robustness of the final solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>An up...</summary><p>An update to the paper is available on arxiv as "Sinha, A., Beeson, R.

| **[A Data-Driven Aggressive Autonomous Racing Framework Utilizing Local Trajectory Planning with Velocity Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11570v3)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of autonomous driving has boosted the research on autonomous racing. However, existing local trajectory planning methods have difficulty planning trajectories with optimal velocity profiles at racetracks with sharp corners, thus weakening the performance of autonomous racing. To address this problem, we propose a local trajectory planning method that integrates Velocity Prediction based on Model Predictive Contouring Control (VPMPCC). The optimal parameters of VPMPCC are learned through Bayesian Optimization (BO) based on a proposed novel Objective Function adapted to Racing (OFR). Specifically, VPMPCC achieves velocity prediction by encoding the racetrack as a reference velocity profile and incorporating it into the optimization problem. This method optimizes the velocity profile of local trajectories, especially at corners with significant curvature. The proposed OFR balances racing performance with vehicle safety, ensuring safe and efficient BO training. In the simulation, the number of training iterations for OFR-based BO is reduced by 42.86% compared to the state-of-the-art method. The optimal simulation-trained parameters are then applied to a real-world F1TENTH vehicle without retraining. During prolonged racing on a custom-built racetrack featuring significant sharp corners, the mean projected velocity of VPMPCC reaches 93.18% of the vehicle's handling limits. The released code is available at https://github.com/zhouhengli/VPMPCC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pitch Plane Trajectory Tracking Control for Sounding Rockets via Adaptive Feedback Linearization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05285v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a pitch plane trajectory tacking control solution for suborbital launch vehicles relying on adaptive feedback linearization. Initially, the 2D dynamics and kinematics for a single-engine, thrust-vector-controlled sounding rocket are obtained for control design purposes. Then, an inner-outer control strategy, which simultaneously tackles attitude and position control, is adopted, with the inner-loop comprising the altitude and pitch control and the outer-loop addressing the horizontal (downrange) position control. Feedback linearization is used to cancel out the non-linearities in both the inner and outer dynamics. Making use of Lyapunov stability theory, an adaptation law, which provides online estimates on the inner-loop aerodynamic uncertainty, is jointly designed with the output tracking controller via adaptive backstepping, ensuring global reference tracking in the region where the feedback linearization is well-defined. The zero dynamics of the inner-stabilized system are then exploited to obtain the outerloop dynamics and derive a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) with integral action, which can stabilize them as well as reject external disturbances. In the outermost loop, the estimate on the correspondent aerodynamic uncertainty is indirectly obtained by using the inner loop estimates together with known aerodynamics relations. The resulting inner-outer position control solution is proven to be asymptotically stable in the region of interest. Using a single-stage sounding rocket, propelled by a liquid engine, as reference vehicle, different mission scenarios are tested in a simulation environment to verify the adaptability of the proposed control strategy. The system is able to track the requested trajectories while rejecting external wind disturbances. Furthermore, the need to re-tune the control gains in between different mission scenarios is minimal to none.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper presented at the IEEE Aerospace Conference 2025.

| **[Simulation-based Analysis Of Highway Trajectory Planning Using High-Order Polynomial For Highly Automated Driving Function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04159v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the fundamental tasks of autonomous driving is safe trajectory planning, the task of deciding where the vehicle needs to drive, while avoiding obstacles, obeying safety rules, and respecting the fundamental limits of road. Real-world application of such a method involves consideration of surrounding environment conditions and movements such as Lane Change, collision avoidance, and lane merge. The focus of the paper is to develop and implement safe collision free highway Lane Change trajectory using high order polynomial for Highly Automated Driving Function (HADF). Planning is often considered as a higher-level process than control. Behavior Planning Module (BPM) is designed that plans the high-level driving actions like Lane Change maneuver to safely achieve the functionality of transverse guidance ensuring safety of the vehicle using motion planning in a scenario including environmental situation. Based on the recommendation received from the (BPM), the function will generate a desire corresponding trajectory. The proposed planning system is situation specific with polynomial based algorithm for same direction two lane highway scenario. To support the trajectory system polynomial curve can be used to reduces overall complexity and thereby allows rapid computation. The proposed Lane Change scenario is modeled, and results has been analyzed (verified and validate) through the MATLAB simulation environment. The method proposed in this paper has achieved a significant improvement in safety and stability of Lane Changing maneuver.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Pixels to Trajectory: Universal Adversarial Example Detection via Temporal Imprints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04853v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For the first time, we unveil discernible temporal (or historical) trajectory imprints resulting from adversarial example (AE) attacks. Standing in contrast to existing studies all focusing on spatial (or static) imprints within the targeted underlying victim models, we present a fresh temporal paradigm for understanding these attacks. Of paramount discovery is that these imprints are encapsulated within a single loss metric, spanning universally across diverse tasks such as classification and regression, and modalities including image, text, and audio. Recognizing the distinct nature of loss between adversarial and clean examples, we exploit this temporal imprint for AE detection by proposing TRAIT (TRaceable Adversarial temporal trajectory ImprinTs). TRAIT operates under minimal assumptions without prior knowledge of attacks, thereby framing the detection challenge as a one-class classification problem. However, detecting AEs is still challenged by significant overlaps between the constructed synthetic losses of adversarial and clean examples due to the absence of ground truth for incoming inputs. TRAIT addresses this challenge by converting the synthetic loss into a spectrum signature, using the technique of Fast Fourier Transform to highlight the discrepancies, drawing inspiration from the temporal nature of the imprints, analogous to time-series signals. Across 12 AE attacks including SMACK (USENIX Sec'2023), TRAIT demonstrates consistent outstanding performance across comprehensively evaluated modalities, tasks, datasets, and model architectures. In all scenarios, TRAIT achieves an AE detection accuracy exceeding 97%, often around 99%, while maintaining a false rejection rate of 1%. TRAIT remains effective under the formulated strong adaptive attacks.</p></details> |  |

As the scale of DRL training increases, treating DRL policy network weights as a new data modality and exploring the potential becomes appealing and possible. In this work, we focus on the policy learning path in deep RL, represented by the trajectory of network weights of historical policies, which reflects the evolvement of the policy learning process. Taking the idea of trajectory modeling with Transformer, we propose Transformer as Implicit Policy Learner (TIPL), which processes policy network weights in an autoregressive manner. We collect the policy learning path data by running independent RL training trials, with which we then train our TIPL model. In the experiments, we demonstrate that TIPL is able to fit the implicit dynamics of policy learning and perform the optimization of policy network by inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as an extended abstract to ICLR 2025 Workshop on Weight Space Learning (WSL)</p></details> |
| **[Poisoning Attacks to Local Differential Privacy Protocols for Trajectory Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07483v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory data, which tracks movements through geographic locations, is crucial for improving real-world applications. However, collecting such sensitive data raises considerable privacy concerns. Local differential privacy (LDP) offers a solution by allowing individuals to locally perturb their trajectory data before sharing it. Despite its privacy benefits, LDP protocols are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where attackers inject fake data to manipulate aggregated results. In this work, we make the first attempt to analyze vulnerabilities in several representative LDP trajectory protocols. We propose \textsc{TraP}, a heuristic algorithm for data \underline{P}oisoning attacks using a prefix-suffix method to optimize fake \underline{Tra}jectory selection, significantly reducing computational complexity. Our experimental results demonstrate that our attack can substantially increase target pattern occurrences in the perturbed trajectory dataset with few fake users. This study underscores the urgent need for robust defenses and better protocol designs to safeguard LDP trajectory data against malicious manipulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[TR-LLM: Integrating Trajectory Data for Scene-Aware LLM-Based Human Action Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03993v3)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of human behavior is crucial for AI systems to effectively support real-world applications, such as autonomous robots anticipating and assisting with human tasks. Real-world scenarios frequently present challenges such as occlusions and incomplete scene observations, which can compromise predictive accuracy. Thus, traditional video-based methods often struggle due to limited temporal and spatial perspectives. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative. Having been trained on a large text corpus describing human behaviors, LLMs likely encode plausible sequences of human actions in a home environment. However, LLMs, trained primarily on text data, lack inherent spatial awareness and real-time environmental perception. They struggle with understanding physical constraints and spatial geometry. Therefore, to be effective in a real-world spatial scenario, we propose a multimodal prediction framework that enhances LLM-based action prediction by integrating physical constraints derived from human trajectories. Our experiments demonstrate that combining LLM predictions with trajectory data significantly improves overall prediction performance. This enhancement is particularly notable in situations where the LLM receives limited scene information, highlighting the complementary nature of linguistic knowledge and physical constraints in understanding and anticipating human behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reusing Historical Trajectories in Natural Policy Gradient via Importance Sampling: Convergence and Convergence Rate](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00675v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning provides a mathematical framework for learning-based control, whose success largely depends on the amount of data it can utilize. The efficient utilization of historical trajectories obtained from previous policies is essential for expediting policy optimization. Empirical evidence has shown that policy gradient methods based on importance sampling work well. However, existing literature often neglect the interdependence between trajectories from different iterations, and the good empirical performance lacks a rigorous theoretical justification. In this paper, we study a variant of the natural policy gradient method with reusing historical trajectories via importance sampling. We show that the bias of the proposed estimator of the gradient is asymptotically negligible, the resultant algorithm is convergent, and reusing past trajectories helps improve the convergence rate. We further apply the proposed estimator to popular policy optimization algorithms such as trust region policy optimization. Our theoretical results are verified on classical benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

We combine the DBVC and the DIVC with an efficient Bernstein polynomial motion primitive-based tracking generation method, which has been refined into a less conservative approach than in our previous work. The proposed algorithm can compute each agent's trajectory within several milliseconds on an Intel i7 desktop. We validate the tracking performance in challenging scenarios, including environments with dozens of obstacles.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

The existing predictors tend to overfit to clean observation affecting their robustness when used with noisy inputs. In this work, we propose MonoTransmotion (MT), a Transformer-based framework that uses only a monocular camera to jointly solve localization and prediction tasks. Our framework has two main modules: Bird's Eye View (BEV) localization and trajectory prediction. The BEV localization module estimates the position of a person using 2D human poses, enhanced by a novel directional loss for smoother sequential localizations. The trajectory prediction module predicts future motion from these estimates. We show that by jointly training both tasks with our unified framework, our method is more robust in real-world scenarios made of noisy inputs. We validate our MT network on both curated and non-curated datasets. On the curated dataset, MT achieves around 12% improvement over baseline models on BEV localization and trajectory prediction. On real-world non-curated dataset, experimental results indicate that MT maintains similar performance levels, highlighting its robustness and generalization capability.

This work demonstrates that the non-stop flights of three or more carriers are compatible with holding a constant pose of a cable-suspended load, thus potentially enabling aerial manipulation with energy-efficient non-stop carriers. It also presents an algorithm for generating the coordinated non-stop trajectories. The proposed method builds upon two pillars: (1)~the choice of $n$ special linearly independent directions of internal forces within the $3n-6$-dimensional nullspace of the grasp matrix of the load, chosen as the edges of a Hamiltonian cycle on the graph that connects the cable attachment points on the load. Adjacent pairs of directions are used to generate $n$ forces evolving on distinct 2D affine subspaces, despite the attachment points being generically in 3D; (2)~the construction of elliptical trajectories within these subspaces by mapping, through appropriate graph coloring, each edge of the Hamiltonian cycle to a periodic coordinate while ensuring that no adjacent coordinates exhibit simultaneous zero derivatives. Combined with conditions for load statics and attachment point positions, these choices ensure that each of the $n$ force trajectories projects onto the corresponding cable constraint sphere with non-zero tangential velocity, enabling perpetual motion of the carriers while the load is still. The theoretical findings are validated through simulations and laboratory experiments with non-stopping multirotor UAVs.</p></details> |  |

For the overall system dynamics, a two-degrees-of-freedom (2-DOF) vehicle model is established and a two-point preview driver model is adopted. A dynamic authority allocation strategy based on cooperation level is proposed to combine the steering input of the human driver and the automatic controller. To make further improvements in the controller design, three main contributions are put forward. Firstly, the CNF controller is designed for trajectory tracking control with refined transient performance. Besides, the self-triggered rule is applied such that the system will update in discrete times to save computing resources and increase efficiency. Moreover, by introducing the data-based ADP algorithm, the optimal control problem can be solved through iteration using system input and output information, reducing the need for accurate knowledge of system dynamics.

Most existing methods address wind disturbances in either trajectory planning or control, which may lead to hazardous situations during flight. The emergence of dynamic obstacles would further worsen the situation. Therefore, we propose an efficient and reliable framework for quadrotors that incorporates wind disturbance estimations during both the planning and control phases via a generalized proportional integral observer. First, we develop a real-time adaptive spatial-temporal trajectory planner that utilizes Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis for error dynamics resulting from wind disturbances. By considering the forward reachability sets propagation on an Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) map, safety is guaranteed. Additionally, a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) controller considering wind disturbance compensation is implemented for robust trajectory tracking. Simulation and real-world experiments verify the effectiveness of our framework. The video and supplementary material will be available at https://github.com/Ma29-HIT/SEAL/.</p></details> |  |

Currently, the inherent trade-off between constraint compliance and computational efficiency enhancement in UAV trajectory optimization problems has not been sufficiently addressed. To enhance the performance of UAV trajectory optimization, we propose a spatial-temporal iterative optimization framework. Firstly, B-splines are utilized to represent UAV trajectories, with rigorous safety assurance achieved through strict enforcement of constraints on control points. Subsequently, a set of QP-LP subproblems via spatial-temporal decoupling and constraint linearization is derived. Finally, an iterative optimization strategy incorporating guidance gradients is employed to obtain high-performance UAV trajectories in different scenarios. Both simulation and real-world experimental results validate the efficiency and high-performance of the proposed optimization framework in generating safe and fast trajectories. Our source codes will be released for community reference at https://hitsz-mas.github.io/STORM</p></details> |  |
| **[CarPlanner: Consistent Auto-regressive Trajectory Planning for Large-scale Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19908v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning is vital for autonomous driving, ensuring safe and efficient navigation in complex environments. While recent learning-based methods, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in specific scenarios, RL planners struggle with training inefficiencies and managing large-scale, real-world driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CarPlanner}, a \textbf{C}onsistent \textbf{a}uto-\textbf{r}egressive \textbf{Planner} that uses RL to generate multi-modal trajectories. The auto-regressive structure enables efficient large-scale RL training, while the incorporation of consistency ensures stable policy learning by maintaining coherent temporal consistency across time steps. Moreover, CarPlanner employs a generation-selection framework with an expert-guided reward function and an invariant-view module, simplifying RL training and enhancing policy performance. Extensive analysis demonstrates that our proposed RL framework effectively addresses the challenges of training efficiency and performance enhancement, positioning CarPlanner as a promising solution for trajectory planning in autonomous driving. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that the RL-based planner can surpass both IL- and rule-based state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) on the challenging large-scale real-world dataset nuPlan. Our proposed CarPlanner surpasses RL-, IL-, and rule-based SOTA approaches within this demanding dataset.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

The lack of large-scale instruction datasets and the gigapixel scale of whole slide images (WSIs) pose significant developmental challenges. In this paper, we present SlideChat, the first vision-language assistant capable of understanding gigapixel whole-slide images, exhibiting excellent multimodal conversational capability and response complex instruction across diverse pathology scenarios. To support its development, we created SlideInstruction, the largest instruction-following dataset for WSIs consisting of 4.2K WSI captions and 176K VQA pairs with multiple categories. Furthermore, we propose SlideBench, a multimodal benchmark that incorporates captioning and VQA tasks to assess SlideChat's capabilities in varied clinical settings such as microscopy, diagnosis. Compared to both general and specialized MLLMs, SlideChat exhibits exceptional capabilities achieving state-of-the-art performance on 18 of 22 tasks. For example, it achieved an overall accuracy of 81.17% on SlideBench-VQA (TCGA), and 54.15% on SlideBench-VQA (BCNB). Our code, data, and model is publicly accessible at https://uni-medical.github.io/SlideChat.github.io.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |
| **[Automated Processing of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence Outputs in Deep Learning Models for Fault Diagnostics of Large Infrastructures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15415v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Learning (DL) models processing images to recognize the health state of large infrastructure components can exhibit biases and rely on non-causal shortcuts. eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) can address these issues but manually analyzing explanations generated by XAI techniques is time-consuming and prone to errors. This work proposes a novel framework that combines post-hoc explanations with semi-supervised learning to automatically identify anomalous explanations that deviate from those of correctly classified images and may therefore indicate model abnormal behaviors. This significantly reduces the workload for maintenance decision-makers, who only need to manually reclassify images flagged as having anomalous explanations. The proposed framework is applied to drone-collected images of insulator shells for power grid infrastructure monitoring, considering two different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), GradCAM explanations and Deep Semi-Supervised Anomaly Detection. The average classification accuracy on two faulty classes is improved by 8% and maintenance operators are required to manually reclassify only 15% of the images. We compare the proposed framework with a state-of-the-art approach based on the faithfulness metric: the experimental results obtained demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently achieves F_1 scores larger than those of the faithfulness-based approach. Additionally, the proposed framework successfully identifies correct classifications that result from non-causal shortcuts, such as the presence of ID tags printed on insulator shells.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predictable Scale: Part I -- Optimal Hyperparameter Scaling Law in Large Language Model Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04715v4)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse tasks are now well-established, yet their effective deployment necessitates careful hyperparameter optimization. Through extensive empirical studies involving grid searches across diverse configurations, we discover universal scaling laws governing these hyperparameters: optimal learning rate follows a power-law relationship with both model parameters and data sizes, while optimal batch size scales primarily with data sizes. Our analysis reveals a convex optimization landscape for hyperparameters under fixed models and data size conditions. This convexity implies an optimal hyperparameter plateau. We contribute a universal, plug-and-play optimal hyperparameter tool for the community. Its estimated values on the test set are merely 0.09% away from the globally optimal LLM performance found via an exhaustive search. These laws demonstrate remarkable robustness across variations in model sparsity, training data distribution, and model shape. To our best known, this is the first work that unifies different model shapes and structures, such as Mixture-of-Experts models and dense transformers, as well as establishes optimal hyperparameter scaling laws across diverse data distributions. This exhaustive optimization process demands substantial computational resources, utilizing nearly one million NVIDIA H800 GPU hours to train 3,700 LLMs of varying sizes and hyperparameters from scratch and consuming approximately 100 trillion tokens in total. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we will progressively release all loss measurements and model checkpoints through our designated repository https://step-law.github.io/</p></details> | 22 pages |

These models are now foundational to a wide range of applications, including conversational AI, recommendation systems, autonomous driving, content generation, medical diagnostics, and scientific discovery. However, their widespread deployment also exposes them to significant safety risks, raising concerns about robustness, reliability, and ethical implications. This survey provides a systematic review of current safety research on large models, covering Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Diffusion Models (DMs), and large-model-based Agents. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) We present a comprehensive taxonomy of safety threats to these models, including adversarial attacks, data poisoning, backdoor attacks, jailbreak and prompt injection attacks, energy-latency attacks, data and model extraction attacks, and emerging agent-specific threats. (2) We review defense strategies proposed for each type of attacks if available and summarize the commonly used datasets and benchmarks for safety research. (3) Building on this, we identify and discuss the open challenges in large model safety, emphasizing the need for comprehensive safety evaluations, scalable and effective defense mechanisms, and sustainable data practices. More importantly, we highlight the necessity of collective efforts from the research community and international collaboration. Our work can serve as a useful reference for researchers and practitioners, fostering the ongoing development of comprehensive defense systems and platforms to safeguard AI models.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages, 3 figures, 11 tables; GitHub: https://github.com/xingjunm/Awesome-Large-Model-Safety</p></details> |
| **[The Impact of Input Order Bias on Large Language Models for Software Fault Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18750v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in software engineering tasks such as Fault Localization (FL) and Automatic Program Repair (APR). This study investigates how input order and context size influence LLM performance in FL, a crucial step for many downstream software engineering tasks. We evaluate different method orderings using Kendall Tau distances, including "perfect" (where ground truths appear first) and "worst" (where ground truths appear last), across two benchmarks containing Java and Python projects. Our results reveal a strong order bias: in Java projects, Top-1 FL accuracy drops from 57% to 20% when reversing the order, while in Python projects, it decreases from 38% to approximately 3%. However, segmenting inputs into smaller contexts mitigates this bias, reducing the performance gap in FL from 22% and 6% to just 1% across both benchmarks. We replaced method names with semantically meaningful alternatives to determine whether this bias is due to data leakage. The observed trends remained consistent, suggesting that the bias is not caused by memorization from training data but rather by the inherent effect of input order. Additionally, we explored ordering methods based on traditional FL techniques and metrics, finding that DepGraph's ranking achieves 48% Top-1 accuracy, outperforming simpler approaches such as CallGraph(DFS). These findings highlight the importance of structuring inputs, managing context effectively, and selecting appropriate ordering strategies to enhance LLM performance in FL and other software engineering applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[EfficientLLaVA:Generalizable Auto-Pruning for Large Vision-language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15369v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While multimodal large language models demonstrate strong performance in complex reasoning tasks, they pose significant challenges related to model complexity during deployment, especially for resource-limited devices. In this paper, we propose an automatic pruning method for large vision-language models to enhance the efficiency of multimodal reasoning. Conventional methods rely on the training data of the original model to select the proper pruning ratio for different network components. However, these methods are impractical for large vision-language models due to the unaffordable search costs caused by web-scale training corpus. In contrast, our approach only leverages a small number of samples to search for the desired pruning policy by maximizing its generalization ability on unknown training data while maintaining the model accuracy, which enables the achievement of an optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for large visual language models. Specifically, we formulate the generalization gap of the pruning strategy using the structural risk minimization principle. Based on both task performance and generalization capability, we iteratively search for the optimal pruning policy within a given search space and optimize the vision projector to evolve the search space with higher upper bound of performance. We conduct extensive experiments on the ScienceQA, Vizwiz, MM-vet, and LLaVA-Bench datasets for the task of visual question answering. Using only 64 samples for pruning policy search, EfficientLLaVA achieves an accuracy of 83.05% on ScienceQA, along with a $\times$ 1.8 speedup compared to the dense LLaVA-v1.5-7B model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[SPILL: Domain-Adaptive Intent Clustering based on Selection and Pooling with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15351v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose Selection and Pooling with Large Language Models (SPILL), an intuitive and domain-adaptive method for intent clustering without fine-tuning. Existing embeddings-based clustering methods rely on a few labeled examples or unsupervised fine-tuning to optimize results for each new dataset, which makes them less generalizable to multiple datasets. Our goal is to make these existing embedders more generalizable to new domain datasets without further fine-tuning. Inspired by our theoretical derivation and simulation results on the effectiveness of sampling and pooling techniques, we view the clustering task as a small-scale selection problem. A good solution to this problem is associated with better clustering performance. Accordingly, we propose a two-stage approach: First, for each utterance (referred to as the seed), we derive its embedding using an existing embedder. Then, we apply a distance metric to select a pool of candidates close to the seed. Because the embedder is not optimized for new datasets, in the second stage, we use an LLM to further select utterances from these candidates that share the same intent as the seed. Finally, we pool these selected candidates with the seed to derive a refined embedding for the seed. We found that our method generally outperforms directly using an embedder, and it achieves comparable results to other state-of-the-art studies, even those that use much larger models and require fine-tuning, showing its strength and efficiency. Our results indicate that our method enables existing embedders to be further improved without additional fine-tuning, making them more adaptable to new domain datasets. Additionally, viewing the clustering task as a small-scale selection problem gives the potential of using LLMs to customize clustering tasks according to the user's goals.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Hierarchical Multi-Step Reward Models for Enhanced Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13551v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies show that Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong reasoning capabilities through supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. However, a key approach, the Process Reward Model (PRM), suffers from reward hacking, making it unreliable in identifying the best intermediate steps. In this paper, we propose a novel reward model approach, Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM), which evaluates both individual and consecutive reasoning steps from fine-grained and coarse-grained level. HRM performs better in assessing reasoning coherence and self-reflection, particularly when the previous reasoning step is incorrect. Furthermore, to address the inefficiency of autonomous generating PRM training data via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we introduce a lightweight and effective data augmentation strategy called Hierarchical Node Compression (HNC) based on node merging (combining two consecutive reasoning steps into one step) in the tree structure. This approach diversifies MCTS results for HRM with negligible computational overhead, enhancing label robustness by introducing noise. Empirical results on the PRM800K dataset demonstrate that HRM, in conjunction with HNC, achieves superior stability and reliability in evaluation compared to PRM. Furthermore, cross-domain evaluations on MATH500 and GSM8K confirm HRM's superior generalization and robustness across diverse reasoning tasks. The code for all experiments will be released at https: //github.com/tengwang0318/hierarchial_reward_model.</p></details> |  |

| **[Enabling Inclusive Systematic Reviews: Incorporating Preprint Articles with Large Language Model-Driven Evaluations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13857v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background. Systematic reviews in comparative effectiveness research require timely evidence synthesis. Preprints accelerate knowledge dissemination but vary in quality, posing challenges for systematic reviews. Methods. We propose AutoConfidence (automated confidence assessment), an advanced framework for predicting preprint publication, which reduces reliance on manual curation and expands the range of predictors, including three key advancements: (1) automated data extraction using natural language processing techniques, (2) semantic embeddings of titles and abstracts, and (3) large language model (LLM)-driven evaluation scores. Additionally, we employed two prediction models: a random forest classifier for binary outcome and a survival cure model that predicts both binary outcome and publication risk over time. Results. The random forest classifier achieved AUROC 0.692 with LLM-driven scores, improving to 0.733 with semantic embeddings and 0.747 with article usage metrics. The survival cure model reached AUROC 0.716 with LLM-driven scores, improving to 0.731 with semantic embeddings. For publication risk prediction, it achieved a concordance index of 0.658, increasing to 0.667 with semantic embeddings. Conclusion. Our study advances the framework for preprint publication prediction through automated data extraction and multiple feature integration. By combining semantic embeddings with LLM-driven evaluations, AutoConfidence enhances predictive performance while reducing manual annotation burden. The framework has the potential to facilitate systematic incorporation of preprint articles in evidence-based medicine, supporting researchers in more effective evaluation and utilization of preprint resources.</p></details> | 28 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Borsuk-Ulam and Replicable Learning of Large-Margin Halfspaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15294v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in learning theory have established that, for total concepts, list replicability, global stability, differentially private (DP) learnability, and shared-randomness replicability coincide precisely with the finiteness of the Littlestone dimension. Does the same hold for partial concept classes? We answer this question by studying the large-margin half-spaces class, which has bounded Littlestone dimension and is purely DP-learnable and shared-randomness replicable even in high dimensions. We prove that the list replicability number of $\gamma$-margin half-spaces satisfies \[ \frac{d}{2} + 1 \le \mathrm{LR}(H_{\gamma}^d) \le d, \] which increases with the dimension $d$. This reveals a surprising separation for partial concepts: list replicability and global stability do not follow from bounded Littlestone dimension, DP-learnability, or shared-randomness replicability. By applying our main theorem, we also answer the following open problems. - We prove that any disambiguation of an infinite-dimensional large-margin half-space to a total concept class has unbounded Littlestone dimension, answering an open question of Alon et al. (FOCS '21). - We prove that the maximum list-replicability number of any *finite* set of points and homogeneous half-spaces in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space is $d$, resolving a problem of Chase et al. (FOCS '23). - We prove that any disambiguation of the Gap Hamming Distance problem in the large gap regime has unbounded public-coin randomized communication complexity. This answers an open problem of Fang et al. (STOC '25). We prove the lower bound via a topological argument involving the local Borsuk-Ulam theorem of Chase et al. (STOC '24). For the upper bound, we design a learning rule that relies on certain triangulations of the cross-polytope and recent results on the generalization properties of SVM.</p></details> |  |

This is particularly challenging in problems under uncertainty and in Bayesian reasoning. With the new generation of large language models (LLMs) capable of reasoning using Chain-of-Thought (CoT), there is an excellent opportunity to learn with them as they explain their reasoning through a dialogue with their artificial internal voice. It is an engaging and excellent opportunity to learn Bayesian reasoning. Furthermore, given that different LLMs sometimes arrive at opposite solutions, CoT generates opportunities for deep learning by detailed comparisons of reasonings. However, unlike humans, we found that they do not autonomously explain using ecologically valid strategies like natural frequencies, whole objects, and embodied heuristics. This is unfortunate, as these strategies help humans avoid critical mistakes and have proven pedagogical value in Bayesian reasoning. In order to overcome these biases and aid understanding and learning, we included prompts that induce LLMs to use these strategies. We found that LLMs with CoT incorporate them but not consistently. They show persistent biases towards symbolic reasoning and avoidance or phobia of ecologically valid strategies.</p></details> | 24 pages, 3 figures |

However, existing co-clustering methods suffer from poor scalability and cannot handle large-scale data. This paper presents a novel and scalable co-clustering method designed to uncover intricate patterns in high-dimensional, large-scale datasets. Specifically, we first propose a large matrix partitioning algorithm that partitions a large matrix into smaller submatrices, enabling parallel co-clustering. This method employs a probabilistic model to optimize the configuration of submatrices, balancing the computational efficiency and depth of analysis. Additionally, we propose a hierarchical co-cluster merging algorithm that efficiently identifies and merges co-clusters from these submatrices, enhancing the robustness and reliability of the process. Extensive evaluations validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. Experimental results demonstrate a significant reduction in computation time, with an approximate 83% decrease for dense matrices and up to 30% for sparse matrices.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 figures |

Despite their importance, NFRs are often overlooked or difficult to identify, impacting software quality. To support requirements engineers in eliciting NFRs, we developed a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive quality-driven NFRs from functional requirements (FRs). Using a custom prompting technique within a Deno-based pipeline, the system identifies relevant quality attributes for each functional requirement and generates corresponding NFRs, aiding systematic integration. A crucial aspect is evaluating the quality and suitability of these generated requirements. Can LLMs produce high-quality NFR suggestions? Using 34 functional requirements - selected as a representative subset of 3,964 FRs-the LLMs inferred applicable attributes based on the ISO/IEC 25010:2023 standard, generating 1,593 NFRs. A horizontal evaluation covered three dimensions: NFR validity, applicability of quality attributes, and classification precision. Ten industry software quality evaluators, averaging 13 years of experience, assessed a subset for relevance and quality. The evaluation showed strong alignment between LLM-generated NFRs and expert assessments, with median validity and applicability scores of 5.0 (means: 4.63 and 4.59, respectively) on a 1-5 scale. In the classification task, 80.4% of LLM-assigned attributes matched expert choices, with 8.3% near misses and 11.3% mismatches. A comparative analysis of eight LLMs highlighted variations in performance, with gemini-1.5-pro exhibiting the highest attribute accuracy, while llama-3.3-70B achieved higher validity and applicability scores. These findings provide insights into the feasibility of using LLMs for automated NFR generation and lay the foundation for further exploration of AI-assisted requirements engineering.</p></details> | 11 pages |

This study explores how large language models (LLMs) can be effectively involved in word games and proposes a training-free framework. "Shei Shi Wo Di" or "Who is the Spy" in English, is a classic word game. Using this game as an example, we introduce a Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based scheduling framework to enable LLMs to achieve excellent performance in tasks such as inferring role words and disguising their identities. We evaluate the framework's performance based on game success rates and the accuracy of the LLM agents' analytical results. Experimental results affirm the framework's effectiveness, demonstrating notable improvements in LLM performance across multiple datasets. This work highlights the potential of LLMs in mastering situational reasoning and social interactions within structured game environments.

| **[Benchmarking Large Language Models for Handwritten Text Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15195v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional machine learning models for Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) rely on supervised training, requiring extensive manual annotations, and often produce errors due to the separation between layout and text processing. In contrast, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a general approach to recognizing diverse handwriting styles without the need for model-specific training. The study benchmarks various proprietary and open-source LLMs against Transkribus models, evaluating their performance on both modern and historical datasets written in English, French, German, and Italian. In addition, emphasis is placed on testing the models' ability to autonomously correct previously generated outputs. Findings indicate that proprietary models, especially Claude 3.5 Sonnet, outperform open-source alternatives in zero-shot settings. MLLMs achieve excellent results in recognizing modern handwriting and exhibit a preference for the English language due to their pre-training dataset composition. Comparisons with Transkribus show no consistent advantage for either approach. Moreover, LLMs demonstrate limited ability to autonomously correct errors in zero-shot transcriptions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Data Splitting for Holdout Cross-Validation in Large Covariance Matrix Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15186v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-validation is a statistical tool that can be used to improve large covariance matrix estimation. Although its efficiency is observed in practical applications, the theoretical reasons behind it remain largely intuitive, with formal proofs currently lacking. To carry on analytical analysis, we focus on the holdout method, a single iteration of cross-validation, rather than the traditional $k$-fold approach. We derive a closed-form expression for the estimation error when the population matrix follows a white inverse Wishart distribution, and we observe the optimal train-test split scales as the square root of the matrix dimension. For general population matrices, we connected the error to the variance of eigenvalues distribution, but approximations are necessary. Interestingly, in the high-dimensional asymptotic regime, both the holdout and $k$-fold cross-validation methods converge to the optimal estimator when the train-test ratio scales with the square root of the matrix dimension.</p></details> |  |

| **[High-Dimensional Interlingual Representations of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11280v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) trained on massive multilingual datasets hint at the formation of interlingual constructs--a shared subspace in the representation space. However, evidence regarding this phenomenon is mixed, leaving it unclear whether these models truly develop unified interlingual representations, or present a partially aligned constructs. We explore 31 diverse languages varying on their resource-levels, typologies, and geographical regions; and find that multilingual LLMs exhibit inconsistent cross-lingual alignments. To address this, we propose an interlingual representation framework identifying both the shared interlingual semantic subspace and fragmented components, existed due to representational limitations. We introduce Interlingual Local Overlap (ILO) score to quantify interlingual alignment by comparing the local neighborhood structures of high-dimensional representations. We utilize ILO to investigate the impact of single-language fine-tuning on the interlingual representations in multilingual LLMs. Our results indicate that training exclusively on a single language disrupts the alignment in early layers, while freezing these layers preserves the alignment of interlingual representations, leading to improved cross-lingual generalization. These results validate our framework and metric for evaluating interlingual representation, and further underscore that interlingual alignment is crucial for scalable multilingual learning.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies on the emergent properties of these models have revealed their high-level geometric understanding, in particular in the context of depth perception. However, it remains unclear how depth perception arises in these models without explicit depth supervision provided during pre-training. To investigate this, we examine whether the monocular depth cues, similar to those used by the human visual system, emerge in these models. We introduce a new benchmark, DepthCues, designed to evaluate depth cue understanding, and present findings across 20 diverse and representative pre-trained vision models. Our analysis shows that human-like depth cues emerge in more recent larger models. We also explore enhancing depth perception in large vision models by fine-tuning on DepthCues, and find that even without dense depth supervision, this improves depth estimation. To support further research, our benchmark and evaluation code will be made publicly available for studying depth perception in vision models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025.

Long-horizon tasks for quadrupeds are challenging since they require both a high-level understanding of the semantics of the problem for task planning and a broad range of locomotion and manipulation skills to interact with the environment. Our system builds a high-level reasoning layer with large language models, which generates hybrid discrete-continuous plans as robot code from task descriptions. It comprises multiple LLM agents: a semantic planner that sketches a plan, a parameter calculator that predicts arguments in the plan, a code generator that converts the plan into executable robot code, and a replanner that handles execution failures or human interventions. At the low level, we adopt reinforcement learning to train a set of motion planning and control skills to unleash the flexibility of quadrupeds for rich environment interactions. Our system is tested on long-horizon tasks that are infeasible to complete with one single skill. Simulation and real-world experiments show that it successfully figures out multi-step strategies and demonstrates non-trivial behaviors, including building tools or notifying a human for help. Demos are available on our project page: https://sites.google.com/view/long-horizon-robot.</p></details> |  |

While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved fast progress in this domain, existing approaches either demand significant computational resources or struggle with effective multi-modal integration. In this paper, we introduce DocLayLLM, an efficient multi-modal extension of LLMs specifically designed for TDU. By lightly integrating visual patch tokens and 2D positional tokens into LLMs' input and encoding the document content using the LLMs themselves, we fully take advantage of the document comprehension capability of LLMs and enhance their perception of OCR information. We have also deeply considered the role of chain-of-thought (CoT) and innovatively proposed the techniques of CoT Pre-training and CoT Annealing. Our DocLayLLM can achieve remarkable performances with lightweight training settings, showcasing its efficiency and effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that our DocLayLLM outperforms existing OCR-dependent methods and OCR-free competitors.

However, it still lacks a comprehensive benchmark designed to comprehensively assess LVLMs' discerning capabilities on forgery media. To fill this gap, we present Forensics-Bench, a new forgery detection evaluation benchmark suite to assess LVLMs across massive forgery detection tasks, requiring comprehensive recognition, location and reasoning capabilities on diverse forgeries. Forensics-Bench comprises 63,292 meticulously curated multi-choice visual questions, covering 112 unique forgery detection types from 5 perspectives: forgery semantics, forgery modalities, forgery tasks, forgery types and forgery models. We conduct thorough evaluations on 22 open-sourced LVLMs and 3 proprietary models GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, highlighting the significant challenges of comprehensive forgery detection posed by Forensics-Bench. We anticipate that Forensics-Bench will motivate the community to advance the frontier of LVLMs, striving for all-around forgery detectors in the era of AIGC.

Such practices also bring some difficulties, such as managing licensing, components and related security. One approach to handle those difficulties is to use Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs). While there have been studies on the readiness of practitioners to embrace SBOMs and on the SBOM tools ecosystem, a large scale study on SBOM practices based on SBOM files produced in the wild is still lacking. A starting point for such a study is a large dataset of SBOM files found in the wild. We introduce such a dataset, consisting of over 78 thousand unique SBOM files, deduplicated from those found in over 94 million repositories. We include metadata that contains the standard and format used, quality score generated by the tool sbomqs, number of revisions, filenames and provenance information. Finally, we give suggestions and examples of research that could bring new insights on assessing and improving SBOM real practices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing High-Quality Code Generation in Large Language Models with Comparative Prefix-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09020v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in commercial code completion engines, significantly enhancing coding efficiency and productivity. However, LLMs may generate code with quality issues that violate coding standards and best practices, such as poor code style and maintainability, even when the code is functionally correct. This necessitates additional effort from developers to improve the code, potentially negating the efficiency gains provided by LLMs. To address this problem, we propose a novel comparative prefix-tuning method for controllable high-quality code generation. Our method introduces a single, property-specific prefix that is prepended to the activations of the LLM, serving as a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning. Unlike existing methods that require training multiple prefixes, our approach trains only one prefix and leverages pairs of high-quality and low-quality code samples, introducing a sequence-level ranking loss to guide the model's training. This comparative approach enables the model to better understand the differences between high-quality and low-quality code, focusing on aspects that impact code quality. Additionally, we design a data construction pipeline to collect and annotate pairs of high-quality and low-quality code, facilitating effective training. Extensive experiments on the Code Llama 7B model demonstrate that our method improves code quality by over 100% in certain task categories, while maintaining functional correctness. We also conduct ablation studies and generalization experiments, confirming the effectiveness of our method's components and its strong generalization capability.</p></details> |  |

Existing evaluation methods face limitations due to the significant human workload required to design Q&A pairs for visual images, which inherently restricts the scale and scope of evaluations. Although automated MLLM-as-judge approaches attempt to reduce the human workload through automatic evaluations, they often introduce biases. To address these problems, we propose an Unsupervised Peer review MLLM Evaluation framework. It utilizes only image data, allowing models to automatically generate questions and conduct peer review assessments of answers from other models, effectively alleviating the reliance on human workload. Additionally, we introduce the vision-language scoring system to mitigate the bias issues, which focuses on three aspects: (i) response correctness; (ii) visual understanding and reasoning; and (iii) image-text correlation. Experimental results demonstrate that UPME achieves a Pearson correlation of 0.944 with human evaluations on the MMstar dataset and 0.814 on the ScienceQA dataset, indicating that our framework closely aligns with human-designed benchmarks and inherent human preferences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Targeting this problem, we introduce Visual Number Benchmark (VisNumBench) to evaluate the number sense abilities of MLLMs across a wide range of visual numerical tasks. VisNumBench consists of about 1,900 multiple-choice question-answer pairs derived from both synthetic and real-world visual data, covering seven visual numerical attributes and four types of visual numerical estimation tasks. Our experiments on VisNumBench led to the following key findings: (i) The 17 MLLMs we tested, including open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL and InternVL2.5, as well as proprietary models like GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash, perform significantly below human levels in number sense-related tasks. (ii) Multimodal mathematical models and multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) models did not exhibit significant improvements in number sense abilities. (iii) Stronger MLLMs with larger parameter sizes and broader general abilities demonstrate modest gains in number sense abilities. We believe VisNumBench will serve as a valuable resource for the research community, encouraging further advancements in enhancing MLLMs' number sense abilities.

| **[Expanding Chatbot Knowledge in Customer Service: Context-Aware Similar Question Generation Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12444v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Service chatbots play an important role in enhancing customer support by delivering timely responses to diverse queries. Traditionally, these chatbots rely on retrieval-based methods constrained by a predefined knowledge base of question-answer (QA) pairs to guarantee reliable responses. To effectively handle varied customer inquiries, augmenting the knowledge base with similar questions that maintain semantic consistency and linguistic variability is crucial. This paper presents methodologies for a novel approach that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating similar questions and selecting an optimal subset of questions for knowledge base augmentation in industrial chatbots. Specifically, we define the SQG task in the context of LLM training and propose a one-to-many objective that incorporates contextual information. We also introduce an optimization framework that selects a diverse subset of similar questions within predefined resource constraints. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over traditional methods, achieving greater semantic diversity while aligning with source QA pairs, with over 120% relative improvement in meeting business-specific requirements with human evaluation. Combined with several best practices, we provide a robust, application-driven solution for enhancing chatbot performance and improving customer service satisfaction.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, numerous data selection methods have been proposed to identify subsets of data that can effectively and efficiently enhance model performance. However, most of these methods focus on general data selection and tend to overlook the specific nuances of domain-related data. In this paper, we introduce MASS, a \textbf{MA}thematical data \textbf{S}election framework using the \textbf{S}kill graph for pretraining LLMs in the mathematical reasoning domain. By taking into account the unique characteristics of mathematics and reasoning, we construct a skill graph that captures the mathematical skills and their interrelations from a reference dataset. This skill graph guides us in assigning quality scores to the target dataset, enabling us to select the top-ranked subset which is further used to pretrain LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of MASS across different model sizes (1B and 7B) and pretraining datasets (web data and synthetic data). Specifically, in terms of efficiency, models trained on subsets selected by MASS can achieve similar performance to models trained on the original datasets, with a significant reduction in the number of trained tokens - ranging from 50\% to 70\% fewer tokens. In terms of effectiveness, when trained on the same amount of tokens, models trained on the data selected by MASS outperform those trained on the original datasets by 3.3\% to 5.9\%. These results underscore the potential of MASS to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of pretraining LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Despite the effectiveness of existing methods in evaluating image authenticity and locating forgeries, these approaches often lack human interpretability and do not fully address the growing complexity of synthetic data. To tackle these challenges, we introduce FakeVLM, a specialized large multimodal model designed for both general synthetic image and DeepFake detection tasks. FakeVLM not only excels in distinguishing real from fake images but also provides clear, natural language explanations for image artifacts, enhancing interpretability. Additionally, we present FakeClue, a comprehensive dataset containing over 100,000 images across seven categories, annotated with fine-grained artifact clues in natural language. FakeVLM demonstrates performance comparable to expert models while eliminating the need for additional classifiers, making it a robust solution for synthetic data detection. Extensive evaluations across multiple datasets confirm the superiority of FakeVLM in both authenticity classification and artifact explanation tasks, setting a new benchmark for synthetic image detection. The dataset and code will be released in: https://github.com/opendatalab/FakeVLM.</p></details> |  |

However, since feature extraction relies on learning-based models, its performance fundamentally depends on the training dataset or tasks. For practical scenarios, it is essential to design a model that demonstrates robust performance regardless of dataset or tasks. In this correspondence, we propose a novel text transmission model that selects and transmits only a few characters and recovers the missing characters at the receiver using a large language model (LLM). Additionally, we propose a novel importance character extractor (ICE), which selects transmitted characters to enhance LLM recovery performance. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed filter selection by ICE outperforms random filter selection, which selects transmitted characters randomly. Moreover, the proposed model exhibits robust performance across different datasets and tasks and outperforms traditional bit-based communication in low signal-to-noise ratio conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Existing datasets, however, often cover limited areas and are typically captured using a single platform. To address this gap, we present a diverse large-scale dataset specifically designed for 4D radar-based localization and mapping. This dataset was gathered using three different platforms: a handheld device, an e-bike, and an SUV, under a variety of environmental conditions, including clear days, nighttime, and heavy rain. The data collection occurred from September 2023 to February 2024, encompassing diverse settings such as roads in a vegetated campus and tunnels on highways. Each route was traversed multiple times to facilitate place recognition evaluations. The sensor suite included a 3D lidar, 4D radars, stereo cameras, consumer-grade IMUs, and a GNSS/INS system. Sensor data packets were synchronized to GNSS time using a two-step process including a convex-hull-based smoothing and a correlation-based correction. The reference motion for the platforms was generated by registering lidar scans to a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) point cloud map by a lidar inertial sequential localizer which supports forward and backward processing. The backward pass enables detailed quantitative and qualitative assessments of reference motion accuracy. To demonstrate the dataset's utility, we evaluated several state-of-the-art radar-based odometry and place recognition methods, indicating existing challenges in radar-based SLAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

With the growing popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs), there have been efforts to create LLM based conversational tutors which can expand the benefits of one to one tutoring to everyone. However, current LLMs are trained primarily to be helpful assistants and lack crucial pedagogical skills. For example, they often quickly reveal the solution to the student and fail to plan for a richer multi turn pedagogical interaction. To use LLMs in pedagogical settings, they need to be steered to use effective teaching strategies: a problem we introduce as Pedagogical Steering. We develop StratL, an algorithm to optimize LLM prompts and steer it to follow a predefined multi-turn tutoring plan represented as a transition graph. As a case study, we create a prototype tutor for high school math following Productive Failure (PF), an advanced and effective learning design. To validate our approach in a real-world setting, we run a field study with 17 high school students in Singapore and show that StratL succeeds in steering the LLM to follow the PF tutoring strategy. Finally, we highlight challenges in Pedagogical Steering of LLMs and offer opportunities for further improvements by publishing a dataset of PF problems and our code.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 10 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

In this sense, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as potential tools to automate feedback generation. However, their reliability and ability to identify reasoning errors in student code remain not well understood. This study evaluates the performance of four LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, GPT-4-Turbo, and Gemini-1.5-pro) on a benchmark dataset of 45 student solutions. We assessed the models' capacity to provide accurate and insightful feedback, particularly in identifying reasoning mistakes. Our analysis reveals that 63\% of feedback hints were accurate and complete, while 37\% contained mistakes, including incorrect line identification, flawed explanations, or hallucinated issues. These findings highlight the potential and limitations of LLMs in programming education and underscore the need for improvements to enhance reliability and minimize risks in educational applications.</p></details> |  |

LMMs specifically designed for this domain have demonstrated effective perception, planning, and prediction skills. However, many of these methods underutilize 3D spatial and temporal elements, relying mainly on image data. As a result, their effectiveness in dynamic driving environments is limited. We propose to integrate tracking information as an additional input to recover 3D spatial and temporal details that are not effectively captured in the images. We introduce a novel approach for embedding this tracking information into LMMs to enhance their spatiotemporal understanding of driving scenarios. By incorporating 3D tracking data through a track encoder, we enrich visual queries with crucial spatial and temporal cues while avoiding the computational overhead associated with processing lengthy video sequences or extensive 3D inputs. Moreover, we employ a self-supervised approach to pretrain the tracking encoder to provide LMMs with additional contextual information, significantly improving their performance in perception, planning, and prediction tasks for autonomous driving. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with a gain of 9.5% in accuracy, an increase of 7.04 points in the ChatGPT score, and 9.4% increase in the overall score over baseline models on DriveLM-nuScenes benchmark, along with a 3.7% final score improvement on DriveLM-CARLA.

However, real-world temporal graphs often possess rich textual information, giving rise to temporal text-attributed graphs (TTAGs). Such combination of dynamic text semantics and evolving graph structures introduces heightened complexity. Existing TGNNs embed texts statically and rely heavily on encoding mechanisms that biasedly prioritize structural information, overlooking the temporal evolution of text semantics and the essential interplay between semantics and structures for synergistic reinforcement. To tackle these issues, we present \textbf{{Cross}}, a novel framework that seamlessly extends existing TGNNs for TTAG modeling. The key idea is to employ the advanced large language models (LLMs) to extract the dynamic semantics in text space and then generate expressive representations unifying both semantics and structures. Specifically, we propose a Temporal Semantics Extractor in the {Cross} framework, which empowers the LLM to offer the temporal semantic understanding of node's evolving contexts of textual neighborhoods, facilitating semantic dynamics. Subsequently, we introduce the Semantic-structural Co-encoder, which collaborates with the above Extractor for synthesizing illuminating representations by jointly considering both semantic and structural information while encouraging their mutual reinforcement. Extensive experimental results on four public datasets and one practical industrial dataset demonstrate {Cross}'s significant effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> | Submit to ICML2025 |

These gestures significantly influence the addressee's engagement, recall, comprehension, and attitudes toward the speaker. Similarly, they impact interactions between humans and embodied virtual agents. The process of selecting and animating meaningful gestures has thus become a key focus in the design of these agents. However, automating this gesture selection process poses a significant challenge. Prior gesture generation techniques have varied from fully automated, data-driven methods, which often struggle to produce contextually meaningful gestures, to more manual approaches that require crafting specific gesture expertise and are time-consuming and lack generalizability. In this paper, we leverage the semantic capabilities of Large Language Models to develop a gesture selection approach that suggests meaningful, appropriate co-speech gestures. We first describe how information on gestures is encoded into GPT-4. Then, we conduct a study to evaluate alternative prompting approaches for their ability to select meaningful, contextually relevant gestures and to align them appropriately with the co-speech utterance. Finally, we detail and demonstrate how this approach has been implemented within a virtual agent system, automating the selection and subsequent animation of the selected gestures for enhanced human-agent interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, Accepted at the AAMAS 2025 conference</p></details> |

Unlike prior methods that focus solely on preserving facial identity, our approach captures detailed full-body appearance, aligning with text descriptions for body structure and scene variations. Training this model requires large-scale paired human data, consisting of multiple images per individual with consistent full-body identities, which is notoriously difficult to obtain. To address this, we propose a data curation pipeline leveraging vision-language models to evaluate full-body appearance consistency, resulting in Visual Persona-500K, a dataset of 580k paired human images across 100k unique identities. For precise appearance transfer, we introduce a transformer encoder-decoder architecture adapted to a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, which augments the input image into distinct body regions, encodes these regions as local appearance features, and projects them into dense identity embeddings independently to condition the diffusion model for synthesizing customized images. Visual Persona consistently surpasses existing approaches, generating high-quality, customized images from in-the-wild inputs. Extensive ablation studies validate design choices, and we demonstrate the versatility of Visual Persona across various downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, Project page is available at https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/Visual-Persona</p></details> |

While significant advances have been made in medical imaging, genetic biomarkers, and time series from electronic health records, the potential of FMs for patient behavior monitoring through wearable devices remains underexplored. These datasets are inherently heterogeneous, multisource, and often exhibit high rates of missing data, posing unique challenges. This paper introduces a novel FM based on a modified vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE), specifically designed to process real-world data from wearable devices. We demonstrate that our pretrained FM, trained on a broad cohort of psychiatric patients, performs downstream tasks via its latent representation without fine-tuning on a held-out cohort of suicidal patients. To illustrate this, we develop a probabilistic change-point detection algorithm for suicide detection and demonstrate the FM's effectiveness in predicting emotional states. Our results show that the discrete latent structure of the VQ-VAE outperforms a state-of-the-art Informer architecture in unsupervised suicide detection, while matching its performance in supervised emotion prediction when the latent dimensionality is increased, though at the cost of reduced unsupervised accuracy. This trade-off highlights the need for future FMs to integrate hybrid discrete-continuous structures for balanced performance across tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (31 with appendices), 6 figures (13 with appendices); submitted to UAI 2025</p></details> |

I leveraged the unique opportunity presented by an upcoming publication describing a novel catastrophic biothreat - "Technical Report on Mirror Bacteria: Feasibility and Risks" - to conduct a small controlled study before it became public. Graduate-trained biologists tasked with predicting the consequences of releasing mirror E. coli showed no significant differences in rubric-graded accuracy using Claude Sonnet 3.5 new (n=10) or web search only (n=2); both groups scored comparably to a web baseline (28 and 43 versus 36). However, Sonnet reasoned correctly when prompted by a report author, but a smaller model, Haiku 3.5, failed even with author guidance (80 versus 5). These results suggest distinct stages of model capability: Haiku is unable to reason about mirror life even with threat-aware expert guidance (Stage 1), while Sonnet correctly reasons only with threat-aware prompting (Stage 2). Continued advances may allow future models to disclose novel CBRN threats to naive experts (Stage 3) or unskilled users (Stage 4). While mirror life represents only one case study, monitoring new models' ability to reason about privately known threats may allow protective measures to be implemented before widespread disclosure.</p></details> | 26 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Towards Self-Improving Systematic Cognition for Next-Generation Foundation MLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12303v3)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their impressive capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) face challenges with fine-grained perception and complex reasoning. Prevalent multimodal pre-training approaches focus on enhancing perception by training on high-quality image captions due to the extremely high cost of collecting chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning data for improving reasoning. While leveraging advanced MLLMs for caption generation enhances scalability, the outputs often lack comprehensiveness and accuracy. In this paper, we introduce Self-Improving cognition (SIcog), a self-learning framework designed to construct next-generation foundation MLLMs by enhancing their systematic cognitive capabilities through multimodal pre-training with self-generated data. Specifically, we propose Chain-of-Description, an approach that improves an MLLM's systematic perception by enabling step-by-step visual understanding, ensuring greater comprehensiveness and accuracy. Additionally, we adopt a structured CoT reasoning technique to enable MLLMs to integrate in-depth multimodal reasoning. To construct a next-generation foundation MLLM with self-improved cognition, SIcog first equips an MLLM with systematic perception and reasoning abilities using minimal external annotations. The enhanced models then generate detailed captions and CoT reasoning data, which are further curated through self-consistency. This curated data is ultimately used for multimodal pre-training to develop next-generation foundation models. Extensive experiments on both low- and high-resolution MLLMs across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that, with merely 213K self-generated pre-training samples, SIcog produces next-generation foundation MLLMs with significantly improved cognition, achieving benchmark-leading performance compared to prevalent pre-training approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages.

However, several studies have revealed vulnerabilities in these models, such as generating unsafe content by text-to-image models. Existing benchmarks on multimodal models either predominantly assess the helpfulness of these models, or only focus on limited perspectives such as fairness and privacy. In this paper, we present the first unified platform, MMDT (Multimodal DecodingTrust), designed to provide a comprehensive safety and trustworthiness evaluation for MMFMs. Our platform assesses models from multiple perspectives, including safety, hallucination, fairness/bias, privacy, adversarial robustness, and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. We have designed various evaluation scenarios and red teaming algorithms under different tasks for each perspective to generate challenging data, forming a high-quality benchmark. We evaluate a range of multimodal models using MMDT, and our findings reveal a series of vulnerabilities and areas for improvement across these perspectives. This work introduces the first comprehensive and unique safety and trustworthiness evaluation platform for MMFMs, paving the way for developing safer and more reliable MMFMs and systems.

Recent advancements in humanoid robots have shown great promise as a hardware platform for building generalist autonomy in the human world. A robot foundation model, trained on massive and diverse data sources, is essential for enabling the robots to reason about novel situations, robustly handle real-world variability, and rapidly learn new tasks. To this end, we introduce GR00T N1, an open foundation model for humanoid robots. GR00T N1 is a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with a dual-system architecture. The vision-language module (System 2) interprets the environment through vision and language instructions. The subsequent diffusion transformer module (System 1) generates fluid motor actions in real time. Both modules are tightly coupled and jointly trained end-to-end. We train GR00T N1 with a heterogeneous mixture of real-robot trajectories, human videos, and synthetically generated datasets. We show that our generalist robot model GR00T N1 outperforms the state-of-the-art imitation learning baselines on standard simulation benchmarks across multiple robot embodiments. Furthermore, we deploy our model on the Fourier GR-1 humanoid robot for language-conditioned bimanual manipulation tasks, achieving strong performance with high data efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors are listed alphabetically.

However, existing segmentation models often struggle with generalizability across imaging modalities, and anatomical variations. In this work, we propose RoMedFormer, a rotary-embedding transformer-based foundation model designed for 3D female genito-pelvic structure segmentation in both MRI and CT. RoMedFormer leverages self-supervised learning and rotary positional embeddings to enhance spatial feature representation and capture long-range dependencies in 3D medical data. We pre-train our model using a diverse dataset of 3D MRI and CT scans and fine-tune it for downstream segmentation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that RoMedFormer achieves superior performance segmenting genito-pelvic organs. Our findings highlight the potential of transformer-based architectures in medical image segmentation and pave the way for more transferable segmentation frameworks.</p></details> |  |

Through systematic analysis, we uncover two fundamental limitations: Stable Diffusion (SD) struggles to extract meaningful features from abstract sketches (unlike its success with photos), and exhibits a pronounced frequency-domain bias that suppresses essential low-frequency components needed for sketch understanding. Rather than costly retraining, we address these limitations by strategically combining SD with CLIP, whose strong semantic understanding naturally compensates for SD's spatial-frequency biases. By dynamically injecting CLIP features into SD's denoising process and adaptively aggregating features across semantic levels, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in sketch retrieval (+3.35%), recognition (+1.06%), segmentation (+29.42%), and correspondence learning (+21.22%), demonstrating the first truly universal sketch feature representation in the era of foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025.

Despite recent advancements in foundation model adaptation to monocular depth estimation of endoscopic scenes via self-supervised learning (SSL), no prior work has explored their use for pose estimation. These methods rely on low rank-based adaptation approaches, which constrain model updates to a low-rank space. We propose Endo-FASt3r, the first monocular SSL depth and pose estimation framework that uses foundation models for both tasks. We extend the Reloc3r relative pose estimation foundation model by designing Reloc3rX, introducing modifications necessary for convergence in SSL. We also present DoMoRA, a novel adaptation technique that enables higher-rank updates and faster convergence. Experiments on the SCARED dataset show that Endo-FASt3r achieves a substantial $10\%$ improvement in pose estimation and a $2\%$ improvement in depth estimation over prior work. Similar performance gains on the Hamlyn and StereoMIS datasets reinforce the generalisability of Endo-FASt3r across different datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation Feature-Driven Online End-Effector Pose Estimation: A Marker-Free and Learning-Free Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14051v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate transformation estimation between camera space and robot space is essential. Traditional methods using markers for hand-eye calibration require offline image collection, limiting their suitability for online self-calibration. Recent learning-based robot pose estimation methods, while advancing online calibration, struggle with cross-robot generalization and require the robot to be fully visible. This work proposes a Foundation feature-driven online End-Effector Pose Estimation (FEEPE) algorithm, characterized by its training-free and cross end-effector generalization capabilities. Inspired by the zero-shot generalization capabilities of foundation models, FEEPE leverages pre-trained visual features to estimate 2D-3D correspondences derived from the CAD model and target image, enabling 6D pose estimation via the PnP algorithm. To resolve ambiguities from partial observations and symmetry, a multi-historical key frame enhanced pose optimization algorithm is introduced, utilizing temporal information for improved accuracy. Compared to traditional hand-eye calibration, FEEPE enables marker-free online calibration. Unlike robot pose estimation, it generalizes across robots and end-effectors in a training-free manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior flexibility, generalization, and performance.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, these connections have been focusing mostly on the relation between string theory and image processing and involve important theoretical paradigms such as holography. Recently G. Bianconi has proposed the entropic quantum gravity approach that proposes an action for gravity given by the quantum relative entropy between the metrics associated to a manifold. Here it is demonstrated that the famous Perona-Malik algorithm for image processing is the gradient flow of the entropic quantum gravity action. These results provide the geometrical and information theory foundations for the Perona-Malik algorithm and open new avenues for establishing fundamental relations between brain research, machine learning and entropic quantum gravity.</p></details> | (7 pages, 1 figure) |
| **[Towards Neural Scaling Laws for Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12360v3)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling laws offer valuable insights into the design of time series foundation models (TSFMs). However, previous research has largely focused on the scaling laws of TSFMs for in-distribution (ID) data, leaving their out-of-distribution (OOD) scaling behavior and the influence of model architectures less explored. In this work, we examine two common TSFM architectures, encoder-only and decoder-only Transformers, and investigate their scaling behavior on both ID and OOD data. These models are trained and evaluated across varying parameter counts, compute budgets, and dataset sizes. Our experiments reveal that the log-likelihood loss of TSFMs exhibits similar scaling behavior in both OOD and ID settings. We further compare the scaling properties across different architectures, incorporating two state-of-the-art TSFMs as case studies, showing that model architecture plays a significant role in scaling. The encoder-only Transformers demonstrate better scalability than the decoder-only Transformers, while the architectural enhancements in the two advanced TSFMs primarily improve ID performance but reduce OOD scalability. While scaling up TSFMs is expected to drive performance breakthroughs, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of TSFM scaling laws has hindered the development of a robust framework to guide model scaling. We fill this gap in this work by synthesizing our findings and providing practical guidelines for designing and scaling larger TSFMs with enhanced model capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Transfer Learning for Video-language Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11223v4)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models provide a robust foundation for efficient transfer learning across various downstream tasks. In the field of video action recognition, mainstream approaches often introduce additional modules to capture temporal information. Although the additional modules increase the capacity of model, enabling it to better capture video-specific inductive biases, existing methods typically introduce a substantial number of new parameters and are prone to catastrophic forgetting of previously acquired generalizable knowledge. In this paper, we propose a parameter-efficient Multi-modal Spatio-Temporal Adapter (MSTA) to enhance the alignment between textual and visual representations, achieving a balance between generalizable knowledge and task-specific adaptation. Furthermore, to mitigate over-fitting and enhance generalizability, we introduce a spatio-temporal description-guided consistency constraint.This constraint involves providing template inputs (e.g., "a video of \{\textbf{cls}\}") to the trainable language branch and LLM-generated spatio-temporal descriptions to the pre-trained language branch, enforcing output consistency between the branches. This approach reduces overfitting to downstream tasks and enhances the distinguishability of the trainable branch within the spatio-temporal semantic space. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach across four tasks: zero-shot transfer, few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and fully-supervised learning. Compared to many state-of-the-art methods, our MSTA achieves outstanding performance across all evaluations, while using only 2-7\% of the trainable parameters in the original model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Scalable Foundation Model for Multi-modal and Hyperspectral Geospatial Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12843v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geospatial raster data, such as that collected by satellite-based imaging systems at different times and spectral bands, hold immense potential for enabling a wide range of high-impact applications. This potential stems from the rich information that is spatially and temporally contextualized across multiple channels and sensing modalities. Recent work has adapted existing self-supervised learning approaches for such geospatial data. However, they fall short of scalable model architectures, leading to inflexibility and computational inefficiencies when faced with an increasing number of channels and modalities. To address these limitations, we introduce Low-rank Efficient Spatial-Spectral Vision Transformer with three key innovations: i) the LESS Attention Block that approximates high-dimensional spatial-spectral attention through Kronecker's product of the low-dimensional spatial and spectral attention components; ii) the Continuous Positional-Channel Embedding Layer that preserves both the continuity and physical characteristics of each spatial-spectral patch; and iii) the Perception Field Mask that exploits local spatial dependencies by constraining attention to neighboring patches. To evaluate the proposed innovations, we construct GFM-Bench, which serves as a comprehensive benchmark for such geospatial raster data. We pretrain LESS ViT using a Hyperspectral Masked Autoencoder framework with integrated positional and channel masking strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art multi-modal geospatial foundation models while outperforming them on cross-satellite generalization tasks with higher computational efficiency. The flexibility and extensibility of our framework make it a promising direction for future geospatial data analysis tasks that involve a wide range of modalities and channels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continual Unlearning for Foundational Text-to-Image Models without Generalization Erosion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13769v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How can we effectively unlearn selected concepts from pre-trained generative foundation models without resorting to extensive retraining? This research introduces `continual unlearning', a novel paradigm that enables the targeted removal of multiple specific concepts from foundational generative models, incrementally. We propose Decremental Unlearning without Generalization Erosion (DUGE) algorithm which selectively unlearns the generation of undesired concepts while preserving the generation of related, non-targeted concepts and alleviating generalization erosion. For this, DUGE targets three losses: a cross-attention loss that steers the focus towards images devoid of the target concept; a prior-preservation loss that safeguards knowledge related to non-target concepts; and a regularization loss that prevents the model from suffering from generalization erosion. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of the proposed approach to exclude certain concepts without compromising the overall integrity and performance of the model. This offers a pragmatic solution for refining generative models, adeptly handling the intricacies of model training and concept management lowering the risks of copyright infringement, personal or licensed material misuse, and replication of distinctive artistic styles. Importantly, it maintains the non-targeted concepts, thereby safeguarding the model's core capabilities and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under submission in T-PAMI</p></details> |

However, heterogeneity of electrocardiogram formats, limited access to deep learning model weights and intricate algorithmic steps for effective fine-tuning for own disease target labels result in complex workflows. In this work, we introduce ExChanGeAI, a web-based end-to-end platform that streamlines the reading of different formats, pre-processing, visualization and custom machine learning with local and privacy-preserving fine-tuning. ExChanGeAI is adaptable for use on both personal computers and scalable to high performance server environments.

A Holistic Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12990v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, histopathology vision-language foundation models (VLMs) have gained popularity due to their enhanced performance and generalizability across different downstream tasks. However, most existing histopathology benchmarks are either unimodal or limited in terms of diversity of clinical tasks, organs, and acquisition instruments, as well as their partial availability to the public due to patient data privacy. As a consequence, there is a lack of comprehensive evaluation of existing histopathology VLMs on a unified benchmark setting that better reflects a wide range of clinical scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce HistoVL, a fully open-source comprehensive benchmark comprising images acquired using up to 11 various acquisition tools that are paired with specifically crafted captions by incorporating class names and diverse pathology descriptions. Our Histo-VL includes 26 organs, 31 cancer types, and a wide variety of tissue obtained from 14 heterogeneous patient cohorts, totaling more than 5 million patches obtained from over 41K WSIs viewed under various magnification levels. We systematically evaluate existing histopathology VLMs on Histo-VL to simulate diverse tasks performed by experts in real-world clinical scenarios. Our analysis reveals interesting findings, including large sensitivity of most existing histopathology VLMs to textual changes with a drop in balanced accuracy of up to 25% in tasks such as Metastasis detection, low robustness to adversarial attacks, as well as improper calibration of models evident through high ECE values and low model prediction confidence, all of which can affect their clinical implementation.</p></details> |  |

However, due to their inherent representation biases originating from different training paradigms, VFMs exhibit advantages and disadvantages across distinct vision tasks. Although amalgamating the strengths of multiple VFMs for downstream tasks is an intuitive strategy, effectively exploiting these biases remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel and versatile "Swiss Army Knife" (SAK) solution, which adaptively distills knowledge from a committee of VFMs to enhance multi-task learning. Unlike existing methods that use a single backbone for knowledge transfer, our approach preserves the unique representation bias of each teacher by collaborating the lightweight Teacher-Specific Adapter Path modules with the Teacher-Agnostic Stem. Through dynamic selection and combination of representations with Mixture-of-Representations Routers, our SAK is capable of synergizing the complementary strengths of multiple VFMs. Extensive experiments show that our SAK remarkably outperforms prior state of the arts in multi-task learning by 10% on the NYUD-v2 benchmark, while also providing a flexible and robust framework that can readily accommodate more advanced model designs.

However, learning-based registration approaches lack generalizability across diverse clinical scenarios, requiring the laborious development of multiple isolated networks for specific registration tasks, e.g., inter-/intra-subject registration or organ-specific alignment. % To overcome this limitation, we propose \textbf{UniReg}, the first interactive foundation model for medical image registration, which combines the precision advantages of task-specific learning methods with the generalization of traditional optimization methods. Our key innovation is a unified framework for diverse registration scenarios, achieved through a conditional deformation field estimation within a unified registration model. This is realized through a dynamic learning paradigm that explicitly encodes: (1) anatomical structure priors, (2) registration type constraints (inter/intra-subject), and (3) instance-specific features, enabling the generation of scenario-optimal deformation fields. % Through comprehensive experiments encompassing $90$ anatomical structures at different body regions, our UniReg model demonstrates comparable performance with contemporary state-of-the-art methodologies while achieving ~50\% reduction in required training iterations relative to the conventional learning-based paradigm. This optimization contributes to a significant reduction in computational resources, such as training time. Code and model will be available.</p></details> |  |

However, without semantically fine-grained supervision, these models still encounter fundamental prediction errors in the context of downstream text-image-related tasks, i.e., perception, understanding and reasoning with images containing small and dense texts. To bridge this gap, we develop TokenOCR, the first token-level visual foundation model specifically tailored for text-image-related tasks, designed to support a variety of traditional downstream applications. To facilitate the pretraining of TokenOCR, we also devise a high-quality data production pipeline that constructs the first token-level image text dataset, TokenIT, comprising 20 million images and 1.8 billion token-mask pairs. Furthermore, leveraging this foundation with exceptional image-as-text capability, we seamlessly replace previous VFMs with TokenOCR to construct a document-level MLLM, TokenVL, for VQA-based document understanding tasks. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenOCR and TokenVL.

However, most existing models focus on short-span perception tasks, lacking the long-term reasoning required for CE detection. CEs consist of sequences of short-time atomic events (AEs) governed by spatiotemporal dependencies. Detecting them is difficult due to long, noisy sensor data and the challenge of filtering out irrelevant AEs while capturing meaningful patterns. This work explores CE detection as a case study for CPS-IoT foundation models capable of long-term reasoning. We evaluate three approaches: (1) leveraging large language models (LLMs), (2) employing various neural architectures that learn CE rules from data, and (3) adopting a neurosymbolic approach that integrates neural models with symbolic engines embedding human knowledge. Our results show that the state-space model, Mamba, which belongs to the second category, outperforms all methods in accuracy and generalization to longer, unseen sensor traces. These findings suggest that state-space models could be a strong backbone for CPS-IoT foundation models for long-span reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Impact of Noisy Supervision in Foundation Model Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06869v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are usually pre-trained on large-scale datasets and then adapted to downstream tasks through tuning. However, the large-scale pre-training datasets, often inaccessible or too expensive to handle, can contain label noise that may adversely affect the generalization of the model and pose unexpected risks. This paper stands out as the first work to comprehensively understand and analyze the nature of noise in pre-training datasets and then effectively mitigate its impacts on downstream tasks. Specifically, through extensive experiments of fully-supervised and image-text contrastive pre-training on synthetic noisy ImageNet-1K, YFCC15M, and CC12M datasets, we demonstrate that, while slight noise in pre-training can benefit in-domain (ID) performance, where the training and testing data share a similar distribution, it always deteriorates out-of-domain (OOD) performance, where training and testing distributions are significantly different. These observations are agnostic to scales of pre-training datasets, pre-training noise types, model architectures, pre-training objectives, downstream tuning methods, and downstream applications. We empirically ascertain that the reason behind this is that the pre-training noise shapes the feature space differently. We then propose a tuning method (NMTune) to affine the feature space to mitigate the malignant effect of noise and improve generalization, which is applicable in both parameter-efficient and black-box tuning manners. We additionally conduct extensive experiments on popular vision and language models, including APIs, which are supervised and self-supervised pre-trained on realistic noisy data for evaluation. Our analysis and results demonstrate the importance of this novel and fundamental research direction, which we term as Noisy Model Learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 10 figures, 6 tables, preprint. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2309.17002</p></details> |
| **[Towards a Unified Copernicus Foundation Model for Earth Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11849v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in Earth observation (EO) foundation models have unlocked the potential of big satellite data to learn generic representations from space, benefiting a wide range of downstream applications crucial to our planet. However, most existing efforts remain limited to fixed spectral sensors, focus solely on the Earth's surface, and overlook valuable metadata beyond imagery. In this work, we take a step towards next-generation EO foundation models with three key components: 1) Copernicus-Pretrain, a massive-scale pretraining dataset that integrates 18.7M aligned images from all major Copernicus Sentinel missions, spanning from the Earth's surface to its atmosphere; 2) Copernicus-FM, a unified foundation model capable of processing any spectral or non-spectral sensor modality using extended dynamic hypernetworks and flexible metadata encoding; and 3) Copernicus-Bench, a systematic evaluation benchmark with 15 hierarchical downstream tasks ranging from preprocessing to specialized applications for each Sentinel mission. Our dataset, model, and benchmark greatly improve the scalability, versatility, and multimodal adaptability of EO foundation models, while also creating new opportunities to connect EO, weather, and climate research.

| **[vesselFM: A Foundation Model for Universal 3D Blood Vessel Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17386v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segmenting 3D blood vessels is a critical yet challenging task in medical image analysis. This is due to significant imaging modality-specific variations in artifacts, vascular patterns and scales, signal-to-noise ratios, and background tissues. These variations, along with domain gaps arising from varying imaging protocols, limit the generalization of existing supervised learning-based methods, requiring tedious voxel-level annotations for each dataset separately. While foundation models promise to alleviate this limitation, they typically fail to generalize to the task of blood vessel segmentation, posing a unique, complex problem. In this work, we present vesselFM, a foundation model designed specifically for the broad task of 3D blood vessel segmentation. Unlike previous models, vesselFM can effortlessly generalize to unseen domains. To achieve zero-shot generalization, we train vesselFM on three heterogeneous data sources: a large, curated annotated dataset, data generated by a domain randomization scheme, and data sampled from a flow matching-based generative model. Extensive evaluations show that vesselFM outperforms state-of-the-art medical image segmentation foundation models across four (pre-)clinically relevant imaging modalities in zero-, one-, and few-shot scenarios, therefore providing a universal solution for 3D blood vessel segmentation.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in foundation models have led to task-agnostic Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) and Large Language Model-based Time Series Models (TSLLMs), enabling generalized learning and integrating contextual information. However, their success depends on large, diverse, and high-quality datasets, which are challenging to build due to regulatory, diversity, quality, and quantity constraints. Synthetic data emerge as a viable solution, addressing these challenges by offering scalable, unbiased, and high-quality alternatives. This survey provides a comprehensive review of synthetic data for TSFMs and TSLLMs, analyzing data generation strategies, their role in model pretraining, fine-tuning, and evaluation, and identifying future research directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation Cures Personalization: Improving Personalized Models' Prompt Consistency via Hidden Foundation Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15277v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial personalization faces challenges to maintain identity fidelity without disrupting the foundation model's prompt consistency. The mainstream personalization models employ identity embedding to integrate identity information within the cross-attention mechanisms of UNet. However, our preliminary experimental findings reveal that identity embeddings compromise the effectiveness of other tokens in the prompt, thereby limiting high prompt consistency and controllability. Moreover, by deactivating identity embedding, personalization models still demonstrate the underlying foundation models' ability to control facial attributes precisely. It suggests that such foundation models' knowledge can be leveraged to \textbf{cure} the ill-aligned prompt consistency of personalization models. Building upon these insights, we propose \textbf{FreeCure}, a framework that improves the prompt consistency of personalization models with their latent foundation models' knowledge. First, by setting a dual inference paradigm with/without identity embedding, we identify attributes (\textit{e.g.}, hair, accessories, etc.) for enhancements. Second, we introduce a novel foundation-aware self-attention module, coupled with an inversion-based process to bring well-aligned attribute information to the personalization process. Our approach is \textbf{training-free}, and can effectively enhance a wide array of facial attributes in a non-intrusive manner; and it can be seamlessly integrated into existing popular personalization models, without harming their well-trained modules. FreeCure has demonstrated significant improvements in prompt consistency across a diverse set of state-of-the-art facial personalization models while maintaining the integrity of original identity fidelity.

Falcon offers a unified, prompt-based paradigm that effectively executes comprehensive and complex remote sensing tasks. Falcon demonstrates powerful understanding and reasoning abilities at the image, region, and pixel levels. Specifically, given simple natural language instructions and remote sensing images, Falcon can produce impressive results in text form across 14 distinct tasks, i.e., image classification, object detection, segmentation, image captioning, and etc. To facilitate Falcon's training and empower its representation capacity to encode rich spatial and semantic information, we developed Falcon_SFT, a large-scale, multi-task, instruction-tuning dataset in the field of remote sensing. The Falcon_SFT dataset consists of approximately 78 million high-quality data samples, covering 5.6 million multi-spatial resolution and multi-view remote sensing images with diverse instructions. It features hierarchical annotations and undergoes manual sampling verification to ensure high data quality and reliability. Extensive comparative experiments are conducted, which verify that Falcon achieves remarkable performance over 67 datasets and 14 tasks, despite having only 0.7B parameters. We release the complete dataset, code, and model weights at https://github.com/TianHuiLab/Falcon, hoping to help further develop the open-source community.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Towards Privacy-preserved Pre-training of Remote Sensing Foundation Models with Federated Mutual-guidance Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11051v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional Remote Sensing Foundation models (RSFMs) are pre-trained with a data-centralized paradigm, through self-supervision on large-scale curated remote sensing data. For each institution, however, pre-training RSFMs with limited data in a standalone manner may lead to suboptimal performance, while aggregating remote sensing data from multiple institutions for centralized pre-training raises privacy concerns. Seeking for collaboration is a promising solution to resolve this dilemma, where multiple institutions can collaboratively train RSFMs without sharing private data. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserved pre-training framework (FedSense), which enables multiple institutions to collaboratively train RSFMs without sharing private data. However, it is a non-trivial task hindered by a vicious cycle, which results from model drift by remote sensing data heterogeneity and high communication overhead. To break this vicious cycle, we introduce Federated Mutual-guidance Learning. Specifically, we propose a Server-to-Clients Guidance (SCG) mechanism to guide clients updates towards global-flatness optimal solutions. Additionally, we propose a Clients-to-Server Guidance (CSG) mechanism to inject local knowledge into the server by low-bit communication. Extensive experiments on four downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our FedSense in both full-precision and communication-reduced scenarios, showcasing remarkable communication efficiency and performance gains.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

While most prior work has constrained inputs to fixed sensors, a new class of any-sensor foundation models able to process arbitrary sensors has recently emerged. Contributing to this line of work, we propose Panopticon, an any-sensor foundation model built on the DINOv2 framework. We extend DINOv2 by (1) treating images of the same geolocation across sensors as natural augmentations, (2) subsampling channels to diversify spectral input, and (3) adding a cross attention over channels as a flexible patch embedding mechanism. By encoding the wavelength and modes of optical and synthetic aperture radar sensors, respectively, Panopticon can effectively process any combination of arbitrary channels. In extensive evaluations, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on GEO-Bench, especially on the widely-used Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 sensors, while out-competing other any-sensor models, as well as domain adapted fixed-sensor models on unique sensor configurations. Panopticon enables immediate generalization to both existing and future satellite platforms, advancing sensor-agnostic EO.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally.

LLM-Based Curation for a Data-Efficient Audio-Video Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09205v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating audio and visual data for training multimodal foundational models remains challenging. We present Audio-Video Vector Alignment (AVVA), which aligns audiovisual (AV) scene content beyond mere temporal synchronization via a Large Language Model (LLM)-based data curation pipeline. Specifically, AVVA scores and selects high-quality training clips using Whisper (speech-based audio foundation model) for audio and DINOv2 for video within a dual-encoder contrastive learning framework. Evaluations on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound demonstrate that this approach can achieve significant accuracy gains with substantially less curated data. For instance, AVVA yields a 7.6% improvement in top-1 accuracy for audio-to-video retrieval on VGGSound compared to ImageBind, despite training on only 192 hours of carefully filtered data (vs. 5800+ hours). Moreover, an ablation study highlights that trading data quantity for data quality improves performance, yielding respective top-3 accuracy increases of 47.8, 48.4, and 58.0 percentage points on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound over uncurated baselines. While these results underscore AVVA's data efficiency, we also discuss the overhead of LLM-driven curation and how it may be scaled or approximated in larger domains. Overall, AVVA provides a viable path toward more robust, text-free audiovisual learning with improved retrieval accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ar...</summary><p>We are withdrawing this version due to the need for substantial updates in scope and organization, which affect the clarity and completeness of the manuscript.

| **[Siamese Foundation Models for Crystal Structure Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10471v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP), which aims to generate stable crystal structures from compositions, represents a critical pathway for discovering novel materials. While structure prediction tasks in other domains, such as proteins, have seen remarkable progress, CSP remains a relatively underexplored area due to the more complex geometries inherent in crystal structures. In this paper, we propose Siamese foundation models specifically designed to address CSP. Our pretrain-finetune framework, named DAO, comprises two complementary foundation models: DAO-G for structure generation and DAO-P for energy prediction. Experiments on CSP benchmarks (MP-20 and MPTS-52) demonstrate that our DAO-G significantly surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across all metrics. Extensive ablation studies further confirm that DAO-G excels in generating diverse polymorphic structures, and the dataset relaxation and energy guidance provided by DAO-P are essential for enhancing DAO-G's performance. When applied to three real-world superconductors ($\text{CsV}_3\text{Sb}_5$, $ \text{Zr}_{16}\text{Rh}_8\text{O}_4$ and $\text{Zr}_{16}\text{Pd}_8\text{O}_4$) that are known to be challenging to analyze, our foundation models achieve accurate critical temperature predictions and structure generations. For instance, on $\text{CsV}_3\text{Sb}_5$, DAO-G generates a structure close to the experimental one with an RMSE of 0.0085; DAO-P predicts the $T_c$ value with high accuracy (2.26 K vs. the ground-truth value of 2.30 K). In contrast, conventional DFT calculators like Quantum Espresso only successfully derive the structure of the first superconductor within an acceptable time, while the RMSE is nearly 8 times larger, and the computation speed is more than 1000 times slower. These compelling results collectively highlight the potential of our approach for advancing materials science research and development.</p></details> |  |

We develop a framework - the "Society of HiveMind" (SOHM) - that orchestrates the interaction between multiple AI foundation models, imitating the observed behavior of animal swarms in nature by following modern evolutionary theories. On the one hand, we find that the SOHM provides a negligible benefit on tasks that mainly require real-world knowledge. On the other hand, we remark a significant improvement on tasks that require intensive logical reasoning, indicating that multi-agent systems are capable of increasing the reasoning capabilities of the collective compared to the individual agents. Our findings demonstrate the potential of combining a multitude of diverse AI foundation models to form an artificial swarm intelligence capable of self-improvement through interactions with a given environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages (excl. appendix)</p></details> |
| **[RoMA: Scaling up Mamba-based Foundation Models for Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10392v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in self-supervised learning for Vision Transformers (ViTs) have fueled breakthroughs in remote sensing (RS) foundation models. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention poses a significant barrier to scalability, particularly for large models and high-resolution images. While the linear-complexity Mamba architecture offers a promising alternative, existing RS applications of Mamba remain limited to supervised tasks on small, domain-specific datasets. To address these challenges, we propose RoMA, a framework that enables scalable self-supervised pretraining of Mamba-based RS foundation models using large-scale, diverse, unlabeled data. RoMA enhances scalability for high-resolution images through a tailored auto-regressive learning strategy, incorporating two key innovations: 1) a rotation-aware pretraining mechanism combining adaptive cropping with angular embeddings to handle sparsely distributed objects with arbitrary orientations, and 2) multi-scale token prediction objectives that address the extreme variations in object scales inherent to RS imagery. Systematic empirical studies validate that Mamba adheres to RS data and parameter scaling laws, with performance scaling reliably as model and data size increase. Furthermore, experiments across scene classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that RoMA-pretrained Mamba models consistently outperform ViT-based counterparts in both accuracy and computational efficiency. The source code and pretrained models will be released at https://github.com/MiliLab/RoMA.</p></details> |  |

This makes it impossible to introduce implementation and optimization techniques that are provably correct and, in fact, has led to discrepancies between different implementations. Moreover, it precludes studying fundamental properties of different languages (e.g., expressive power). To address this gap, this paper introduces a language-agnostic algebra for capturing mapping definitions. As further contributions, we show that the popular mapping language RML can be translated into our algebra (by which we also provide a formal definition of the semantics of RML) and we prove several algebraic rewriting rules that can be used to optimize mapping plans based on our algebra.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended version of a research paper accepted for the 22nd Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC 2025).

A large step for the community are open Vision Language Action models which showcase strong performance in a wide variety of tasks. In this work, we study the visual generalization capabilities of three existing robotic foundation models, and propose a corresponding evaluation framework. Our study shows that the existing models do not exhibit robustness to visual out-of-domain scenarios. This is potentially caused by limited variations in the training data and/or catastrophic forgetting, leading to domain limitations in the vision foundation models. We further explore OpenVLA, which uses two pre-trained vision foundation models and is, therefore, expected to generalize to out-of-domain experiments. However, we showcase catastrophic forgetting by DINO-v2 in OpenVLA through its failure to fulfill the task of depth regression. To overcome the aforementioned issue of visual catastrophic forgetting, we propose a gradual backbone reversal approach founded on model merging. This enables OpenVLA which requires the adaptation of the visual backbones during initial training -- to regain its visual generalization ability. Regaining this capability enables our ReVLA model to improve over OpenVLA by a factor of 77% and 66% for grasping and lifting in visual OOD tasks .</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICRA-2025, Atlanta</p></details> |

Despite significant efforts to build real-world simulators, the application of generative models to virtual worlds, like financial markets, remains under-explored. In financial markets, generative models can simulate complex market effects of participants with various behaviors, enabling interaction under different market conditions, and training strategies without financial risk. This simulation relies on the finest structured data in financial market like orders thus building the finest realistic simulation. We propose Large Market Model (LMM), an order-level generative foundation model, for financial market simulation, akin to language modeling in the digital world. Our financial Market Simulation engine (MarS), powered by LMM, addresses the domain-specific need for realistic, interactive and controllable order generation. Key observations include LMM's strong scalability across data size and model complexity, and MarS's robust and practicable realism in controlled generation with market impact. We showcase MarS as a forecast tool, detection system, analysis platform, and agent training environment, thus demonstrating MarS's "paradigm shift" potential for a variety of financial applications.

A Holistic Embodied Cognition Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05031v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The enhancement of generalization in robots by large vision-language models (LVLMs) is increasingly evident. Therefore, the embodied cognitive abilities of LVLMs based on egocentric videos are of great interest. However, current datasets for embodied video question answering lack comprehensive and systematic evaluation frameworks. Critical embodied cognitive issues, such as robotic self-cognition, dynamic scene perception, and hallucination, are rarely addressed. To tackle these challenges, we propose ECBench, a high-quality benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the embodied cognitive abilities of LVLMs. ECBench features a diverse range of scene video sources, open and varied question formats, and 30 dimensions of embodied cognition. To ensure quality, balance, and high visual dependence, ECBench uses class-independent meticulous human annotation and multi-round question screening strategies. Additionally, we introduce ECEval, a comprehensive evaluation system that ensures the fairness and rationality of the indicators. Utilizing ECBench, we conduct extensive evaluations of proprietary, open-source, and task-specific LVLMs. ECBench is pivotal in advancing the embodied cognitive capabilities of LVLMs, laying a solid foundation for developing reliable core models for embodied agents.

Traditional single-modality approaches often fail to leverage the complementary insights provided by radiological and pathological assessments. In this work, we introduce M4Survive (Multi-Modal Mamba Modeling for Survival Prediction), a novel framework that learns joint foundation model representations using efficient adapter networks. Our approach dynamically fuses heterogeneous embeddings from a foundation model repository (e.g., MedImageInsight, BiomedCLIP, Prov-GigaPath, UNI2-h), creating a correlated latent space optimized for survival risk estimation. By leveraging Mamba-based adapters, M4Survive enables efficient multi-modal learning while preserving computational efficiency. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms both unimodal and traditional static multi-modal baselines in survival prediction accuracy. This work underscores the potential of foundation model-driven multi-modal fusion in advancing precision oncology and predictive analytics.</p></details> | 10 pages |

The advancement of deep learning has facilitated the creation of numerous medical datasets with diverse expert-level annotations. Aggregating these datasets can maximize data utilization and address the inadequacy of labeled data. However, the heterogeneity of expert-level annotations across tasks such as classification, localization, and segmentation presents a significant challenge for learning from these datasets. To this end, we introduce nFoundation X, an end-to-end framework that utilizes diverse expert-level annotations from numerous public datasets to train a foundation model capable of multiple tasks including classification, localization, and segmentation. To address the challenges of annotation and task heterogeneity, we propose a Lock-Release pretraining strategy to enhance the cyclic learning from multiple datasets, combined with the student-teacher learning paradigm, ensuring the model retains general knowledge for all tasks while preventing overfitting to any single task. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Foundation X, we trained a model using 11 chest X-ray datasets, covering annotations for classification, localization, and segmentation tasks. Our experimental results show that Foundation X achieves notable performance gains through extensive annotation utilization, excels in cross-dataset and cross-task learning, and further enhances performance in organ localization and segmentation tasks.

As vision foundation models (VFMs) increasingly serve as the backbone of vision applications, it remains unclear how SSL interacts with these pre-trained models. To address this gap, we develop new SSL benchmark datasets where frozen VFMs underperform and systematically evaluate representative SSL methods. We make a surprising observation: parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using only labeled data often matches SSL performance, even without leveraging unlabeled data. This motivates us to revisit self-training, a conceptually simple SSL baseline, where we use the supervised PEFT model to pseudo-label unlabeled data for further training. To overcome the notorious issue of noisy pseudo-labels, we propose ensembling multiple PEFT approaches and VFM backbones to produce more robust pseudo-labels. Empirical results validate the effectiveness of this simple yet powerful approach, providing actionable insights into SSL with VFMs and paving the way for more scalable and practical semi-supervised learning in the era of foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parameter-Efficient Adaptation of Geospatial Foundation Models through Embedding Deflection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09493v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large-scale heterogeneous data sets become increasingly available, adapting foundation models at low cost has become a key issue. Seminal works in natural language processing, e.g. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), leverage the low "intrinsic rank" of parameter updates during adaptation. In this paper, we argue that incorporating stronger inductive biases in both data and models can enhance the adaptation of Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs), pretrained on RGB satellite images, to other types of optical satellite data. Specifically, the pretrained parameters of GFMs serve as a strong prior for the spatial structure of multispectral images. For this reason, we introduce DEFLECT (Deflecting Embeddings for Finetuning Latent representations for Earth and Climate Tasks), a novel strategy for adapting GFMs to multispectral satellite imagery with very few additional parameters. DEFLECT improves the representation capabilities of the extracted features, particularly enhancing spectral information, which is essential for geoscience and environmental-related tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across three different GFMs and five diverse datasets, ranging from forest monitoring to marine environment segmentation. Compared to competing methods, DEFLECT achieves on-par or higher accuracy with 5-10$\times$ fewer parameters for classification and segmentation tasks. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

For this reason, they are susceptible to the memorization and subsequent reproduction of training samples. In this paper, we introduce a training-as-compressing perspective, wherein the model's weights embody a compressed representation of the training data. From a copyright standpoint, this point of view implies that the weights can be considered a reproduction or, more likely, a derivative work of a potentially protected set of works. We investigate the technical and legal challenges that emerge from this framing of the copyright of outputs generated by foundation models, including their implications for practitioners and researchers. We demonstrate that adopting an information-centric approach to the problem presents a promising pathway for tackling these emerging complex legal issues.</p></details> | <details><summary>Spotl...</summary><p>Spotlight presentation at GenLaw'24, see https://www.genlaw.org/2024-icml-papers#training-foundation-models-as-data-compression-on-information-model-weights-and-copyright-law</p></details> |
| **[Towards Graph Foundation Models: A Transferability Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09363v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) have gained significant attention for their potential to generalize across diverse graph domains and tasks. Some works focus on Domain-Specific GFMs, which are designed to address a variety of tasks within a specific domain, while others aim to create General-Purpose GFMs that extend the capabilities of domain-specific models to multiple domains. Regardless of the type, transferability is crucial for applying GFMs across different domains and tasks. However, achieving strong transferability is a major challenge due to the structural, feature, and distributional variations in graph data. To date, there has been no systematic research examining and analyzing GFMs from the perspective of transferability. To bridge the gap, we present the first comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes and analyzes existing GFMs through the lens of transferability, structuring GFMs around their application scope (domain-specific vs. general-purpose) and their approaches to knowledge acquisition and transfer. We provide a structured perspective on current progress and identify potential pathways for advancing GFM generalization across diverse graph datasets and tasks. We aims to shed light on the current landscape of GFMs and inspire future research directions in GFM development.</p></details> |  |

Traditional deep learning approaches have significantly advanced this field, particularly in the stage of ST data mining. However, these models remain task-specific and often require extensive labeled data. Inspired by the success of Foundation Models (FM), especially large language models, researchers have begun exploring the concept of Spatio-Temporal Foundation Models (STFMs) to enhance adaptability and generalization across diverse ST tasks. Unlike prior architectures, STFMs empower the entire workflow of ST data science, ranging from data sensing, management, to mining, thereby offering a more holistic and scalable approach. Despite rapid progress, a systematic study of STFMs for ST data science remains lacking. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive review of STFMs, categorizing existing methodologies and identifying key research directions to advance ST general intelligence.</p></details> |  |

Recently, publicly available material data repositories have grown rapidly. This growth encompasses not only more materials but also a greater variety and quantity of their associated properties. Existing machine learning efforts in materials science focus primarily on single-modality tasks, i.e. relationships between materials and a single physical property, thus not taking advantage of the rich and multimodal set of material properties. Here, we introduce Multimodal Learning for Materials (MultiMat), which enables self-supervised multi-modality training of foundation models for materials. We demonstrate our framework's potential using data from the Materials Project database on multiple axes: (i) MultiMat achieves state-of-the-art performance for challenging material property prediction tasks; (ii) MultiMat enables novel and accurate material discovery via latent space similarity, enabling screening for stable materials with desired properties; and (iii) MultiMat encodes interpretable emergent features that may provide novel scientific insights.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

While early developments centered on uni-modal models trained solely on visual data, recent advances have highlighted the promise of multi-modal foundation models that integrate heterogeneous data sources such as textual reports, structured domain knowledge, and molecular profiles. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and up-to-date review of multi-modal foundation models in CPath, with a particular focus on models built upon hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole slide images (WSIs) and tile-level representations. We categorize 32 state-of-the-art multi-modal foundation models into three major paradigms: vision-language, vision-knowledge graph, and vision-gene expression. We further divide vision-language models into non-LLM-based and LLM-based approaches. Additionally, we analyze 28 available multi-modal datasets tailored for pathology, grouped into image-text pairs, instruction datasets, and image-other modality pairs. Our survey also presents a taxonomy of downstream tasks, highlights training and evaluation strategies, and identifies key challenges and future directions. We aim for this survey to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of pathology and AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[ByteCheckpoint: A Unified Checkpointing System for Large Foundation Model Development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20143v3)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Checkpointing to preserve training states is crucial during the development of Large Foundation Models (LFMs), for training resumption upon various failures or changes in GPU resources and parallelism configurations. In addition, saved checkpoints are dispatched to evaluation tasks or transferred across different training stages (e.g., from pre-training to post-training). All these scenarios require resharding distributed checkpoints from one parallelism to another. In production environments, different LFMs are trained with various frameworks and storage backends, depending on model sizes and training scales. A high-performance checkpointing system is needed to enable efficient checkpoint management at scale throughout the lifecycle of LFM development. We introduce ByteCheckpoint, an industrial-grade checkpointing system for large-scale LFM training. ByteCheckpoint features: a parallelism-agnostic checkpoint representation that enables efficient load-time checkpoint resharding; a generic checkpoint saving/loading workflow to accommodate multiple training frameworks and support different storage backends; full-stack optimizations to ensure high I/O efficiency and scalability; a suite of monitoring tools to streamline large-scale performance analysis and bottleneck detection. Compared to existing open-source checkpointing systems [52, 58], ByteCheckpoint significantly reduces runtime checkpoint stalls, achieving an average reduction of 54.20x. For saving and loading times, ByteCheckpoint achieves improvements of up to 9.96x and 8.80x, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing robot foundation models rely solely on 2D image observations, ignoring 3D geometric information, which is essential for robots to perceive and reason about the 3D world. In this paper, we introduce FP3, a first large-scale 3D foundation policy model for robotic manipulation. FP3 builds on a scalable diffusion transformer architecture and is pre-trained on 60k trajectories with point cloud observations. With the model design and diverse pre-training data, FP3 can be efficiently fine-tuned for downstream tasks while exhibiting strong generalization capabilities. Experiments on real robots demonstrate that with only 80 demonstrations, FP3 is able to learn a new task with over 90% success rates in novel environments with unseen objects, significantly surpassing existing robot foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://3d-foundation-policy.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Do computer vision foundation models learn the low-level characteristics of the human visual system?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20256v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer vision foundation models, such as DINO or OpenCLIP, are trained in a self-supervised manner on large image datasets. Analogously, substantial evidence suggests that the human visual system (HVS) is influenced by the statistical distribution of colors and patterns in the natural world, characteristics also present in the training data of foundation models. The question we address in this paper is whether foundation models trained on natural images mimic some of the low-level characteristics of the human visual system, such as contrast detection, contrast masking, and contrast constancy. Specifically, we designed a protocol comprising nine test types to evaluate the image encoders of 45 foundation and generative models. Our results indicate that some foundation models (e.g., DINO, DINOv2, and OpenCLIP), share some of the characteristics of human vision, but other models show little resemblance. Foundation models tend to show smaller sensitivity to low contrast and rather irregular responses to contrast across frequencies. The foundation models show the best agreement with human data in terms of contrast masking. Our findings suggest that human vision and computer vision may take both similar and different paths when learning to interpret images of the real world. Overall, while differences remain, foundation models trained on vision tasks start to align with low-level human vision, with DINOv2 showing the closest resemblance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Specifically, YuE scales to trillions of tokens and generates up to five minutes of music while maintaining lyrical alignment, coherent musical structure, and engaging vocal melodies with appropriate accompaniment. It achieves this through (1) track-decoupled next-token prediction to overcome dense mixture signals, (2) structural progressive conditioning for long-context lyrical alignment, and (3) a multitask, multiphase pre-training recipe to converge and generalize. In addition, we redesign the in-context learning technique for music generation, enabling versatile style transfer (e.g., converting Japanese city pop into an English rap while preserving the original accompaniment) and bidirectional generation. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that YuE matches or even surpasses some of the proprietary systems in musicality and vocal agility. In addition, fine-tuning YuE enables additional controls and enhanced support for tail languages. Furthermore, beyond generation, we show that YuE's learned representations can perform well on music understanding tasks, where the results of YuE match or exceed state-of-the-art methods on the MARBLE benchmark.

In this work, we show that advances in generative modeling, photorealistic rendering, and procedural generation allow us to tackle tasks requiring both. By generating contact-rich trajectories with accurate physics in semantically-diverse simulations, we can distill behaviors into large multimodal models that directly transfer to the real world: a system we call Proc4Gem. Specifically, we show that a foundation model, Gemini, fine-tuned on only simulation data, can be instructed in language to control a quadruped robot to push an object with its body to unseen targets in unseen real-world environments. Our real-world results demonstrate the promise of using simulation to imbue foundation models with physical agency.

The coding sequence as well as the Untranslated Regions (UTRs) of an mRNA can strongly influence translation efficiency, stability, degradation, and other factors that collectively determine a vaccine's effectiveness. However, optimizing mRNA sequences for those properties remains a complex challenge. Existing deep learning models often focus solely on coding region optimization, overlooking the UTRs. We present Helix-mRNA, a structured state-space-based and attention hybrid model to address these challenges. In addition to a first pre-training, a second pre-training stage allows us to specialise the model with high-quality data. We employ single nucleotide tokenization of mRNA sequences with codon separation, ensuring prior biological and structural information from the original mRNA sequence is not lost. Our model, Helix-mRNA, outperforms existing methods in analysing both UTRs and coding region properties. It can process sequences 6x longer than current approaches while using only 10% of the parameters of existing foundation models. Its predictive capabilities extend to all mRNA regions. We open-source the model (https://github.com/helicalAI/helical) and model weights (https://huggingface.co/helical-ai/helix-mRNA).</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Are foundation models for computer vision good conformal predictors?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06082v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in self-supervision and contrastive learning have brought the performance of foundation models to unprecedented levels in a variety of tasks. Fueled by this progress, these models are becoming the prevailing approach for a wide array of real-world vision problems, including risk-sensitive and high-stakes applications. However, ensuring safe deployment in these scenarios requires a more comprehensive understanding of their uncertainty modeling capabilities, which has been barely explored. In this work, we delve into the behaviour of vision and vision-language foundation models under Conformal Prediction (CP), a statistical framework that provides theoretical guarantees of marginal coverage of the true class. Across extensive experiments including popular vision classification benchmarks, well-known foundation vision models, and three CP methods, our findings reveal that foundation models are well-suited for conformalization procedures, particularly those integrating Vision Transformers. We also show that calibrating the confidence predictions of these models, a popular strategy to improve their uncertainty quantification, actually leads to efficiency degradation of the conformal set on adaptive CP methods. Furthermore, few-shot adaptation of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to downstream tasks, whose popularity is surging, enhances conformal scores compared to zero-shot predictions. Last, our empirical study exposes APS as particularly promising in the context of vision foundation models, as it does not violate the marginal coverage guarantees across multiple challenging, yet realistic scenarios.</p></details> |  |

The deformability of garments leads to a vast state space and complex dynamics, which complicates precise and fine-grained manipulation. Previous approaches often rely on predefined key points or demonstrations, limiting their generalization across diverse garment categories. This paper presents a framework, MetaFold, that disentangles task planning from action prediction, learning each independently to enhance model generalization. It employs language-guided point cloud trajectory generation for task planning and a low-level foundation model for action prediction. This structure facilitates multi-category learning, enabling the model to adapt flexibly to various user instructions and folding tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework. Supplementary materials are available on our website: https://meta-fold.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

Adapting the standard GPT architecture to suit the continuous characteristics of PPG signals, our approach demonstrates promising results. Our models are pre-trained on our extensive dataset that contains more than 200 million 30s PPG samples. We explored different supervised fine-tuning techniques to adapt our model to downstream tasks, resulting in performance comparable to or surpassing current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in tasks like atrial fibrillation detection. A standout feature of our GPT model is its inherent capability to perform generative tasks such as signal denoising effectively, without the need for further fine-tuning. This success is attributed to the generative nature of the GPT framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Generative Geospatial Diffusion Models Excel as Discriminative Geospatial Foundation Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07890v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has revolutionized representation learning in Remote Sensing (RS), advancing Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs) to leverage vast unlabeled satellite imagery for diverse downstream tasks. Currently, GFMs primarily focus on discriminative objectives, such as contrastive learning or masked image modeling, owing to their proven success in learning transferable representations. However, generative diffusion models--which demonstrate the potential to capture multi-grained semantics essential for RS tasks during image generation--remain underexplored for discriminative applications. This prompts the question: can generative diffusion models also excel and serve as GFMs with sufficient discriminative power? In this work, we answer this question with SatDiFuser, a framework that transforms a diffusion-based generative geospatial foundation model into a powerful pretraining tool for discriminative RS. By systematically analyzing multi-stage, noise-dependent diffusion features, we develop three fusion strategies to effectively leverage these diverse representations. Extensive experiments on remote sensing benchmarks show that SatDiFuser outperforms state-of-the-art GFMs, achieving gains of up to +5.7% mIoU in semantic segmentation and +7.9% F1-score in classification, demonstrating the capacity of diffusion-based generative foundation models to rival or exceed discriminative GFMs. Code will be released.</p></details> |  |

Our approach derives two distinct lower bounds: i) for the downstream task space, such as classification, optimised using conditional and marginal cross-entropy alongside Kullback-Leibler divergence, and ii) for the latent space representation, regularised and aligned using a contrastive-like decomposition. This fine-tuning strategy retains the pre-trained structure of the foundation model, modifying only a specialised projector module comprising a small transformer and a token aggregation technique. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate significant improvements in classification tasks under extremely low-labelled conditions by effectively leveraging unlabelled data.</p></details> |  |

However, prevalent models such as Flux, SD3.5 and Midjourney, still grapple with issues like model bias, limited text rendering capabilities, and insufficient understanding of Chinese cultural nuances. To address these limitations, we present Seedream 2.0, a native Chinese-English bilingual image generation foundation model that excels across diverse dimensions, which adeptly manages text prompt in both Chinese and English, supporting bilingual image generation and text rendering. We develop a powerful data system that facilitates knowledge integration, and a caption system that balances the accuracy and richness for image description. Particularly, Seedream is integrated with a self-developed bilingual large language model as a text encoder, allowing it to learn native knowledge directly from massive data. This enable it to generate high-fidelity images with accurate cultural nuances and aesthetic expressions described in either Chinese or English. Beside, Glyph-Aligned ByT5 is applied for flexible character-level text rendering, while a Scaled ROPE generalizes well to untrained resolutions. Multi-phase post-training optimizations, including SFT and RLHF iterations, further improve the overall capability. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that Seedream 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple aspects, including prompt-following, aesthetics, text rendering, and structural correctness. Furthermore, Seedream 2.0 has been optimized through multiple RLHF iterations to closely align its output with human preferences, as revealed by its outstanding ELO score. In addition, it can be readily adapted to an instruction-based image editing model, such as SeedEdit, with strong editing capability that balances instruction-following and image consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Offic...</summary><p>Official Page: https://team.doubao.com/tech/seedream</p></details> |

Intelligence is understood as the ability to create novel skills that allow to achieve goals under previously unknown conditions. To this end, intelligence utilises reasoning methods such as deduction, induction and abduction as well as other methods such as abstraction and classification to develop a world model. The methods are applied to indirect and incomplete representations of the world, which are obtained through perception, for example, and which do not depict the world but only correspond to it. Due to these limitations and the uncertain and contingent nature of reasoning, the world model is constructivist. Its value is functionally determined by its viability, i.e., its potential to achieve the desired goals. In consequence, meaning is assigned to representations by attributing them a function that makes it possible to achieve a goal. This representational and functional conception of intelligence enables a naturalistic interpretation that does not presuppose mental features, such as intentionality and consciousness, which are regarded as independent of intelligence. Based on a phenomenological analysis, it is shown that AGI can gain a more fundamental access to the world than humans, although it is limited by the No Free Lunch theorems, which require assumptions to be made.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, the field of graph machine learning is witnessing a paradigm transition from shallow methods to more sophisticated deep learning approaches. The capabilities of foundation models in generalization and adaptation motivate graph machine learning researchers to discuss the potential of developing a new graph learning paradigm. This paradigm envisions models that are pre-trained on extensive graph data and can be adapted for various graph tasks. Despite this burgeoning interest, there is a noticeable lack of clear definitions and systematic analyses pertaining to this new domain. To this end, this article introduces the concept of Graph Foundation Models (GFMs), and offers an exhaustive explanation of their key characteristics and underlying technologies. We proceed to classify the existing work related to GFMs into three distinct categories, based on their dependence on graph neural networks and large language models.

While current research focuses primarily on the policies' generalization capabilities across a variety of tasks, it fails to address safety, a critical requirement for deployment on real-world systems. In this paper, we introduce a safety layer designed to constrain the action space of any generalist policy appropriately. Our approach uses ATACOM, a safe reinforcement learning algorithm that creates a safe action space and, therefore, ensures safe state transitions. By extending ATACOM to generalist policies, our method facilitates their deployment in safety-critical scenarios without requiring any specific safety fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this safety layer in an air hockey environment, where it prevents a puck-hitting agent from colliding with its surroundings, a failure observed in generalist policies.</p></details> |  |

However, they struggle to segment objects with certain structures, particularly those with dense, tree-like morphology and low textural contrast from their surroundings. These failure modes are crucial for understanding the limitations of SFMs in real-world applications. To systematically study this issue, we introduce interpretable metrics quantifying object tree-likeness and textural separability. On carefully controlled synthetic experiments and real-world datasets, we show that SFM performance (e.g., SAM, SAM 2, HQ-SAM) noticeably correlates with these factors. We link these failures to "textural confusion", where models misinterpret local structure as global texture, causing over-segmentation or difficulty distinguishing objects from similar backgrounds. Notably, targeted fine-tuning fails to resolve this issue, indicating a fundamental limitation. Our study provides the first quantitative framework for modeling the behavior of SFMs on challenging structures, offering interpretable insights into their segmentation capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/mazurowski-lab/SAM-TexturalConfusion-Metrics</p></details> |

To simplify label acquisition, this work proposes a novel approach that bridges 2D vision foundation models (VFMs) with 3D tasks by decoupling 3D supervision into an ensemble of image-level primitives, e.g., semantic and geometric components. As a key motivator, we leverage the zero-shot capabilities of vision-language models for image semantics. However, due to the notorious ill-posed problem - multiple distinct 3D scenes can produce identical 2D projections, directly inferring metric depth from a monocular image in a zero-shot manner is unsuitable. In contrast, 2D VFMs provide promising sources of relative depth, which theoretically aligns with metric depth when properly scaled and offset. Thus, we adapt the relative depth derived from VFMs into metric depth by optimising the scale and offset using temporal consistency, also known as novel view synthesis, without access to ground-truth metric depth. Consequently, we project the semantics into 3D space using the reconstructed metric depth, thereby providing 3D supervision. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. For instance, the proposed method surpasses the current state-of-the-art by 3.34% mIoU on nuScenes for voxel occupancy prediction.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Task-Specific Knowledge Distillation from the Vision Foundation Model for Enhanced Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06976v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale pre-trained models, such as Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), have demonstrated impressive performance across various downstream tasks by transferring generalized knowledge, especially when target data is limited. However, their high computational cost and the domain gap between natural and medical images limit their practical application in medical segmentation tasks. Motivated by this, we pose the following important question: "How can we effectively utilize the knowledge of large pre-trained VFMs to train a small, task-specific model for medical image segmentation when training data is limited?" To address this problem, we propose a novel and generalizable task-specific knowledge distillation framework. Our method fine-tunes the VFM on the target segmentation task to capture task-specific features before distilling the knowledge to smaller models, leveraging Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to reduce the computational cost of fine-tuning. Additionally, we incorporate synthetic data generated by diffusion models to augment the transfer set, enhancing model performance in data-limited scenarios. Experimental results across five medical image datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms task-agnostic knowledge distillation and self-supervised pretraining approaches like MoCo v3 and Masked Autoencoders (MAE). For example, on the KidneyUS dataset, our method achieved a 28% higher Dice score than task-agnostic KD using 80 labeled samples for fine-tuning. On the CHAOS dataset, it achieved an 11% improvement over MAE with 100 labeled samples. These results underscore the potential of task-specific knowledge distillation to train accurate, efficient models for medical image segmentation in data-constrained settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 10 figures, 16 tables</p></details> |

Traditional methods, dependent on invasive tissue sampling, often fail to capture the spatial heterogeneity of the tumor. While deep learning has improved segmentation and molecular profiling, few approaches simultaneously integrate tumor morphology and molecular features. Foundation deep learning models, which learn robust, task-agnostic representations from large-scale datasets, hold great promise but remain underutilized in glioma imaging biomarkers. We propose the Multi-Task SWIN-UNETR (MTS-UNET) model, a novel foundation-based framework built on the BrainSegFounder model, pretrained on large-scale neuroimaging data. MTS-UNET simultaneously performs glioma segmentation, histological grading, and molecular subtyping (IDH mutation and 1p/19q co-deletion). It incorporates two key modules: Tumor-Aware Feature Encoding (TAFE) for multi-scale, tumor-focused feature extraction and Cross-Modality Differential (CMD) for highlighting subtle T2-FLAIR mismatch signals associated with IDH mutation. The model was trained and validated on a diverse, multi-center cohort of 2,249 glioma patients from seven public datasets. MTS-UNET achieved a mean Dice score of 84% for segmentation, along with AUCs of 90.58% for IDH mutation, 69.22% for 1p/19q co-deletion prediction, and 87.54% for grading, significantly outperforming baseline models (p<=0.05). Ablation studies validated the essential contributions of the TAFE and CMD modules and demonstrated the robustness of the framework. The foundation-based MTS-UNET model effectively integrates tumor segmentation with multi-level classification, exhibiting strong generalizability across diverse MRI datasets. This framework shows significant potential for advancing noninvasive, personalized glioma management by improving predictive accuracy and interpretability.</p></details> |  |

However, most studies do not address significant scientific applications. This paper aims to identify key features in time series by examining hydrology data. Our work advances computer science by emphasizing critical application features and contributes to hydrology and other scientific fields by identifying modeling approaches that effectively capture these features. Scientific time series data are inherently complex, involving observations from multiple locations, each with various time-dependent data streams and exogenous factors that may be static or time-varying and either application-dependent or purely mathematical. This research analyzes hydrology time series from the CAMELS and Caravan global datasets, which encompass rainfall and runoff data across catchments, featuring up to six observed streams and 209 static parameters across approximately 8,000 locations. Our investigation assesses the impact of exogenous data through eight different model configurations for key hydrology tasks. Results demonstrate that integrating exogenous information enhances data representation, reducing mean squared error by up to 40% in the largest dataset. Additionally, we present a detailed performance comparison of over 20 state-of-the-art pattern and foundation models. The analysis is fully open-source, facilitated by Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab for LSTM-based modeling, data preprocessing, and model comparisons. Preliminary findings using alternative deep learning architectures reveal that models incorporating comprehensive observed and exogenous data outperform more limited approaches, including foundation models. Notably, natural annual periodic exogenous time series contribute the most significant improvements, though static and other periodic factors are also valuable.</p></details> |  |
| **[PathVQ: Reforming Computational Pathology Foundation Model for Whole Slide Image Analysis via Vector Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06482v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational pathology and whole-slide image (WSI) analysis are pivotal in cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, the ultra-high resolution of WSIs presents significant modeling challenges. Recent advancements in pathology foundation models have improved performance, yet most approaches rely on [CLS] token representation of tile ViT as slide-level inputs (16x16 pixels is refereed as patch and 224x224 pixels as tile). This discards critical spatial details from patch tokens, limiting downstream WSI analysis tasks. We find that leveraging all spatial patch tokens benefits WSI analysis but incurs nearly 200x higher storage and training costs (e.g., 196 tokens in ViT$_{224}$). To address this, we introduce vector quantized (VQ) distillation on patch feature, which efficiently compresses spatial patch tokens using discrete indices and a decoder. Our method reduces token dimensionality from 1024 to 16, achieving a 64x compression rate while preserving reconstruction fidelity. Furthermore, we employ a multi-scale VQ (MSVQ) strategy, which not only enhances VQ reconstruction performance but also serves as a Self-supervised Learning (SSL) supervision for a seamless slide-level pretraining objective. Built upon the quantized patch features and supervision targets of tile via MSVQ, we develop a progressive convolutional module and slide-level SSL to extract representations with rich spatial-information for downstream WSI tasks. Extensive evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance in WSI analysis. Code will be available soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Foundations for Large Scale Multimodal Clinical Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07667v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in clinical AI have enabled remarkable progress across many clinical domains. However, existing benchmarks and models are primarily limited to a small set of modalities and tasks, which hinders the development of large-scale multimodal methods that can make holistic assessments of patient health and well-being. To bridge this gap, we introduce Clinical Large-Scale Integrative Multimodal Benchmark (CLIMB), a comprehensive clinical benchmark unifying diverse clinical data across imaging, language, temporal, and graph modalities. CLIMB comprises 4.51 million patient samples totaling 19.01 terabytes distributed across 2D imaging, 3D video, time series, graphs, and multimodal data. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that multitask pretraining significantly improves performance on understudied domains, achieving up to 29% improvement in ultrasound and 23% in ECG analysis over single-task learning. Pretraining on CLIMB also effectively improves models' generalization capability to new tasks, and strong unimodal encoder performance translates well to multimodal performance when paired with task-appropriate fusion strategies. Our findings provide a foundation for new architecture designs and pretraining strategies to advance clinical AI research. Code is released at https://github.com/DDVD233/climb.</p></details> |  |

We present GeoLangBind, a novel agglomerative vision--language foundation model that bridges the gap between heterogeneous EO data modalities using language as a unifying medium. Our approach aligns different EO data types into a shared language embedding space, enabling seamless integration and complementary feature learning from diverse sensor data. To achieve this, we construct a large-scale multimodal image--text dataset, GeoLangBind-2M, encompassing six data modalities. GeoLangBind leverages this dataset to develop a zero-shot foundation model capable of processing arbitrary numbers of EO data channels as input. Through our designed Modality-aware Knowledge Agglomeration (MaKA) module and progressive multimodal weight merging strategy, we create a powerful agglomerative foundation model that excels in both zero-shot vision--language comprehension and fine-grained visual understanding. Extensive evaluation across 23 datasets covering multiple tasks demonstrates GeoLangBind's superior performance and versatility in EO applications, offering a robust framework for various environmental monitoring and analysis tasks. The dataset and pretrained models will be publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>code ...</summary><p>code & weights: https://github.com/xiong-zhitong/GeoLB-SigLIP</p></details> |
| **[Universal Actions for Enhanced Embodied Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10105v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training on diverse, internet-scale data is a key factor in the success of recent large foundation models. Yet, using the same recipe for building embodied agents has faced noticeable difficulties. Despite the availability of many crowd-sourced embodied datasets, their action spaces often exhibit significant heterogeneity due to distinct physical embodiment and control interfaces for different robots, causing substantial challenges in developing embodied foundation models using cross-domain data. In this paper, we introduce UniAct, a new embodied foundation modeling framework operating in a Universal Action Space. Our learned universal actions capture the generic atomic behaviors across diverse robots by exploiting their shared structural features, and enable enhanced cross-domain data utilization and cross-embodiment generalizations by eliminating the notorious heterogeneity. The universal actions can be efficiently translated back to heterogeneous actionable commands by simply adding embodiment-specific details, from which fast adaptation to new robots becomes simple and straightforward. Our 0.5B instantiation of UniAct outperforms 14X larger SOTA embodied foundation models in extensive evaluations on various real-world and simulation robots, showcasing exceptional cross-embodiment control and adaptation capability, highlighting the crucial benefit of adopting universal actions.

However, due to the limited real-world data and unbearable consequences of taking detrimental actions, the learning of RL policy is mainly restricted within the simulators. This practice guarantees safety in learning but introduces an inevitable sim-to-real gap in terms of deployment, thus causing degraded performance and risks in execution. There are attempts to solve the sim-to-real problems from different domains with various techniques, especially in the era with emerging techniques such as large foundations or language models that have cast light on the sim-to-real. This survey paper, to the best of our knowledge, is the first taxonomy that formally frames the sim-to-real techniques from key elements of the Markov Decision Process (State, Action, Transition, and Reward). Based on the framework, we cover comprehensive literature from the classic to the most advanced methods including the sim-to-real techniques empowered by foundation models, and we also discuss the specialties that are worth attention in different domains of sim-to-real problems. Then we summarize the formal evaluation process of sim-to-real performance with accessible code or benchmarks. The challenges and opportunities are also presented to encourage future exploration of this direction. We are actively maintaining a repository to include the most up-to-date sim-to-real research work to help domain researchers.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[STAR: A Foundation Model-driven Framework for Robust Task Planning and Failure Recovery in Robotic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06060v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern robotic systems, deployed across domains from industrial automation to domestic assistance, face a critical challenge: executing tasks with precision and adaptability in dynamic, unpredictable environments. To address this, we propose STAR (Smart Task Adaptation and Recovery), a novel framework that synergizes Foundation Models (FMs) with dynamically expanding Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to enable resilient task planning and autonomous failure recovery. While FMs offer remarkable generalization and contextual reasoning, their limitations, including computational inefficiency, hallucinations, and output inconsistencies hinder reliable deployment. STAR mitigates these issues by embedding learned knowledge into structured, reusable KGs, which streamline information retrieval, reduce redundant FM computations, and provide precise, scenario-specific insights. The framework leverages FM-driven reasoning to diagnose failures, generate context-aware recovery strategies, and execute corrective actions without human intervention or system restarts. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on rigid protocols, STAR dynamically expands its KG with experiential knowledge, ensuring continuous adaptation to novel scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we developed a comprehensive dataset that includes various robotic tasks and failure scenarios. Through extensive experimentation, STAR demonstrated an 86% task planning accuracy and 78% recovery success rate, showing significant improvements over baseline methods. The framework's ability to continuously learn from experience while maintaining structured knowledge representation makes it particularly suitable for long-term deployment in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Ambiguity-Free Spatial Foundation Model: Rethinking and Decoupling Depth Ambiguity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06014v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Depth ambiguity is a fundamental challenge in spatial scene understanding, especially in transparent scenes where single-depth estimates fail to capture full 3D structure. Existing models, limited to deterministic predictions, overlook real-world multi-layer depth. To address this, we introduce a paradigm shift from single-prediction to multi-hypothesis spatial foundation models. We first present \texttt{MD-3k}, a benchmark exposing depth biases in expert and foundational models through multi-layer spatial relationship labels and new metrics. To resolve depth ambiguity, we propose Laplacian Visual Prompting (LVP), a training-free spectral prompting technique that extracts hidden depth from pre-trained models via Laplacian-transformed RGB inputs. By integrating LVP-inferred depth with standard RGB-based estimates, our approach elicits multi-layer depth without model retraining. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of LVP in zero-shot multi-layer depth estimation, unlocking more robust and comprehensive geometry-conditioned visual generation, 3D-grounded spatial reasoning, and temporally consistent video-level depth inference. Our benchmark and code will be available at https://github.com/Xiaohao-Xu/Ambiguity-in-Space.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 31 figures, github repo: https://github.com/Xiaohao-Xu/Ambiguity-in-Space</p></details> |
| **[A Mixture of Exemplars Approach for Efficient Out-of-Distribution Detection with Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17093v5)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the early weaknesses identified in deep neural networks trained for image classification tasks was their inability to provide low confidence predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) data that was significantly different from the in-distribution (ID) data used to train them. Representation learning, where neural networks are trained in specific ways that improve their ability to detect OOD examples, has emerged as a promising solution. However, these approaches require long training times and can add additional overhead to detect OOD examples. Recent developments in Vision Transformer (ViT) foundation models$\unicode{x2013}$large networks trained on large and diverse datasets with self-supervised approaches$\unicode{x2013}$also show strong performance in OOD detection, and could address these challenges. This paper presents Mixture of Exemplars (MoLAR), an efficient approach to tackling OOD detection challenges that is designed to maximise the benefit of training a classifier with a high quality, frozen, pretrained foundation model backbone. MoLAR provides strong OOD performance when only comparing the similarity of OOD examples to the exemplars, a small set of images chosen to be representative of the dataset, leading to up to 30 times faster OOD detection inference over other methods that provide best performance when the full ID dataset is used. In some cases, only using these exemplars actually improves performance with MoLAR. Extensive experiments demonstrate the improved OOD detection performance of MoLAR in comparison to comparable approaches in both supervised and semi-supervised settings, and code is available at github.com/emannix/molar-mixture-of-exemplars.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preserving Angles Improves Feature Distillation of Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15239v2)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge distillation approaches compress models by training a student network using the classification outputs of a high quality teacher model, but can fail to effectively transfer the properties of computer vision foundation models from the teacher to the student. While it has been recently shown that feature distillation$\unicode{x2013}$where a teacher model's output features are replicated instead$\unicode{x2013}$can reproduce performance for foundation models across numerous downstream tasks, they fall short in matching critical properties such as robustness and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection performance. This paper overcomes this shortcoming by introducing Cosine-similarity Preserving Compression (CosPress), a feature distillation technique that learns a mapping to compress the latent space of the teacher model into the smaller latent space of the student, by preserving the cosine similarities between image embeddings. This enables direct optimisation of the student network and produces a more faithful reproduction of the teacher's properties. It is shown that distillation with CosPress on a variety of datasets, including ImageNet, produces more accurate models with greater performance on generalisability, robustness and OOD detection benchmarks, and that this technique provides a competitive pathway for training highly performant lightweight models on small datasets.

| **[The Unified Control Framework: Establishing a Common Foundation for Enterprise AI Governance, Risk Management and Regulatory Compliance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05937v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of AI systems presents enterprises with a dual challenge: accelerating innovation while ensuring responsible governance. Current AI governance approaches suffer from fragmentation, with risk management frameworks that focus on isolated domains, regulations that vary across jurisdictions despite conceptual alignment, and high-level standards lacking concrete implementation guidance. This fragmentation increases governance costs and creates a false dichotomy between innovation and responsibility. We propose the Unified Control Framework (UCF): a comprehensive governance approach that integrates risk management and regulatory compliance through a unified set of controls. The UCF consists of three key components: (1) a comprehensive risk taxonomy synthesizing organizational and societal risks, (2) structured policy requirements derived from regulations, and (3) a parsimonious set of 42 controls that simultaneously address multiple risk scenarios and compliance requirements. We validate the UCF by mapping it to the Colorado AI Act, demonstrating how our approach enables efficient, adaptable governance that scales across regulations while providing concrete implementation guidance. The UCF reduces duplication of effort, ensures comprehensive coverage, and provides a foundation for automation, enabling organizations to achieve responsible AI governance without sacrificing innovation speed.</p></details> |  |

However, they face challenges such as low computational efficiency and limited interpretability, especially when dealing with large-scale remote sensing images. To overcome these, we draw inspiration from heat conduction, a physical process modeling local heat diffusion. Building on this idea, we are the first to explore the potential of using the parallel computing model of heat conduction to simulate the local region correlations in high-resolution remote sensing images, and introduce RS-vHeat, an efficient multi-modal remote sensing foundation model. Specifically, RS-vHeat 1) applies the Heat Conduction Operator (HCO) with a complexity of $O(N^{1.5})$ and a global receptive field, reducing computational overhead while capturing remote sensing object structure information to guide heat diffusion; 2) learns the frequency distribution representations of various scenes through a self-supervised strategy based on frequency domain hierarchical masking and multi-domain reconstruction; 3) significantly improves efficiency and performance over state-of-the-art techniques across 4 tasks and 10 datasets. Compared to attention-based remote sensing foundation models, we reduce memory usage by 84\%, FLOPs by 24\% and improves throughput by 2.7 times.

| **[ORANSight-2.0: Foundational LLMs for O-RAN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05200v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the transformative impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) across critical domains such as healthcare, customer service, and business marketing, their integration into Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) remains limited. This gap is primarily due to the absence of domain-specific foundational models, with existing solutions often relying on general-purpose LLMs that fail to address the unique challenges and technical intricacies of O-RAN. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORANSight-2.0 (O-RAN Insights), a pioneering initiative aimed at developing specialized foundational LLMs tailored for O-RAN. Built on 18 LLMs spanning five open-source LLM frameworks, ORANSight-2.0 fine-tunes models ranging from 1 to 70B parameters, significantly reducing reliance on proprietary, closed-source models while enhancing performance for O-RAN. At the core of ORANSight-2.0 is RANSTRUCT, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based instruction-tuning framework that employs two LLM agents to create high-quality instruction-tuning datasets. The generated dataset is then used to fine-tune the 18 pre-trained open-source LLMs via QLoRA. To evaluate ORANSight-2.0, we introduce srsRANBench, a novel benchmark designed for code generation and codebase understanding in the context of srsRAN, a widely used 5G O-RAN stack. We also leverage ORANBench13K, an existing benchmark for assessing O-RAN-specific knowledge. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that ORANSight-2.0 models outperform general-purpose and closed-source models, such as ChatGPT-4o and Gemini, by 5.421% on ORANBench and 18.465% on srsRANBench, achieving superior performance while maintaining lower computational and energy costs. We also experiment with RAG-augmented variants of ORANSight-2.0 LLMs and thoroughly evaluate their energy characteristics, demonstrating costs for training, standard inference, and RAG-augmented inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incentivizing Multi-Tenant Split Federated Learning for Foundation Models at the Network Edge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04971v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) such as GPT-4 exhibit exceptional generative capabilities across diverse downstream tasks through fine-tuning. Split Federated Learning (SFL) facilitates privacy-preserving FM fine-tuning on resource-constrained local devices by offloading partial FM computations to edge servers, enabling device-edge synergistic fine-tuning. Practical edge networks often host multiple SFL tenants to support diversified downstream tasks. However, existing research primarily focuses on single-tenant SFL scenarios, and lacks tailored incentive mechanisms for multi-tenant settings, which are essential to effectively coordinate self-interested local devices for participation in various downstream tasks, ensuring that each SFL tenant's distinct FM fine-tuning requirements (e.g., FM types, performance targets, and fine-tuning deadlines) are met. To address this gap, we propose a novel Price-Incentive Mechanism (PRINCE) that guides multiple SFL tenants to offer strategic price incentives, which solicit high-quality device participation for efficient FM fine-tuning. Specifically, we first develop a bias-resilient global SFL model aggregation scheme to eliminate model biases caused by independent device participation. We then derive a rigorous SFL convergence bound to evaluate the contributions of heterogeneous devices to FM performance improvements, guiding the incentive strategies of SFL tenants. Furthermore, we model inter-tenant device competition as a congestion game for Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) analysis, deriving each SFL tenant's optimal incentive strategy. Extensive simulations involving four representative SFL tenant types (ViT, BERT, Whisper, and LLaMA) across diverse data modalities (text, images, and audio) demonstrate that PRINCE accelerates FM fine-tuning by up to 3.07x compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while consistently meeting fine-tuning performance targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Index...</summary><p>Index Terms: Foundation models, Edge computing, Split federated learning, Multi-tenant system, Incentive mechanism</p></details> |

These can be used within data processing pipelines for machine learning tasks and numerical methods. We show how our GNPs can be trained to learn robust latent representations for the differential geometry of point-clouds to provide estimates of metric, curvature, and other shape-related features. We demonstrate how our pre-trained GNPs can be used (i) to estimate the geometric properties of surfaces of arbitrary shape and topologies with robustness in the presence of noise, (ii) to approximate solutions of geometric partial differential equations (PDEs) on manifolds, and (iii) to solve equations for shape deformations such as curvature driven flows. We also release a package of the codes and weights for using our pre-trained GNPs for processing point cloud representations. This allows for incorporating our pre-trained GNPs as components for reuse within existing and new data processing pipelines. The GNPs also can be used as part of numerical solvers involving geometry or as part of methods for performing inference and other geometric tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[TS-RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation based Time Series Foundation Models are Stronger Zero-Shot Forecaster](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07649v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Foundation Models (FMs) have become prevalent for time series forecasting tasks. However, fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for forecasting enables the adaptation to specific domains but may not generalize well across diverse, unseen datasets. Meanwhile, existing time series foundation models (TSFMs) lack inherent mechanisms for domain adaptation and suffer from limited interpretability, making them suboptimal for zero-shot forecasting. To this end, we present TS-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation based time series forecasting framework that enhances the generalization capability and interpretability of TSFMs. Specifically, TS-RAG leverages pre-trained time series encoders to retrieve semantically relevant time series segments from a dedicated knowledge database, incorporating contextual patterns for the given time series query. Next, we develop a learnable Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based augmentation module, which dynamically fuses retrieved time series patterns with the TSFM's representation of the input query, improving forecasting accuracy without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Thorough empirical studies on seven public benchmark datasets demonstrate that TS-RAG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasting performance, outperforming TSFMs by up to 6.51% across diverse domains and showcasing desired interpretability.</p></details> |  |

However, the high-dimensional sparsity, batch effect noise, category imbalance, and ever-increasing data scale of the original sequencing data pose significant challenges for multi-center knowledge transfer, data fusion, and cross-validation between scRNA-seq datasets. To address these barriers, (1) we first propose a latent codes-based scRNA-seq dataset distillation framework named scDD, which transfers and distills foundation model knowledge and original dataset information into a compact latent space and generates synthetic scRNA-seq dataset by a generator to replace the original dataset. Then, (2) we propose a single-step conditional diffusion generator named SCDG, which perform single-step gradient back-propagation to help scDD optimize distillation quality and avoid gradient decay caused by multi-step back-propagation. Meanwhile, SCDG ensures the scRNA-seq data characteristics and inter-class discriminability of the synthetic dataset through flexible conditional control and generation quality assurance. Finally, we propose a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of scRNA-seq dataset distillation in different data analysis tasks. It is validated that our proposed method can achieve 7.61% absolute and 15.70% relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods on average task.</p></details> |  |

Our DuCos is the first to significantly improve generalization across diverse scenarios with foundation models as prompts. The prompt design consists of two key components: Correlative Fusion (CF) and Gradient Regulation (GR). CF facilitates precise geometric alignment and effective fusion between prompt and depth features, while GR refines depth predictions by enforcing consistency with sharp-edged depth maps derived from foundation models. Crucially, these prompts are seamlessly embedded into the Lagrangian constraint term, forming a synergistic and principled framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DuCos outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and generalization.

We pre-train our model with two sizes (200M and 710M parameters) on a large time-series corpus comprising both real-world and synthetic datasets. Over a collection of unseen datasets across diverse domains and forecasting horizons, our empirical evaluations suggest that TimeFound can achieve superior or competitive zero-shot forecasting performance, compared to state-of-the-art time series foundation models.</p></details> |  |

However, the prediction and interpretation of these sequences remain challenging due to the intricate nature of genetic material. Large language models (LLMs) have introduced new opportunities for biological sequence analysis. Recent developments in genomic language models have underscored the potential of LLMs in deciphering DNA sequences. Nonetheless, existing models often face limitations in robustness and application scope, primarily due to constraints in model structure and training data scale. To address these limitations, we present GENERator, a generative genomic foundation model featuring a context length of 98k base pairs (bp) and 1.2B parameters. Trained on an expansive dataset comprising 386B bp of eukaryotic DNA, the GENERator demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across both established and newly proposed benchmarks. The model adheres to the central dogma of molecular biology, accurately generating protein-coding sequences that translate into proteins structurally analogous to known families. It also shows significant promise in sequence optimization, particularly through the prompt-responsive generation of enhancer sequences with specific activity profiles. These capabilities position the GENERator as a pivotal tool for genomic research and biotechnological advancement, enhancing our ability to interpret and predict complex biological systems and enabling precise genomic interventions.

Despite their impressive performance, these models often exhibit variability when applied to different tasks, prompting the need for a unified framework capable of consistently excelling across various applications. In this work, we propose Shazam, a novel framework designed to efficiently combine multiple CPath models. Unlike previous approaches that train a fixed-parameter FM, Shazam dynamically extracts and refines information from diverse FMs for each specific task. To ensure that each FM contributes effectively without dominance, a novel distillation strategy is applied, guiding the student model with features from all teacher models, which enhances its generalization ability. Experimental results on two pathology patch classification datasets demonstrate that Shazam outperforms existing CPath models and other fusion methods. Its lightweight, flexible design makes it a promising solution for improving CPath analysis in real-world settings. Code will be available at https://github.com/Tuner12/Shazam.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
