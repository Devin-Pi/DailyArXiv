| **[A Grid-Free Fluid Solver based on Gaussian Spatial Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18133v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a grid-free fluid solver featuring a novel Gaussian representation. Drawing inspiration from the expressive capabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting in multi-view image reconstruction, we model the continuous flow velocity as a weighted sum of multiple Gaussian functions. Leveraging this representation, we derive differential operators for the field and implement a time-dependent PDE solver using the traditional operator splitting method. Compared to implicit neural representations as another continuous spatial representation with increasing attention, our method with flexible 3D Gaussians presents enhanced accuracy on vorticity preservation. Moreover, we apply physics-driven strategies to accelerate the optimization-based time integration of Gaussian functions. This temporal evolution surpasses previous work based on implicit neural representation with reduced computational time and memory. Although not surpassing the quality of state-of-the-art Eulerian methods in fluid simulation, experiments and ablation studies indicate the potential of our memory-efficient representation. With enriched spatial information, our method exhibits a distinctive perspective combining the advantages of Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comprehensive Analysis of Network Robustness Evaluation Based on Convolutional Neural Networks with Spatial Pyramid Pooling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08012v2)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Connectivity robustness, a crucial aspect for understanding, optimizing, and repairing complex networks, has traditionally been evaluated through time-consuming and often impractical simulations. Fortunately, machine learning provides a new avenue for addressing this challenge. However, several key issues remain unresolved, including the performance in more general edge removal scenarios, capturing robustness through attack curves instead of directly training for robustness, scalability of predictive tasks, and transferability of predictive capabilities. In this paper, we address these challenges by designing a convolutional neural networks (CNN) model with spatial pyramid pooling networks (SPP-net), adapting existing evaluation metrics, redesigning the attack modes, introducing appropriate filtering rules, and incorporating the value of robustness as training data. The results demonstrate the thoroughness of the proposed CNN framework in addressing the challenges of high computational time across various network types, failure component types and failure scenarios. However, the performance of the proposed CNN model varies: for evaluation tasks that are consistent with the trained network type, the proposed CNN model consistently achieves accurate evaluations of both attack curves and robustness values across all removal scenarios. When the predicted network type differs from the trained network, the CNN model still demonstrates favorable performance in the scenario of random node failure, showcasing its scalability and performance transferability. Nevertheless, the performance falls short of expectations in other removal scenarios. This observed scenario-sensitivity in the evaluation of network features has been overlooked in previous studies and necessitates further attention and optimization. Lastly, we discuss important unresolved questions and further investigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables, journal</p></details> |
| **[HFGS: 4D Gaussian Splatting with Emphasis on Spatial and Temporal High-Frequency Components for Endoscopic Scene Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17872v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery benefits from enhancing dynamic scene reconstruction, as it improves surgical outcomes. While Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have been effective in scene reconstruction, their slow inference speeds and lengthy training durations limit their applicability. To overcome these limitations, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) based methods have emerged as a recent trend, offering rapid inference capabilities and superior 3D quality. However, these methods still struggle with under-reconstruction in both static and dynamic scenes. In this paper, we propose HFGS, a novel approach for deformable endoscopic reconstruction that addresses these challenges from spatial and temporal frequency perspectives. Our approach incorporates deformation fields to better handle dynamic scenes and introduces Spatial High-Frequency Emphasis Reconstruction (SHF) to minimize discrepancies in spatial frequency spectra between the rendered image and its ground truth. Additionally, we introduce Temporal High-Frequency Emphasis Reconstruction (THF) to enhance dynamic awareness in neural rendering by leveraging flow priors, focusing optimization on motion-intensive parts. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate that HFGS achieves superior rendering quality. Our code will be available.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Spatial Spinal Fixation: A Transformative Approach Using a Unique Robot-Assisted Steerable Drilling System and Flexible Pedicle Screw](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17600v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spinal fixation procedures are currently limited by the rigidity of the existing instruments and pedicle screws leading to fixation failures and rigid pedicle screw pull out. Leveraging our recently developed Concentric Tube Steerable Drilling Robot (CT-SDR) in integration with a robotic manipulator, to address the aforementioned issue, here we introduce the transformative concept of Spatial Spinal Fixation (SSF) using a unique Flexible Pedicle Screw (FPS). The proposed SSF procedure enables planar and out-of-plane placement of the FPS throughout the full volume of the vertebral body. In other words, not only does our fixation system provide the option of drilling in-plane and out-of-plane trajectories, it also enables implanting the FPS inside linear (represented by an I-shape) and/or non-linear (represented by J-shape) trajectories. To thoroughly evaluate the functionality of our proposed robotic system and the SSF procedure, we have performed various experiments by drilling different I-J and J-J drilling trajectory pairs into our custom-designed L3 vertebral phantoms and analyzed the accuracy of the procedure using various metrics.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[QQESPM: A Quantitative and Qualitative Spatial Pattern Matching Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08992v2)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Spatial Pattern Matching (SPM) query allows for the retrieval of Points of Interest (POIs) based on spatial patterns defined by keywords and distance criteria. However, it does not consider the connectivity between POIs. In this study, we introduce the Qualitative and Quantitative Spatial Pattern Matching (QQ-SPM) query, an extension of the SPM query that incorporates qualitative connectivity constraints. To answer the proposed query type, we propose the QQESPM algorithm, which adapts the state-of-the-art ESPM algorithm to handle connectivity constraints. Performance tests comparing QQESPM to a baseline approach demonstrate QQESPM's superiority in addressing the proposed query type.</p></details> | <details><summary>DBLP ...</summary><p>DBLP Entry: https://dblp.org/rec/conf/geoinfo/MinervinoCOS23.html Conference Repository: http://urlib.net/ibi/8JMKD3MGPDW34P/4ADBK2H Accepted for the Brazilian Symposium on Geoinformatics (GEOINFO 2023)</p></details> |
| **[Exploring Spatial Schema Intuitions in Large Language and Vision Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00956v2)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the ubiquity of large language models (LLMs) in AI research, the question of embodiment in LLMs remains underexplored, distinguishing them from embodied systems in robotics where sensory perception directly informs physical action. Our investigation navigates the intriguing terrain of whether LLMs, despite their non-embodied nature, effectively capture implicit human intuitions about fundamental, spatial building blocks of language. We employ insights from spatial cognitive foundations developed through early sensorimotor experiences, guiding our exploration through the reproduction of three psycholinguistic experiments. Surprisingly, correlations between model outputs and human responses emerge, revealing adaptability without a tangible connection to embodied experiences. Notable distinctions include polarized language model responses and reduced correlations in vision language models. This research contributes to a nuanced understanding of the interplay between language, spatial experiences, and the computations made by large language models.

| **[Cross-modal Diffusion Modelling for Super-resolved Spatial Transcriptomics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12973v2)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advancement of spatial transcriptomics (ST) allows to characterize spatial gene expression within tissue for discovery research. However, current ST platforms suffer from low resolution, hindering in-depth understanding of spatial gene expression. Super-resolution approaches promise to enhance ST maps by integrating histology images with gene expressions of profiled tissue spots. However, current super-resolution methods are limited by restoration uncertainty and mode collapse. Although diffusion models have shown promise in capturing complex interactions between multi-modal conditions, it remains a challenge to integrate histology images and gene expression for super-resolved ST maps. This paper proposes a cross-modal conditional diffusion model for super-resolving ST maps with the guidance of histology images. Specifically, we design a multi-modal disentangling network with cross-modal adaptive modulation to utilize complementary information from histology images and spatial gene expression. Moreover, we propose a dynamic cross-attention modelling strategy to extract hierarchical cell-to-tissue information from histology images. Lastly, we propose a co-expression-based gene-correlation graph network to model the co-expression relationship of multiple genes. Experiments show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in ST super-resolution on three public datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tilt your Head: Activating the Hidden Spatial-Invariance of Classifiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03730v2)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks are applied in more and more areas of everyday life. However, they still lack essential abilities, such as robustly dealing with spatially transformed input signals. Approaches to mitigate this severe robustness issue are limited to two pathways: Either models are implicitly regularised by increased sample variability (data augmentation) or explicitly constrained by hard-coded inductive biases. The limiting factor of the former is the size of the data space, which renders sufficient sample coverage intractable. The latter is limited by the engineering effort required to develop such inductive biases for every possible scenario. Instead, we take inspiration from human behaviour, where percepts are modified by mental or physical actions during inference. We propose a novel technique to emulate such an inference process for neural nets. This is achieved by traversing a sparsified inverse transformation tree during inference using parallel energy-based evaluations. Our proposed inference algorithm, called Inverse Transformation Search (ITS), is model-agnostic and equips the model with zero-shot pseudo-invariance to spatially transformed inputs. We evaluated our method on several benchmark datasets, including a synthesised ImageNet test set. ITS outperforms the utilised baselines on all zero-shot test scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Radiotherapy Planning with Spatially Based Uncertainty Sets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17040v2)** | 2024-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiotherapy treatment planning is a challenging large-scale optimization problem plagued by uncertainty. Following the robust optimization methodology, we propose a novel, spatially based uncertainty set for robust modeling of radiotherapy planning, producing solutions that are immune to unexpected changes in biological conditions. Our proposed uncertainty set realistically captures biological radiosensitivity patterns that are observed using recent advances in imaging, while its parameters can be personalized for individual patients. We exploit the structure of this set to devise a compact reformulation of the robust model. We develop a row-generation scheme to solve real, large-scale instances of the robust model. This method is then extended to a relaxation-based scheme for enforcing challenging, yet clinically important, dose-volume cardinality constraints. The computational performance of our algorithms, as well as the quality and robustness of the computed treatment plans, are demonstrated on simulated and real imaging data. Based on accepted performance measures, such as minimal target dose and homogeneity, these examples demonstrate that the spatially robust model achieves almost the same performance as the nominal model in the nominal scenario, and otherwise, the spatial model outperforms both the nominal and the box-uncertainty models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion4D: Fast Spatial-temporal Consistent 4D Generation via Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16645v1)** | 2024-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The availability of large-scale multimodal datasets and advancements in diffusion models have significantly accelerated progress in 4D content generation. Most prior approaches rely on multiple image or video diffusion models, utilizing score distillation sampling for optimization or generating pseudo novel views for direct supervision. However, these methods are hindered by slow optimization speeds and multi-view inconsistency issues. Spatial and temporal consistency in 4D geometry has been extensively explored respectively in 3D-aware diffusion models and traditional monocular video diffusion models. Building on this foundation, we propose a strategy to migrate the temporal consistency in video diffusion models to the spatial-temporal consistency required for 4D generation. Specifically, we present a novel framework, \textbf{Diffusion4D}, for efficient and scalable 4D content generation. Leveraging a meticulously curated dynamic 3D dataset, we develop a 4D-aware video diffusion model capable of synthesizing orbital views of dynamic 3D assets. To control the dynamic strength of these assets, we introduce a 3D-to-4D motion magnitude metric as guidance. Additionally, we propose a novel motion magnitude reconstruction loss and 3D-aware classifier-free guidance to refine the learning and generation of motion dynamics. After obtaining orbital views of the 4D asset, we perform explicit 4D construction with Gaussian splatting in a coarse-to-fine manner. The synthesized multi-view consistent 4D image set enables us to swiftly generate high-fidelity and diverse 4D assets within just several minutes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art techniques in terms of generation efficiency and 4D geometry consistency across various prompt modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://vita-group.github.io/Diffusion4D</p></details> |

In this paper we present BAT, which combines the spatial sound perception ability of a binaural acoustic scene analysis model with the natural language reasoning capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to replicate this innate ability. To address the lack of existing datasets of in-the-wild spatial sounds, we synthesized a binaural audio dataset using AudioSet and SoundSpaces 2.0. Next, we developed SpatialSoundQA, a spatial sound-based question-answering dataset, offering a range of QA tasks that train BAT in various aspects of spatial sound perception and reasoning. The acoustic front end encoder of BAT is a novel spatial audio encoder named Spatial Audio Spectrogram Transformer, or Spatial-AST, which by itself achieves strong performance across sound event detection, spatial localization, and distance estimation. By integrating Spatial-AST with LLaMA-2 7B model, BAT transcends standard Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) tasks, enabling the model to reason about the relationships between the sounds in its environment. Our experiments demonstrate BAT's superior performance on both spatial sound perception and reasoning, showcasing the immense potential of LLMs in navigating and interpreting complex spatial audio environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2024.

| **[Spatial Mode Multiplexing for Fiber-Coupled IM/DD Optical Wireless Links with Misalignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12667v2)** | 2024-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical wireless communication (OWC) emerges as a pivotal solution for achieving terabit-level aggregate throughput in next-generation wireless networks. With the mature high-speed transceivers and advanced (de)multiplexing techniques designed for fiber optics, fiber-coupled OWC can be seamlessly integrated into existing ultra-high-speed networks such as data centres. In particular, OWC leveraging spatial mode multiplexing (SMM) and few-mode fiber (FMF) coupling can significantly increase capacity, though misalignment may reduce performance. This paper presents a thorough investigation into the SMM-enabled FMF coupling OWC systems affected by link misalignment, specifically focusing on systems with intensity modulation with direct detection (IM/DD) receivers. A theoretical analysis is conducted to assess the fiber coupling efficiency of the considered system in the presence of both pointing error and angle of arrival (AOA) fluctuations caused by random device vibrations. Our model elucidates the dependence of coupling efficiency to the order of the incident modes, highlighting the critical role of beam properties in system performance. To mitigate the intermodal crosstalk arising from link misalignment, we employ zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) to enhance the overall aggregated data rate. Through extensive numerical results, we identify optimal system configurations encompassing aperture design and mode selection, leading to a capacity boost exceeding 200%.</p></details> | 13 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Low-Light Video Enhancement via Spatial-Temporal Consistent Illumination and Reflection Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15660v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-Light Video Enhancement (LLVE) seeks to restore dynamic and static scenes plagued by severe invisibility and noise. One critical aspect is formulating a consistency constraint specifically for temporal-spatial illumination and appearance enhanced versions, a dimension overlooked in existing methods. In this paper, we present an innovative video Retinex-based decomposition strategy that operates without the need for explicit supervision to delineate illumination and reflectance components. We leverage dynamic cross-frame correspondences for intrinsic appearance and enforce a scene-level continuity constraint on the illumination field to yield satisfactory consistent decomposition results. To further ensure consistent decomposition, we introduce a dual-structure enhancement network featuring a novel cross-frame interaction mechanism. This mechanism can seamlessly integrate with encoder-decoder single-frame networks, incurring minimal additional parameter costs. By supervising different frames simultaneously, this network encourages them to exhibit matching decomposition features, thus achieving the desired temporal propagation. Extensive experiments are conducted on widely recognized LLVE benchmarks, covering diverse scenarios. Our framework consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.</p></details> |  |

This work extends the Latent Dirichlet Variational Autoencoder (LDVAE) pixel unmixing scheme by taking into account local spatial context while performing pixel unmixing. The proposed method uses an isotropic convolutional neural network with spatial attention to encode pixels as a dirichlet distribution over endmembers. We have evaluated our model on Samson, Hydice Urban, Cuprite, and OnTech-HSI-Syn-21 datasets. Our model also leverages the transfer learning paradigm for Cuprite Dataset, where we train the model on synthetic data and evaluate it on the real-world data. The results suggest that incorporating spatial context improves both endmember extraction and abundance estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IGARSS 2024</p></details> |
| **[CPT-Interp: Continuous sPatial and Temporal Motion Modeling for 4D Medical Image Interpolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15385v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion information from 4D medical imaging offers critical insights into dynamic changes in patient anatomy for clinical assessments and radiotherapy planning and, thereby, enhances the capabilities of 3D image analysis. However, inherent physical and technical constraints of imaging hardware often necessitate a compromise between temporal resolution and image quality. Frame interpolation emerges as a pivotal solution to this challenge. Previous methods often suffer from discretion when they estimate the intermediate motion and execute the forward warping. In this study, we draw inspiration from fluid mechanics to propose a novel approach for continuously modeling patient anatomic motion using implicit neural representation. It ensures both spatial and temporal continuity, effectively bridging Eulerian and Lagrangian specifications together to naturally facilitate continuous frame interpolation. Our experiments across multiple datasets underscore the method's superior accuracy and speed. Furthermore, as a case-specific optimization (training-free) approach, it circumvents the need for extensive datasets and addresses model generalization issues.</p></details> |  |

While often spatial data is represented in a tabular format, a graph based representation provides the possibility to interconnect entities which would have been separated in a tabular representation. We propose in our paper a framework which supports a planet scale transformation of OpenStreetMap data into a Spatial Temporal Knowledge Graph. In addition to OpenStreetMap data, we align the different OpenStreetMap geometries on individual h3 grid cells. We compare our constructed spatial knowledge graph to other spatial knowledge graphs and outline our contribution in this paper. As a basis for our computation, we use Apache Sedona as a computational framework for our Spatial Temporal Knowledge Graph construction</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, GeoLD2024: 6th Geospatial Linked Data Workshop, May 26, 2024, Hersonissos, Greece</p></details> |
| **[Mind's Eye of LLMs: Visualization-of-Thought Elicits Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03622v2)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive performance in language comprehension and various reasoning tasks. However, their abilities in spatial reasoning, a crucial aspect of human cognition, remain relatively unexplored. Human possess a remarkable ability to create mental images of unseen objects and actions through a process known as the Mind's Eye, enabling the imagination of the unseen world. Inspired by this cognitive capacity, we propose Visualization-of-Thought (VoT) prompting. VoT aims to elicit spatial reasoning of LLMs by visualizing their reasoning traces, thereby guiding subsequent reasoning steps. We employed VoT for multi-hop spatial reasoning tasks, including natural language navigation, visual navigation, and visual tiling in 2D grid worlds. Experimental results demonstrated that VoT significantly enhances the spatial reasoning abilities of LLMs. Notably, VoT outperformed existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in these tasks. While VoT works surprisingly well on LLMs, the ability to generate mental images to facilitate spatial reasoning resembles the mind's eye process, suggesting its potential viability in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Facilitating Battery Swapping Services for Freight Trucks with Spatial-Temporal Demand Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04440v2)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electrifying heavy-duty trucks offers a substantial opportunity to curtail carbon emissions, advancing toward a carbon-neutral future. However, the inherent challenges of limited battery energy and the sheer weight of heavy-duty trucks lead to reduced mileage and prolonged charging durations. Consequently, battery-swapping services emerge as an attractive solution for these trucks. This paper employs a two-fold approach to investigate the potential and enhance the efficacy of such services. Firstly, spatial-temporal demand prediction models are adopted to predict the traffic patterns for the upcoming hours. Subsequently, the prediction guides an optimization module for efficient battery allocation and deployment. Analyzing the heavy-duty truck data on a highway network spanning over 2,500 miles, our model and analysis underscore the value of prediction/machine learning in facilitating future decision-makings. In particular, we find that the initial phase of implementing battery-swapping services favors mobile battery-swapping stations, but as the system matures, fixed-location stations are preferred.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Reframing Spatial Reasoning Evaluation in Language Models: A Real-World Simulation Benchmark for Qualitative Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15064v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial reasoning plays a vital role in both human cognition and machine intelligence, prompting new research into language models' (LMs) capabilities in this regard. However, existing benchmarks reveal shortcomings in evaluating qualitative spatial reasoning (QSR). These benchmarks typically present oversimplified scenarios or unclear natural language descriptions, hindering effective evaluation. We present a novel benchmark for assessing QSR in LMs, which is grounded in realistic 3D simulation data, offering a series of diverse room layouts with various objects and their spatial relationships. This approach provides a more detailed and context-rich narrative for spatial reasoning evaluation, diverging from traditional, toy-task-oriented scenarios. Our benchmark encompasses a broad spectrum of qualitative spatial relationships, including topological, directional, and distance relations. These are presented with different viewing points, varied granularities, and density of relation constraints to mimic real-world complexities. A key contribution is our logic-based consistency-checking tool, which enables the assessment of multiple plausible solutions, aligning with real-world scenarios where spatial relationships are often open to interpretation. Our benchmark evaluation of advanced LMs reveals their strengths and limitations in spatial reasoning. They face difficulties with multi-hop spatial reasoning and interpreting a mix of different view descriptions, pointing to areas for future improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-Ready version for IJCAI 2024</p></details> |
| **[Consistent Validation for Predictive Methods in Spatial Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03527v2)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial prediction tasks are key to weather forecasting, studying air pollution, and other scientific endeavors. Determining how much to trust predictions made by statistical or physical methods is essential for the credibility of scientific conclusions. Unfortunately, classical approaches for validation fail to handle mismatch between locations available for validation and (test) locations where we want to make predictions. This mismatch is often not an instance of covariate shift (as commonly formalized) because the validation and test locations are fixed (e.g., on a grid or at select points) rather than i.i.d. from two distributions. In the present work, we formalize a check on validation methods: that they become arbitrarily accurate as validation data becomes arbitrarily dense. We show that classical and covariate-shift methods can fail this check. We instead propose a method that builds from existing ideas in the covariate-shift literature, but adapts them to the validation data at hand. We prove that our proposal passes our check. And we demonstrate its advantages empirically on simulated and real data.</p></details> | 52 pages, 14 figures |
| **[SSUMamba: Spatial-Spectral Selective State Space Model for Hyperspectral Image Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01726v5)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising is a crucial preprocessing procedure for hyperspectral images (HSIs) due to the noise originating from intra-imaging mechanisms and environmental factors. Utilizing domain knowledge of HSIs, such as spectral correlation, spatial self-similarity, and spatial-spectral correlation, is essential for deep learning-based denoising. Existing methods are often constrained by running time, space complexity, and computational complexity, employing strategies that explore these kinds of domain knowledge separately. While these strategies can avoid some redundant information, they inevitably overlook broader and more in-depth long-range spatial-spectral information that positively impacts image restoration. This paper proposes a Spatial-Spectral Selective State Space Model-based U-shaped network, Spatial-Spectral U-Mamba (SSUMamba), for hyperspectral image denoising. The SSUMamba can exploit complete global spatial-spectral correlation within a module thanks to the linear space complexity in State Space Model (SSM) computations. We introduce a Spatial-Spectral Alternating Zigzag Scan (SSAZS) strategy for HSIs, which helps exploit the continuous information flow in multiple directions of 3-D characteristics within HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms comparison methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/lronkitty/SSUMamba.</p></details> |  |

The existing video editing methods usually apply the typical 2D DDIM inversion or naive spatial-temporal DDIM inversion before editing, which leverages time-varying representation for each frame to derive noisy latent. Unlike most existing approaches, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Expectation-Maximization (STEM) inversion, which formulates the dense video feature under an expectation-maximization manner and iteratively estimates a more compact basis set to represent the whole video. Each frame applies the fixed and global representation for inversion, which is more friendly for temporal consistency during reconstruction and editing. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our STEM inversion can achieve consistent improvement on two state-of-the-art video editing methods.

| **[Synergizing Spatial Optimization with Large Language Models for Open-Domain Urban Itinerary Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07204v2)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the novel task of Open-domain Urban Itinerary Planning (OUIP), a paradigm designed to generate personalized urban itineraries from user requests articulated in natural language. This approach is different from traditional itinerary planning, which often restricts the granularity of user inputs, thus hindering genuine personalization. To this end, we present ItiNera, an OUIP system that synergizes spatial optimization with large language models (LLMs) to provide services that customize urban itineraries based on users' needs. Upon receiving the user's itinerary request, the LLM first decomposes it into detailed components, identifying key requirements, including preferences and dislikes. Then, we use these specifics to select candidate POIs from a large-scale collection using embedding-based Preference-aware POI Retrieval. Finally, a preference score-based Cluster-aware Spatial Optimization module clusters, filters, and orders these POIs, followed by the LLM for detailed POI selection and organization to craft a personalized, spatially coherent itinerary. Moreover, we created an LLM-based pipeline to update and personalize a user-owned POI database. This ensures up-to-date POI information, supports itinerary planning, pre-trip research, POI collection, recommendations, and more. To the best of our knowledge, this study marks the first integration of LLMs to innovate itinerary planning, with potential extensions for various urban travel and exploration activities. Offline and online evaluations demonstrate the capacity of our system to deliver more responsive, personalized, and spatially coherent itineraries than current solutions. Our system, deployed on an online platform, has attracted thousands of users for their urban travel planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Create New Knowledge for Spatial Reasoning Tasks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14379v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The potential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate new information offers a potential step change for research and innovation. This is challenging to assert as it can be difficult to determine what an LLM has previously seen during training, making "newness" difficult to substantiate. In this paper we observe that LLMs are able to perform sophisticated reasoning on problems with a spatial dimension, that they are unlikely to have previously directly encountered. While not perfect, this points to a significant level of understanding that state-of-the-art LLMs can now achieve, supporting the proposition that LLMs are able to yield significant emergent properties. In particular, Claude 3 is found to perform well in this regard.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAMBA4D: Efficient Long-Sequence Point Cloud Video Understanding with Disentangled Spatial-Temporal State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14338v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud videos effectively capture real-world spatial geometries and temporal dynamics, which are essential for enabling intelligent agents to understand the dynamically changing 3D world we live in. Although static 3D point cloud processing has witnessed significant advancements, designing an effective 4D point cloud video backbone remains challenging, mainly due to the irregular and unordered distribution of points and temporal inconsistencies across frames. Moreover, recent state-of-the-art 4D backbones predominantly rely on transformer-based architectures, which commonly suffer from large computational costs due to their quadratic complexity, particularly when processing long video sequences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel 4D point cloud video understanding backbone based on the recently advanced State Space Models (SSMs). Specifically, our backbone begins by disentangling space and time in raw 4D sequences, and then establishing spatio-temporal correlations using our newly developed Intra-frame Spatial Mamba and Inter-frame Temporal Mamba blocks. The Intra-frame Spatial Mamba module is designed to encode locally similar or related geometric structures within a certain temporal searching stride, which can effectively capture short-term dynamics. Subsequently, these locally correlated tokens are delivered to the Inter-frame Temporal Mamba module, which globally integrates point features across the entire video with linear complexity, further establishing long-range motion dependencies. Experimental results on human action recognition and 4D semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method. Especially, for long video sequences, our proposed Mamba-based method has an 87.5% GPU memory reduction, 5.36 times speed-up, and much higher accuracy (up to +10.4%) compared with transformer-based counterparts on MSR-Action3D dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Spectral Graph Neural Networks with Spatially Adaptive Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09071v4)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whilst spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are theoretically well-founded in the spectral domain, their practical reliance on polynomial approximation implies a profound linkage to the spatial domain. As previous studies rarely examine spectral GNNs from the spatial perspective, their spatial-domain interpretability remains elusive, e.g., what information is essentially encoded by spectral GNNs in the spatial domain? In this paper, to answer this question, we investigate the theoretical connection between spectral filtering and spatial aggregation, unveiling an intrinsic interaction that spectral filtering implicitly leads the original graph to an adapted new graph, explicitly computed for spatial aggregation. Both theoretical and empirical investigations reveal that the adapted new graph not only exhibits non-locality but also accommodates signed edge weights to reflect label consistency among nodes. These findings thus highlight the interpretable role of spectral GNNs in the spatial domain and inspire us to rethink graph spectral filters beyond the fixed-order polynomials, which neglect global information. Built upon the theoretical findings, we revisit the state-of-the-art spectral GNNs and propose a novel Spatially Adaptive Filtering (SAF) framework, which leverages the adapted new graph by spectral filtering for an auxiliary non-local aggregation. Notably, our SAF comprehensively models both node similarity and dissimilarity from a global perspective, therefore alleviating persistent deficiencies of GNNs related to long-range dependencies and graph heterophily. Extensive experiments over 13 node classification benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Typically, exposure to air pollution for an individual is measured at their home geographic region, though people travel to different regions with potentially different levels of air pollution. To account for this, we incorporate estimates of the mobility of individuals from cell phone mobility data to get an improved estimate of their exposure to air pollution. We treat this as an interference problem, where individuals in one geographic region can be affected by exposures in other regions due to mobility into those areas. We propose policy-relevant estimands and derive expressions showing the extent of bias one would obtain by ignoring this mobility. We additionally highlight the benefits of the proposed interference framework relative to a measurement error framework for accounting for mobility. We develop novel estimation strategies to estimate causal effects that account for this spatial spillover utilizing flexible Bayesian methodology. Lastly, we use the proposed methodology to study the health effects of ambient air pollution on mortality among Medicare enrollees in the United States.</p></details> |  |

Traditional hashing methods, primarily based on deep learning, often fail to capture spatial information adequately and lack transparency. In this paper, we introduce NeuroHash, a novel neuro-symbolic framework leveraging Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) to enable highly customizable, spatially-aware image retrieval. NeuroHash combines pre-trained deep neural network models with HDC-based symbolic models, allowing for flexible manipulation of hash values to support conditional image retrieval. Our method includes a self-supervised context-aware HDC encoder and novel loss terms for optimizing lower-dimensional bipolar hashing using multilinear hyperplanes. We evaluate NeuroHash on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art hashing methods, as measured by mAP@5K scores and our newly introduced metric, mAP@5Kr, which assesses spatial alignment. The results highlight NeuroHash's ability to achieve competitive performance while offering significant advantages in flexibility and customization, paving the way for more advanced and versatile image retrieval systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Normalizing Basis Functions: Approximate Stationary Models for Large Spatial Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13821v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In geostatistics, traditional spatial models often rely on the Gaussian Process (GP) to fit stationary covariances to data. It is well known that this approach becomes computationally infeasible when dealing with large data volumes, necessitating the use of approximate methods. A powerful class of methods approximate the GP as a sum of basis functions with random coefficients. Although this technique offers computational efficiency, it does not inherently guarantee a stationary covariance. To mitigate this issue, the basis functions can be "normalized" to maintain a constant marginal variance, avoiding unwanted artifacts and edge effects. This allows for the fitting of nearly stationary models to large, potentially non-stationary datasets, providing a rigorous base to extend to more complex problems. Unfortunately, the process of normalizing these basis functions is computationally demanding. To address this, we introduce two fast and accurate algorithms to the normalization step, allowing for efficient prediction on fine grids. The practical value of these algorithms is showcased in the context of a spatial analysis on a large dataset, where significant computational speedups are achieved. While implementation and testing are done specifically within the LatticeKrig framework, these algorithms can be adapted to other basis function methods operating on regular grids.</p></details> |  |

We substitute the default differencing scheme for the convection term by a feed-forward neural network that interpolates velocities from cell centers to face values to produce velocities that approximate the fine-mesh data well. The deep learning framework incorporates the open-source CFD code OpenFOAM, resulting in an end-to-end differentiable model. We automatically differentiate the CFD physics using a discrete adjoint code version. We present a fast communication method between TensorFlow (Python) and OpenFOAM (c++) that accelerates the training process. We applied the model to the flow past a square cylinder problem, reducing the error to about 50% for simulations outside the training distribution compared to the traditional solver in the x- and y-velocity components using an 8x coarser mesh. The training is affordable in terms of time and data samples since the architecture exploits the local features of the physics while generating stable predictions for mid-term simulations.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods are limited in highway or highly simplified intersection scenarios due to the intricacy and diversity of traffic scenarios. In response, we propose Traffic Scenario Logic (TSL), which is a spatial-temporal logic designed for modeling and reasoning of urban pedestrian-free traffic scenarios. TSL provides a formal representation of the urban road network that can be derived from OpenDRIVE, i.e., the de facto industry standard of high-definition maps for autonomous driving, enabling the representation of a broad range of traffic scenarios. We implemented the reasoning of TSL using Telingo, i.e., a solver for temporal programs based on the Answer Set Programming, and tested it on different urban road layouts. Demonstrations show the effectiveness of TSL in test scenario generation and its potential value in areas like decision-making and control verification of autonomous driving.</p></details> | Submitted to KR 2024 |

VFMs are endowed with distinct capabilities stemming from their pre-training objectives. For instance, CLIP excels in semantic understanding, while SAM specializes in spatial understanding for segmentation. In this work, we introduce a simple recipe to efficiently merge VFMs into a unified model that absorbs their expertise. Our method integrates techniques of multi-task learning, continual learning, and distillation. Further, it demands significantly less computational cost compared to traditional multi-task training from scratch, and it only needs a small fraction of the pre-training datasets that were initially used to train individual models. By applying our method to SAM and CLIP, we obtain SAM-CLIP: a unified model that combines the capabilities of SAM and CLIP into a single vision transformer. Compared with deploying SAM and CLIP independently, our merged model, SAM-CLIP, reduces storage and compute costs for inference, making it well-suited for edge device applications. We show that SAM-CLIP not only retains the foundational strengths of SAM and CLIP, but also introduces synergistic functionalities, notably in zero-shot semantic segmentation, where SAM-CLIP establishes new state-of-the-art results on 5 benchmarks. It outperforms previous models that are specifically designed for this task by a large margin, including +6.8% and +5.9% mean IoU improvement on Pascal-VOC and COCO-Stuff datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |

The unlabeled data consisting of both normal and abnormal data is not well explored. We introduce a novel Spatial-aware Attention Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN) for one-class semi-supervised generation of health images.Our core insight is the utilization of position encoding and attention to accurately focus on restoring abnormal regions and preserving normal regions. To fully utilize the unlabelled data, SAGAN relaxes the cyclic consistency requirement of the existing unpaired image-to-image conversion methods, and generates high-quality health images corresponding to unlabeled data, guided by the reconstruction of normal images and restoration of pseudo-anomaly images.Subsequently, the discrepancy between the generated healthy image and the original image is utilized as an anomaly score.Extensive experiments on three medical datasets demonstrate that the proposed SAGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Early...</summary><p>Early Accept by MICCAI 2024</p></details> |

Our analysis identifies a pattern of interconnected, multi-faceted tasks encompassing both AI and general computational processes. In response, we have conceptualized "Orchestrated AI Workflows," an approach that integrates various tasks with logic-driven decisions into dynamic, sophisticated workflows. Specifically, we find that the intrinsic Dual Dynamicity of Orchestrated AI Workflows, namely dynamic execution times and frequencies of Task Blocks, can be effectively represented using the Orchestrated Workflow Graph. Furthermore, the intrinsic Dual Dynamicity poses challenges to existing spatial architecture, namely Indiscriminate Resource Allocation, Reactive Load Rebalancing, and Contagious PEA Idleness. To overcome these challenges, we present Octopus, a scale-out spatial architecture and a suite of advanced scheduling strategies optimized for executing Orchestrated AI Workflows, such as the Discriminate Dual-Scheduling Mechanism, Adaptive TBU Scheduling Strategy, and Proactive Cluster Scheduling Strategy. Our evaluations demonstrate that Octopus significantly outperforms traditional architectures in handling the dynamic demands of Orchestrated AI Workflows, and possesses robust scalability in large scale hardware such as wafer-scale chip.</p></details> |  |
| **[DisenStudio: Customized Multi-subject Text-to-Video Generation with Disentangled Spatial Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12796v1)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating customized content in videos has received increasing attention recently. However, existing works primarily focus on customized text-to-video generation for single subject, suffering from subject-missing and attribute-binding problems when the video is expected to contain multiple subjects. Furthermore, existing models struggle to assign the desired actions to the corresponding subjects (action-binding problem), failing to achieve satisfactory multi-subject generation performance. To tackle the problems, in this paper, we propose DisenStudio, a novel framework that can generate text-guided videos for customized multiple subjects, given few images for each subject. Specifically, DisenStudio enhances a pretrained diffusion-based text-to-video model with our proposed spatial-disentangled cross-attention mechanism to associate each subject with the desired action. Then the model is customized for the multiple subjects with the proposed motion-preserved disentangled finetuning, which involves three tuning strategies: multi-subject co-occurrence tuning, masked single-subject tuning, and multi-subject motion-preserved tuning. The first two strategies guarantee the subject occurrence and preserve their visual attributes, and the third strategy helps the model maintain the temporal motion-generation ability when finetuning on static images. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate our proposed DisenStudio significantly outperforms existing methods in various metrics. Additionally, we show that DisenStudio can be used as a powerful tool for various controllable generation applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[SARA: Controllable Makeup Transfer with Spatial Alignment and Region-Adaptive Normalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16828v2)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Makeup transfer is a process of transferring the makeup style from a reference image to the source images, while preserving the source images' identities. This technique is highly desirable and finds many applications. However, existing methods lack fine-level control of the makeup style, making it challenging to achieve high-quality results when dealing with large spatial misalignments. To address this problem, we propose a novel Spatial Alignment and Region-Adaptive normalization method (SARA) in this paper. Our method generates detailed makeup transfer results that can handle large spatial misalignments and achieve part-specific and shade-controllable makeup transfer. Specifically, SARA comprises three modules: Firstly, a spatial alignment module that preserves the spatial context of makeup and provides a target semantic map for guiding the shape-independent style codes. Secondly, a region-adaptive normalization module that decouples shape and makeup style using per-region encoding and normalization, which facilitates the elimination of spatial misalignments. Lastly, a makeup fusion module blends identity features and makeup style by injecting learned scale and bias parameters. Experimental results show that our SARA method outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Models for Crowdsourced Internet Access Network Performance Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11138v2)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant investments in access network infrastructure, universal access to high-quality Internet connectivity remains a challenge. Policymakers often rely on large-scale, crowdsourced measurement datasets to assess the distribution of access network performance across geographic areas. These decisions typically rest on the assumption that Internet performance is uniformly distributed within predefined social boundaries, such as zip codes, census tracts, or community areas. However, this assumption may not be valid for two reasons: (1) crowdsourced measurements often exhibit non-uniform sampling densities within geographic areas; and (2) predefined social boundaries may not align with the actual boundaries of Internet infrastructure. In this paper, we model Internet performance as a spatial process. We apply and evaluate a series of statistical techniques to: (1) aggregate Internet performance over a geographic region; (2) overlay interpolated maps with various sampling boundary choices; and (3) spatially cluster boundary units to identify areas with similar performance characteristics. We evaluated the effectiveness of these using a 17-month-long crowdsourced dataset from Ookla Speedtest. We evaluate several leading interpolation methods at varying spatial scales. Further, we examine the similarity between the resulting boundaries for smaller realizations of the dataset. Our findings suggest that our combination of techniques achieves a 56% gain in similarity score over traditional methods that rely on aggregates over raw measurement values for performance summarization. Our work highlights an urgent need for more sophisticated strategies in understanding and addressing Internet access disparities.</p></details> | 13 pages |

It remains a challenging problem to model the spatial-temporal dynamics under privacy concern. Federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a framework to enable model training across distributed devices without sharing original data which reduce privacy concern. Personalized federated learning (PFL) methods further address data heterogenous problem. However, these methods don't consider natural spatial relations among nodes. For the sake of modeling spatial relations, Graph Neural Netowork (GNN) based FL approach have been proposed. But dynamic spatial-temporal relations among edge nodes are not taken into account. Several approaches model spatial-temporal dynamics in a centralized environment, while less effort has been made under federated setting. To overcome these challeges, we propose a novel Federated Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Attention (FedASTA) framework to model the dynamic spatial-temporal relations. On the client node, FedASTA extracts temporal relations and trend patterns from the decomposed terms of original time series. Then, on the server node, FedASTA utilize trend patterns from clients to construct adaptive temporal-spatial aware graph which captures dynamic correlation between clients. Besides, we design a masked spatial attention module with both static graph and constructed adaptive graph to model spatial dependencies among clients. Extensive experiments on five real-world public traffic flow datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-art performance in federated scenario. In addition, the experiments made in centralized setting show the effectiveness of our novel adaptive graph construction approach compared with other popular dynamic spatial-temporal aware methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial and Modal Optimal Transport for Fast Cross-Modal MRI Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02774v3)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in comprehensive disease diagnosis in clinical medicine. However, acquiring certain modalities, such as T2-weighted images (T2WIs), is time-consuming and prone to be with motion artifacts. It negatively impacts subsequent multi-modal image analysis. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework that utilizes T1-weighted images (T1WIs) as auxiliary modalities to expedite T2WIs' acquisitions. While image pre-processing is capable of mitigating misalignment, improper parameter selection leads to adverse pre-processing effects, requiring iterative experimentation and adjustment. To overcome this shortage, we employ Optimal Transport (OT) to synthesize T2WIs by aligning T1WIs and performing cross-modal synthesis, effectively mitigating spatial misalignment effects. Furthermore, we adopt an alternating iteration framework between the reconstruction task and the cross-modal synthesis task to optimize the final results. Then, we prove that the reconstructed T2WIs and the synthetic T2WIs become closer on the T2 image manifold with iterations increasing, and further illustrate that the improved reconstruction result enhances the synthesis process, whereas the enhanced synthesis result improves the reconstruction process. Finally, experimental results from FastMRI and internal datasets confirm the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating significant improvements in image reconstruction quality even at low sampling rates.</p></details> |  |

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have demonstrated impressive capability in capturing spectral-spatial contextual dependencies. However, these architectures suffer from limited receptive fields and quadratic computational complexity, respectively. Fortunately, recent Mamba architectures built upon the State Space Model integrate the advantages of long-range sequence modeling and linear computational efficiency, exhibiting substantial potential in low-dimensional scenarios. Motivated by this, we propose a novel 3D-Spectral-Spatial Mamba (3DSS-Mamba) framework for HSI classification, allowing for global spectral-spatial relationship modeling with greater computational efficiency. Technically, a spectral-spatial token generation (SSTG) module is designed to convert the HSI cube into a set of 3D spectral-spatial tokens. To overcome the limitations of traditional Mamba, which is confined to modeling causal sequences and inadaptable to high-dimensional scenarios, a 3D-Spectral-Spatial Selective Scanning (3DSS) mechanism is introduced, which performs pixel-wise selective scanning on 3D hyperspectral tokens along the spectral and spatial dimensions. Five scanning routes are constructed to investigate the impact of dimension prioritization. The 3DSS scanning mechanism combined with conventional mapping operations forms the 3D-spectral-spatial mamba block (3DMB), enabling the extraction of global spectral-spatial semantic representations. Experimental results and analysis demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on HSI classification benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

A key theme in existing GCD approaches is adapting large-scale pre-trained models for the GCD task. An alternate perspective, however, is to adapt the data representation itself for better alignment with the pre-trained model. As such, in this paper, we introduce a two-stage adaptation approach termed SPTNet, which iteratively optimizes model parameters (i.e., model-finetuning) and data parameters (i.e., prompt learning). Furthermore, we propose a novel spatial prompt tuning method (SPT) which considers the spatial property of image data, enabling the method to better focus on object parts, which can transfer between seen and unseen classes. We thoroughly evaluate our SPTNet on standard benchmarks and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing GCD methods. Notably, we find our method achieves an average accuracy of 61.4% on the SSB, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods by approximately 10%. The improvement is particularly remarkable as our method yields extra parameters amounting to only 0.117% of those in the backbone architecture.

Existing methods compute the similarity between the query image and exemplars in the 2D spatial domain and perform regression to obtain the counting number. However, these methods overlook the rich information about the spatial distribution of similarity on the exemplar images, leading to significant impact on matching accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a network learning Spatial Similarity Distribution (SSD) for few-shot object counting, which preserves the spatial structure of exemplar features and calculates a 4D similarity pyramid point-to-point between the query features and exemplar features, capturing the complete distribution information for each point in the 4D similarity space. We propose a Similarity Learning Module (SLM) which applies the efficient center-pivot 4D convolutions on the similarity pyramid to map different similarity distributions to distinct predicted density values, thereby obtaining accurate count. Furthermore, we also introduce a Feature Cross Enhancement (FCE) module that enhances query and exemplar features mutually to improve the accuracy of feature matching. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets, including FSC-147 and CARPK.

However, the precision of estimating the SAR model diminishes when the sample size of the target data is limited. In this paper, we propose a new transfer learning framework for the SAR model to borrow the information from similar source data to improve both estimation and prediction. When the informative source data sets are known, we introduce a two-stage algorithm, including a transferring stage and a debiasing stage, to estimate the unknown parameters and also establish the theoretical convergence rates for the resulting estimators. If we do not know which sources to transfer, a transferable source detection algorithm is proposed to detect informative sources data based on spatial residual bootstrap to retain the necessary spatial dependence. Its detection consistency is also derived. Simulation studies demonstrate that using informative source data, our transfer learning algorithm significantly enhances the performance of the classical two-stage least squares estimator. In the empirical application, we apply our method to the election prediction in swing states in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, utilizing polling data from the 2016 U.S. presidential election along with other demographic and geographical data. The empirical results show that our method outperforms traditional estimation methods.</p></details> |  |

Most rs-fMRI studies compute a single static functional connectivity matrix across brain regions of interest, or dynamic functional connectivity matrices with a sliding window approach. These approaches are at risk of oversimplifying brain dynamics and lack proper consideration of the goal at hand. While deep learning has gained substantial popularity for modeling complex relational data, its application to uncovering the spatiotemporal dynamics of the brain is still limited. We propose a novel interpretable deep learning framework that learns goal-specific functional connectivity matrix directly from time series and employs a specialized graph neural network for the final classification. Our model, DSAM, leverages temporal causal convolutional networks to capture the temporal dynamics in both low- and high-level feature representations, a temporal attention unit to identify important time points, a self-attention unit to construct the goal-specific connectivity matrix, and a novel variant of graph neural network to capture the spatial dynamics for downstream classification. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments on the Human Connectome Project dataset with 1075 samples to build and interpret the model for the classification of sex group, and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Dataset with 8520 samples for independent testing. Compared our proposed framework with other state-of-art models, results suggested this novel approach goes beyond the assumption of a fixed connectivity matrix and provides evidence of goal-specific brain connectivity patterns, which opens up the potential to gain deeper insights into how the human brain adapts its functional connectivity specific to the task at hand.</p></details> | 18 Pages, 4 figures |

In the past few years, various GNN-based methods have been proposed to solely focus on mimicking the relationships among node individuals of the STG network, ignoring the significance of modeling the intrinsic features that exist in STG system over time. In contrast, modern Selective State Space Models (SSSMs) present a new approach which treat STG Network as a system, and meticulously explore the STG system's dynamic state evolution across temporal dimension. In this work, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Graph Mamba (STG-Mamba) as the first exploration of leveraging the powerful selective state space models for STG learning by treating STG Network as a system, and employing the Spatial-Temporal Selective State Space Module (ST-S3M) to precisely focus on the selected STG latent features. Furthermore, to strengthen GNN's ability of modeling STG data under the setting of selective state space models, we propose Kalman Filtering Graph Neural Networks (KFGN) for dynamically integrate and upgrade the STG embeddings from different temporal granularities through a learnable Kalman Filtering statistical theory-based approach. Extensive empirical studies are conducted on three benchmark STG forecasting datasets, demonstrating the performance superiority and computational efficiency of STG-Mamba. It not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of STG forecasting performance, but also effectively alleviate the computational bottleneck of large-scale graph networks in reducing the computational cost of FLOPs and test inference time. The implementation code is available at: \url{https://github.com/LincanLi98/STG-Mamba}.</p></details> |  |

The current challenges of traffic flow prediction lie in integrating diverse factors while balancing the trade-off between computational complexity and the precision necessary for effective long-range and large-scale predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce a Spatial-Temporal Selective State Space (ST-Mamba) model, which is the first to leverage the power of spatial-temporal learning in traffic flow prediction without using graph modeling. The ST-Mamba model can effectively capture the long-range dependency for traffic flow data, thereby avoiding the issue of over-smoothing. The proposed ST-Mamba model incorporates an effective Spatial-Temporal Mixer (ST-Mixer) to seamlessly integrate spatial and temporal data processing into a unified framework and employs a Spatial-Temporal Selective State Space (ST-SSM) block to improve computational efficiency. The proposed ST-Mamba model, specifically designed for spatial-temporal data, simplifies processing procedure and enhances generalization capabilities, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of long-range traffic flow prediction. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) model, the proposed ST-Mamba model achieves a 61.11\% improvement in computational speed and increases prediction accuracy by 0.67\%. Extensive experiments with real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the \textsf{ST-Mamba} model sets a new benchmark in traffic flow prediction, achieving SOTA performance in computational efficiency for both long- and short-range predictions and significantly improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness of traffic management.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |

Within the context of solar radiation, the changing climate may have an effect on photovoltaic (PV) production, especially as the PV industry moves to extend plant lifetimes to 50 years. Predicting PV production while taking into account a changing climate requires data at a resolution that is useful for building PV plants. Although temporal and spatial downscaling of solar radiation data is widely studied, we present a novel method to downscale solar radiation data from daily averages to hourly profiles, while maintaining spatial correlation of parameters characterizing the diurnal profile of solar radiation. The method focuses on the use of a diurnal template which can be shifted and scaled according to the time or year and location and the use of thin plate splines for spatial downscaling. This analysis is applied to data from the National Solar Radiation Database housed at the National Renewable Energy Lab and a case study of the mentioned methods over several sub-regions of continental United States is presented.</p></details> | 35 pages, 14 figures |
| **[How Can Large Language Models Understand Spatial-Temporal Data?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14192v2)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) dominate tasks like natural language processing and computer vision, harnessing their power for spatial-temporal forecasting remains challenging. The disparity between sequential text and complex spatial-temporal data hinders this application. To address this issue, this paper introduces STG-LLM, an innovative approach empowering LLMs for spatial-temporal forecasting. We tackle the data mismatch by proposing: 1) STG-Tokenizer: This spatial-temporal graph tokenizer transforms intricate graph data into concise tokens capturing both spatial and temporal relationships; 2) STG-Adapter: This minimalistic adapter, consisting of linear encoding and decoding layers, bridges the gap between tokenized data and LLM comprehension. By fine-tuning only a small set of parameters, it can effectively grasp the semantics of tokens generated by STG-Tokenizer, while preserving the original natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs. Extensive experiments on diverse spatial-temporal benchmark datasets show that STG-LLM successfully unlocks LLM potential for spatial-temporal forecasting. Remarkably, our approach achieves competitive performance on par with dedicated SOTA methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast and Scalable Inference for Spatial Extreme Value Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07051v3)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution is a popular model for analyzing and forecasting extreme weather data. To increase prediction accuracy, spatial information is often pooled via a latent Gaussian process (GP) on the GEV parameters. Inference for GEV-GP models is typically carried out using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, or using approximate inference methods such as the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA). However, MCMC becomes prohibitively slow as the number of spatial locations increases, whereas INLA is only applicable in practice to a limited subset of GEV-GP models. In this paper, we revisit the original Laplace approximation for fitting spatial GEV models. In combination with a popular sparsity-inducing spatial covariance approximation technique, we show through simulations that our approach accurately estimates the Bayesian predictive distribution of extreme weather events, is scalable to several thousand spatial locations, and is several orders of magnitude faster than MCMC. A case study in forecasting extreme snowfall across Canada is presented.</p></details> |  |
| **[Process-based Inference for Spatial Energetics Using Bayesian Predictive Stacking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09906v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid developments in streaming data technologies have enabled real-time monitoring of human activity that can deliver high-resolution data on health variables over trajectories or paths carved out by subjects as they conduct their daily physical activities. Wearable devices, such as wrist-worn sensors that monitor gross motor activity, have become prevalent and have kindled the emerging field of ``spatial energetics'' in environmental health sciences. We devise a Bayesian inferential framework for analyzing such data while accounting for information available on specific spatial coordinates comprising a trajectory or path using a Global Positioning System (GPS) device embedded within the wearable device. We offer full probabilistic inference with uncertainty quantification using spatial-temporal process models adapted for data generated from ``actigraph'' units as the subject traverses a path or trajectory in their daily routine. Anticipating the need for fast inference for mobile health data, we pursue exact inference using conjugate Bayesian models and employ predictive stacking to assimilate inference across these individual models. This circumvents issues with iterative estimation algorithms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo. We devise Bayesian predictive stacking in this context for models that treat time as discrete epochs and that treat time as continuous. We illustrate our methods with simulation experiments and analysis of data from the Physical Activity through Sustainable Transport Approaches (PASTA-LA) study conducted by the Fielding School of Public Health at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p></details> | 38 pages, 13 figures |

Traditional methods of post-facto image correction, essential for correcting these distortions, often rely on simplifying assumptions that limit their effectiveness, particularly in the presence of spatially variant atmospheric turbulence. Such cases are often solved by partitioning the field-of-view into small patches, deconvolving each patch independently, and merging all patches together. This approach is often inefficient and can produce artifacts. Recent advancements in computational techniques and the advent of deep learning offer new pathways to address these limitations. This paper introduces a novel framework leveraging a deep neural network to emulate spatially variant convolutions, offering a breakthrough in the efficiency and accuracy of astronomical image deconvolution. By training on a dataset of images convolved with spatially invariant point spread functions and validating its generalizability to spatially variant conditions, this approach presents a significant advancement over traditional methods. The convolution emulator is used as a forward model in a multi-object multi-frame blind deconvolution algorithm for solar images. The emulator enables the deconvolution of solar observations across large fields of view without resorting to patch-wise mosaicking, thus avoiding artifacts associated with such techniques. This method represents a significant computational advantage, reducing processing times by orders of magnitude.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 14 figures, accepted for publication in A&A</p></details> |
| **[Temporal-Spatial Object Relations Modeling for Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15691v2)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a challenging task where an agent is required to navigate to a natural language described location via vision observations. The navigation abilities of the agent can be enhanced by the relations between objects, which are usually learned using internal objects or external datasets. The relationships between internal objects are modeled employing graph convolutional network (GCN) in traditional studies. However, GCN tends to be shallow, limiting its modeling ability. To address this issue, we utilize a cross attention mechanism to learn the connections between objects over a trajectory, which takes temporal continuity into account, termed as Temporal Object Relations (TOR). The external datasets have a gap with the navigation environment, leading to inaccurate modeling of relations. To avoid this problem, we construct object connections based on observations from all viewpoints in the navigational environment, which ensures complete spatial coverage and eliminates the gap, called Spatial Object Relations (SOR). Additionally, we observe that agents may repeatedly visit the same location during navigation, significantly hindering their performance. For resolving this matter, we introduce the Turning Back Penalty (TBP) loss function, which penalizes the agent's repetitive visiting behavior, substantially reducing the navigational distance. Experimental results on the REVERIE, SOON, and R2R datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

The current goal of rough set attribute reduction focuses more on minimizing the number of reduced attributes, but ignores the spatial similarity between reduced and decision attributes, which may lead to problems such as increased number of rules and limited generality. In this paper, a rough set attribute reduction algorithm based on spatial optimization is proposed. By introducing the concept of spatial similarity, to find the reduction with the highest spatial similarity, so that the spatial similarity between reduction and decision attributes is higher, and more concise and widespread rules are obtained. In addition, a comparative experiment with the traditional rough set attribute reduction algorithms is designed to prove the effectiveness of the rough set attribute reduction algorithm based on spatial optimization, which has made significant improvements on many datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

With the advancements in RNNs, CNNs, and other non-generative techniques, researchers have explored their application in capturing temporal and spatial dependencies within spatial-temporal data. However, the emergence of generative techniques such as LLMs, SSL, Seq2Seq and diffusion models has opened up new possibilities for enhancing spatial-temporal data mining further. The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of generative technique-based spatial-temporal methods and introduces a standardized framework specifically designed for the spatial-temporal data mining pipeline. By offering a detailed review and a novel taxonomy of spatial-temporal methodology utilizing generative techniques, the paper enables a deeper understanding of the various techniques employed in this field. Furthermore, the paper highlights promising future research directions, urging researchers to delve deeper into spatial-temporal data mining. It emphasizes the need to explore untapped opportunities and push the boundaries of knowledge to unlock new insights and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of spatial-temporal data mining. By integrating generative techniques and providing a standardized framework, the paper contributes to advancing the field and encourages researchers to explore the vast potential of generative techniques in spatial-temporal data mining.</p></details> | 19 pages |

Existing approaches often rely on layout remapping tools, which may not guarantee optimal conversion from a psychoacoustic perspective. To overcome these challenges, we present the Universal Spatial Audio Transcoder (USAT) method and its corresponding open source implementation. USAT generates an optimal decoder or transcoder for any input spatial audio format, adapting it to any output format or 2D/3D loudspeaker configuration. Drawing upon optimization techniques based on psychoacoustic principles, the algorithm maximizes the preservation of spatial information. We present examples of the decoding and transcoding of several audio formats, and show that USAT approach is advantageous compared to the most common methods in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Spatial Semantic Recurrent Mining for Referring Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09006v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) consistently requires language and appearance semantics to more understand each other. The need becomes acute especially under hard situations. To achieve, existing works tend to resort to various trans-representing mechanisms to directly feed forward language semantic along main RGB branch, which however will result in referent distribution weakly-mined in space and non-referent semantic contaminated along channel. In this paper, we propose Spatial Semantic Recurrent Mining (S\textsuperscript{2}RM) to achieve high-quality cross-modality fusion. It follows a working strategy of trilogy: distributing language feature, spatial semantic recurrent coparsing, and parsed-semantic balancing. During fusion, S\textsuperscript{2}RM will first generate a constraint-weak yet distribution-aware language feature, then bundle features of each row and column from rotated features of one modality context to recurrently correlate relevant semantic contained in feature from other modality context, and finally resort to self-distilled weights to weigh on the contributions of different parsed semantics. Via coparsing, S\textsuperscript{2}RM transports information from the near and remote slice layers of generator context to the current slice layer of parsed context, capable of better modeling global relationship bidirectional and structured. Besides, we also propose a Cross-scale Abstract Semantic Guided Decoder (CASG) to emphasize the foreground of the referent, finally integrating different grained features at a comparatively low cost. Extensive experimental results on four current challenging datasets show that our proposed method performs favorably against other state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[TAnet: A New Temporal Attention Network for EEG-based Auditory Spatial Attention Decoding with a Short Decision Window](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05819v2)** | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auditory spatial attention detection (ASAD) is used to determine the direction of a listener's attention to a speaker by analyzing her/his electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. This study aimed to further improve the performance of ASAD with a short decision window (i.e., <1 s) rather than with long decision windows ranging from 1 to 5 seconds in previous studies. An end-to-end temporal attention network (i.e., TAnet) was introduced in this work. TAnet employs a multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism, which can more effectively capture the interactions among time steps in collected EEG signals and efficiently assign corresponding weights to those EEG time steps. Experiments demonstrated that, compared with the CNN-based method and recent ASAD methods, TAnet provided improved decoding performance in the KUL dataset, with decoding accuracies of 92.4% (decision window 0.1 s), 94.9% (0.25 s), 95.1% (0.3 s), 95.4% (0.4 s), and 95.5% (0.5 s) with short decision windows (i.e., <1 s). As a new ASAD model with a short decision window, TAnet can potentially facilitate the design of EEG-controlled intelligent hearing aids and sound recognition systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guided Interpretable Facial Expression Recognition via Spatial Action Unit Cues](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00281v5)** | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although state-of-the-art classifiers for facial expression recognition (FER) can achieve a high level of accuracy, they lack interpretability, an important feature for end-users. Experts typically associate spatial action units (\aus) from a codebook to facial regions for the visual interpretation of expressions. In this paper, the same expert steps are followed. A new learning strategy is proposed to explicitly incorporate \au cues into classifier training, allowing to train deep interpretable models. During training, this \au codebook is used, along with the input image expression label, and facial landmarks, to construct a \au heatmap that indicates the most discriminative image regions of interest w.r.t the facial expression. This valuable spatial cue is leveraged to train a deep interpretable classifier for FER. This is achieved by constraining the spatial layer features of a classifier to be correlated with \au heatmaps. Using a composite loss, the classifier is trained to correctly classify an image while yielding interpretable visual layer-wise attention correlated with \au maps, simulating the expert decision process. Our strategy only relies on image class expression for supervision, without additional manual annotations. Our new strategy is generic, and can be applied to any deep CNN- or transformer-based classifier without requiring any architectural change or significant additional training time. Our extensive evaluation on two public benchmarks \rafdb, and \affectnet datasets shows that our proposed strategy can improve layer-wise interpretability without degrading classification performance. In addition, we explore a common type of interpretable classifiers that rely on class activation mapping (CAM) methods, and show that our approach can also improve CAM interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables, International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG 2024)</p></details> |

Most previous works attempt to explore more additional information and adopt attention mechanisms for improving 3D reconstruction performance, while it would increase computational complexity simultaneously. To achieve a performance-reserving architecture with high computational efficiency, in this work, we propose a simple but effective 3D hand mesh reconstruction network (i.e., HandS3C), which is the first time to incorporate state space model into the task of hand mesh reconstruction. In the network, we design a novel state-space spatial-channel attention module that extends the effective receptive field, extracts hand features in the spatial dimension, and enhances regional features of hands in the channel dimension. This helps to reconstruct a complete and detailed hand mesh. Extensive experiments conducted on well-known datasets facing heavy occlusions (such as FREIHAND, DEXYCB, and HO3D) demonstrate that our proposed HandS3C achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a minimal parameters.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Estimating Direct and Indirect Causal Effects of Spatiotemporal Interventions in Presence of Spatial Interference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08174v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial interference (SI) occurs when the treatment at one location affects the outcomes at other locations. Accounting for spatial interference in spatiotemporal settings poses further challenges as interference violates the stable unit treatment value assumption, making it infeasible for standard causal inference methods to quantify the effects of time-varying treatment at spatially varying outcomes. In this paper, we first formalize the concept of spatial interference in case of time-varying treatment assignments by extending the potential outcome framework under the assumption of no unmeasured confounding. We then propose our deep learning based potential outcome model for spatiotemporal causal inference. We utilize latent factor modeling to reduce the bias due to time-varying confounding while leveraging the power of U-Net architecture to capture global and local spatial interference in data over time. Our causal estimators are an extension of average treatment effect (ATE) for estimating direct (DATE) and indirect effects (IATE) of spatial interference on treated and untreated data. Being the first of its kind deep learning based spatiotemporal causal inference technique, our approach shows advantages over several baseline methods based on the experiment results on two synthetic datasets, with and without spatial interference. Our results on real-world climate dataset also align with domain knowledge, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

These methods seek to estimate abundance while accounting for multiple complexities found in ecological data, such as observational biases, spatial autocorrelation, and species correlations. There is, however, a lack of user-friendly and computationally efficient software to implement the various models, particularly for large data sets. We developed the spAbundance R package for fitting spatially-explicit Bayesian single-species and multi-species hierarchical distance sampling models, N-mixture models, and generalized linear mixed models. The models within the package can account for spatial autocorrelation using Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Processes and accommodate species correlations in multi-species models using a latent factor approach, which enables model fitting for data sets with large numbers of sites and/or species. We provide three vignettes and three case studies that highlight spAbundance functionality. We used spatially-explicit multi-species distance sampling models to estimate density of 16 bird species in Florida, USA, an N-mixture model to estimate Black-throated Blue Warbler (Setophaga caerulescens) abundance in New Hampshire, USA, and a spatial linear mixed model to estimate forest aboveground biomass across the continental USA. spAbundance provides a user-friendly, formula-based interface to fit a variety of univariate and multivariate spatially-explicit abundance models. The package serves as a useful tool for ecologists and conservation practitioners to generate improved inference and predictions on the spatial drivers of populations and communities.</p></details> |  |

Yet, such models are prone to errors which can have serious safety implications. Introspection and self-assessment models that aim to detect such errors are therefore of paramount importance for the safe deployment of ADS. Current research on this topic has focused on techniques to monitor the integrity of the perception mechanism in ADS. Existing introspection models in the literature, however, largely concentrate on detecting perception errors by assigning equal importance to all parts of the input data frame to the perception module. This generic approach overlooks the varying safety significance of different objects within a scene, which obscures the recognition of safety-critical errors, posing challenges in assessing the reliability of perception in specific, crucial instances. Motivated by this shortcoming of state of the art, this paper proposes a novel method integrating raw activation patterns of the underlying DNNs, employed by the perception module, analysis with spatial filtering techniques. This novel approach enhances the accuracy of runtime introspection of the DNN-based 3D object detections by selectively focusing on an area of interest in the data, thereby contributing to the safety and efficacy of ADS perception self-assessment processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ITSC 2024. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2404.07685</p></details> |

However, current attention paradigms fail to infer an optimal channel descriptor capable of simultaneously exploiting statistical and spatial relationships among feature maps. In this paper, to overcome this shortcoming, we present a novel channel-wise spatially autocorrelated (CSA) attention mechanism. Inspired by geographical analysis, the proposed CSA exploits the spatial relationships between channels of feature maps to produce an effective channel descriptor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the f irst time that the concept of geographical spatial analysis is utilized in deep CNNs. The proposed CSA imposes negligible learning parameters and light computational overhead to the deep model, making it a powerful yet efficient attention module of choice. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed CSA networks (CSA-Nets) through extensive experiments and analysis on ImageNet, and MS COCO benchmark datasets for image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation. The experimental results demonstrate that CSA-Nets are able to consistently achieve competitive performance and superior generalization than several state-of-the-art attention-based CNNs over different benchmark tasks and datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, the pursuit of accuracy in current studies leads to large, long-timestep SNNs, conflicting with the resource constraints of these devices. In order to design lightweight and efficient SNNs, we propose a new approach named LitE-SNN that incorporates both spatial and temporal compression into the automated network design process. Spatially, we present a novel Compressive Convolution block (CompConv) to expand the search space to support pruning and mixed-precision quantization. Temporally, we are the first to propose a compressive timestep search to identify the optimal number of timesteps under specific computation cost constraints. Finally, we formulate a joint optimization to simultaneously learn the architecture parameters and spatial-temporal compression strategies to achieve high performance while minimizing memory and computation costs. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Google Speech Command datasets demonstrate our proposed LitE-SNNs can achieve competitive or even higher accuracy with remarkably smaller model sizes and fewer computation costs.</p></details> |  |

Intersectoral GDP contributions reveal the economic development of different sectors of the national economy. Linking intersectoral GDP contributions to Gini coefficients will provide better understandings of how the Gini coefficient is influenced by different industries. In this paper, a compositional regression with spatially clustered coefficients is proposed to explore heterogeneous effects over spatial locations under nonparametric Bayesian framework. Specifically, a Markov random field constraint mixture of finite mixtures prior is designed for Bayesian log contrast regression with compostional covariates, which allows for both spatially contiguous clusters and discontinous clusters. In addition, an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior sampling that enables simultaneous inference on both cluster configurations and cluster-wise parameters is designed. The compelling empirical performance of the proposed method is demonstrated via extensive simulation studies and an application to 51 states of United States from 2019 Bureau of Economic Analysis.</p></details> |  |

Zero inflation, spatial dependence, and non-equidispersion are common features in count data. There are two classes of models that allow for these features -- he mode-parameterized Conway--Maxwell--Poisson (COMP) distribution and the generalized Poisson model. However both require the use of either constraints on the parameter space or a parameterization that leads to challenges in interpretability. We propose a spatial mean-parameterized COMP model that retains the flexibility of these models while resolving the above issues. We use a Bayesian spatial filtering approach in order to efficiently handle high-dimensional spatial data and we use reversible-jump MCMC to automatically choose the basis vectors for spatial filtering. The COMP distribution poses two additional computational challenges -- an intractable normalizing function in the likelihood and no closed-form expression for the mean. We propose a fast computational approach that addresses these challenges by, respectively, introducing an efficient auxiliary variable algorithm and pre-computing key approximations for fast likelihood evaluation. We illustrate the application of our methodology to simulated and real datasets, including Texas HPV-cancer data and US vaccine refusal data.</p></details> |  |

These drivers impact the trajectory of evolution, and have been hypothesized to influence phylogenetic structure. Here, we set out to assess (1) if spatial structure, ecology, and selection pressure leave detectable signatures in phylogenetic structure, (2) the extent, in particular, to which ecology can be detected and discerned in the presence of spatial structure, and (3) the extent to which these phylogenetic signatures generalize across evolutionary systems. To this end, we analyze phylogenies generated by manipulating spatial structure, ecology, and selection pressure within three computational models of varied scope and sophistication. We find that selection pressure, spatial structure, and ecology have characteristic effects on phylogenetic metrics, although these effects are complex and not always intuitive. Signatures have some consistency across systems when using equivalent taxonomic unit definitions (e.g., individual, genotype, species). Further, we find that sufficiently strong ecology can be detected in the presence of spatial structure. We also find that, while low-resolution phylogenetic reconstructions can bias some phylogenetic metrics, high-resolution reconstructions recapitulate them faithfully. Although our results suggest potential for evolutionary inference of spatial structure, ecology, and selection pressure through phylogenetic analysis, further methods development is needed to distinguish these drivers' phylometric signatures from each other and to appropriately normalize phylogenetic metrics. With such work, phylogenetic analysis could provide a versatile toolkit to study large-scale evolving populations.</p></details> |  |

The work also introduces a publicly available dataset of imagery, building polygons, and human-generated and curated adjustments that can be used to evaluate existing strategies for aligning building polygons with sUAS imagery. There are no efforts that have aligned pre-existing spatial data with sUAS imagery, and thus, there is no clear state of practice. However, this effort and analysis show that the translational alignment errors present in this type of data, averaging 82px and an intersection over the union of 0.65, which would induce further errors and biases in downstream machine learning systems unless addressed. This study identifies and analyzes the translational alignment errors of 21,619 building polygons in fifty-one orthomosaic images, covering 16787.2 Acres (26.23 square miles), constructed from sUAS raw imagery from nine wide-area disasters (Hurricane Ian, Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Michael, Hurricane Ida, Hurricane Idalia, Hurricane Laura, the Mayfield Tornado, the Musset Bayou Fire, and the Kilauea Eruption). The analysis finds no uniformity among the angle and distance metrics of the building polygon alignments as they present an average degree variance of 0.4 and an average pixel distance variance of 0.45. This work alerts the sUAS community to the problem of spatial alignment and that a simple linear transform, often used to align satellite imagery, will not be sufficient to align spatial data in sUAS orthomosaic imagery.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

| **[STELLA: Continual Audio-Video Pre-training with Spatio-Temporal Localized Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08204v3)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuously learning a variety of audio-video semantics over time is crucial for audio-related reasoning tasks in our ever-evolving world. However, this is a nontrivial problem and poses two critical challenges: sparse spatio-temporal correlation between audio-video pairs and multimodal correlation overwriting that forgets audio-video relations. To tackle this problem, we propose a new continual audio-video pre-training method with two novel ideas: (1) Localized Patch Importance Scoring: we introduce a multimodal encoder to determine the importance score for each patch, emphasizing semantically intertwined audio-video patches. (2) Replay-guided Correlation Assessment: to reduce the corruption of previously learned audiovisual knowledge due to drift, we propose to assess the correlation of the current patches on the past steps to identify the patches exhibiting high correlations with the past steps. Based on the results from the two ideas, we perform probabilistic patch selection for effective continual audio-video pre-training. Experimental validation on multiple benchmarks shows that our method achieves a 3.69%p of relative performance gain in zero-shot retrieval tasks compared to strong continual learning baselines, while reducing memory consumption by ~45%.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |
| **[SAMSGL: Series-Aligned Multi-Scale Graph Learning for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02646v3)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting in various domains, like traffic prediction and weather forecasting, is a challenging endeavor, primarily due to the difficulties in modeling propagation dynamics and capturing high-dimensional interactions among nodes. Despite the significant strides made by graph-based networks in spatio-temporal forecasting, there remain two pivotal factors closely related to forecasting performance that need further consideration: time delays in propagation dynamics and multi-scale high-dimensional interactions. In this work, we present a Series-Aligned Multi-Scale Graph Learning (SAMSGL) framework, aiming to enhance forecasting performance. In order to handle time delays in spatial interactions, we propose a series-aligned graph convolution layer to facilitate the aggregation of non-delayed graph signals, thereby mitigating the influence of time delays for the improvement in accuracy. To understand global and local spatio-temporal interactions, we develop a spatio-temporal architecture via multi-scale graph learning, which encompasses two essential components: multi-scale graph structure learning and graph-fully connected (Graph-FC) blocks. The multi-scale graph structure learning includes a global graph structure to learn both delayed and non-delayed node embeddings, as well as a local one to learn node variations influenced by neighboring factors. The Graph-FC blocks synergistically fuse spatial and temporal information to boost prediction accuracy. To evaluate the performance of SAMSGL, we conduct experiments on meteorological and traffic forecasting datasets, which demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority.</p></details> | Accepted by Chaos |
| **[Hidden Markov modelling of spatio-temporal dynamics of measles in 1750-1850 Finland](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16885v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real world spatio-temporal datasets, and phenomena related to them, are often challenging to visualise or gain a general overview of. In order to summarise information encompassed in such data, we combine two well known statistical modelling methods. To account for the spatial dimension, we use the intrinsic modification of the conditional autoregression, and incorporate it with the hidden Markov model, allowing the spatial patterns to vary over time. We apply our method into parish register data considering deaths caused by measles in Finland in 1750-1850, and gain novel insight of previously undiscovered infection dynamics. Five distinctive, reoccurring states describing spatially and temporally differing infection burden and potential routes of spread are identified. We also find that there is a change in the occurrences of the most typical spatial patterns circa 1812, possibly due to changes in communication routes after major administrative transformations in Finland.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graphon Particle Systems, Part I: Spatio-Temporal Approximation and Law of Large Numbers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16760v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a class of graphon particle systems with time-varying random coefficients. In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from the stochastic processes associated with the particle labels. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over the large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the dynamic evolution of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Sustainable Urban Mobility Prediction with Telecom Data: A Spatio-Temporal Framework Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17507v1)** | 2024-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional traffic prediction, limited by the scope of sensor data, falls short in comprehensive traffic management. Mobile networks offer a promising alternative using network activity counts, but these lack crucial directionality. Thus, we present the TeltoMob dataset, featuring undirected telecom counts and corresponding directional flows, to predict directional mobility flows on roadways. To address this, we propose a two-stage spatio-temporal graph neural network (STGNN) framework. The first stage uses a pre-trained STGNN to process telecom data, while the second stage integrates directional and geographic insights for accurate prediction. Our experiments demonstrate the framework's compatibility with various STGNN models and confirm its effectiveness. We also show how to incorporate the framework into real-world transportation systems, enhancing sustainable urban mobility.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 Fig...</summary><p>8 Figures, 5 Tables.

| **[On the PM2.5 -- Mortality Relationship: A Bayesian Dynamic Model for Spatio-Temporal Confounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16106v1)** | 2024-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial confounding, often regarded as a major concern in epidemiological studies, relates to the difficulty of recovering the effect of an exposure on an outcome when these variables are associated with unobserved factors. This issue is particularly challenging in spatio-temporal analyses, where it has been less explored so far. To study the effects of air pollution on mortality in Italy, we argue that a model that simultaneously accounts for spatio-temporal confounding and for the non-linear form of the effect of interest is needed. To this end, we propose a Bayesian dynamic generalized linear model, which allows for a non-linear association and for a decomposition of the exposure effect into two components. This decomposition accommodates associations with the outcome at fine and coarse temporal and spatial scales of variation. These features, when combined, allow reducing the spatio-temporal confounding bias and recovering the true shape of the association, as demonstrated through simulation studies. The results from the real-data application indicate that the exposure effect seems to have different magnitudes in different seasons, with peaks in the summer. We hypothesize that this could be due to possible interactions between the exposure variable with air temperature and unmeasured confounders.</p></details> | 40 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Nonparametric quantile regression for spatio-temporal processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13783v2)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we develop a new and effective approach to nonparametric quantile regression that accommodates ultrahigh-dimensional data arising from spatio-temporal processes. This approach proves advantageous in staving off computational challenges that constitute known hindrances to existing nonparametric quantile regression methods when the number of predictors is much larger than the available sample size. We investigate conditions under which estimation is feasible and of good overall quality and obtain sharp approximations that we employ to devising statistical inference methodology. These include simultaneous confidence intervals and tests of hypotheses, whose asymptotics is borne by a non-trivial functional central limit theorem tailored to martingale differences. Additionally, we provide finite-sample results through various simulations which, accompanied by an illustrative application to real-worldesque data (on electricity demand), offer guarantees on the performance of the proposed methodology.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 2 figures and accompanying supplementary documentation</p></details> |
| **[STC-ViT: Spatio Temporal Continuous Vision Transformer for Weather Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17966v2)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Operational weather forecasting system relies on computationally expensive physics-based models. Recently, transformer based models have shown remarkable potential in weather forecasting achieving state-of-the-art results. However, transformers are discrete models which limit their ability to learn the continuous spatio-temporal features of the dynamical weather system. We address this issue with STC-ViT, a Spatio-Temporal Continuous Vision Transformer for weather forecasting. STC-ViT incorporates the continuous time Neural ODE layers with multi-head attention mechanism to learn the continuous weather evolution over time. The attention mechanism is encoded as a differentiable function in the transformer architecture to model the complex weather dynamics. We evaluate STC-ViT against a operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model and several deep learning based weather forecasting models. STC-ViT performs competitively with current data-driven methods in global forecasting while only being trained at lower resolution data and with less compute power.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniST: A Prompt-Empowered Universal Model for Urban Spatio-Temporal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11838v3)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban spatio-temporal prediction is crucial for informed decision-making, such as transportation management, resource optimization, and urban planning. Although pretrained foundation models for natural languages have experienced remarkable breakthroughs, wherein one general-purpose model can tackle multiple tasks across various domains, urban spatio-temporal modeling lags behind. Existing approaches for urban prediction are usually tailored for specific spatio-temporal scenarios, requiring task-specific model designs and extensive in-domain training data. In this work, we propose a universal model, UniST, for urban spatio-temporal prediction. Drawing inspiration from large language models, UniST achieves success through: (i) flexibility towards diverse spatio-temporal data characteristics, (ii) effective generative pre-training with elaborated masking strategies to capture complex spatio-temporal relationships, (iii) spatio-temporal knowledge-guided prompts that align and leverage intrinsic and shared knowledge across scenarios. These designs together unlock the potential of a one-for-all model for spatio-temporal prediction with powerful generalization capability. Extensive experiments on 15 cities and 6 domains demonstrate the universality of UniST in advancing state-of-the-art prediction performance, especially in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios. The implementation is available at this repository: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/UniST.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretable Spatio-Temporal Embedding for Brain Structural-Effective Network with Ordinary Differential Equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13190v1)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The MRI-derived brain network serves as a pivotal instrument in elucidating both the structural and functional aspects of the brain, encompassing the ramifications of diseases and developmental processes. However, prevailing methodologies, often focusing on synchronous BOLD signals from functional MRI (fMRI), may not capture directional influences among brain regions and rarely tackle temporal functional dynamics. In this study, we first construct the brain-effective network via the dynamic causal model. Subsequently, we introduce an interpretable graph learning framework termed Spatio-Temporal Embedding ODE (STE-ODE). This framework incorporates specifically designed directed node embedding layers, aiming at capturing the dynamic interplay between structural and effective networks via an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model, which characterizes spatial-temporal brain dynamics. Our framework is validated on several clinical phenotype prediction tasks using two independent publicly available datasets (HCP and OASIS). The experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantages of our model compared to several state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equivariant Spatio-Temporal Attentive Graph Networks to Simulate Physical Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12868v1)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning to represent and simulate the dynamics of physical systems is a crucial yet challenging task. Existing equivariant Graph Neural Network (GNN) based methods have encapsulated the symmetry of physics, \emph{e.g.}, translations, rotations, etc, leading to better generalization ability. Nevertheless, their frame-to-frame formulation of the task overlooks the non-Markov property mainly incurred by unobserved dynamics in the environment. In this paper, we reformulate dynamics simulation as a spatio-temporal prediction task, by employing the trajectory in the past period to recover the Non-Markovian interactions. We propose Equivariant Spatio-Temporal Attentive Graph Networks (ESTAG), an equivariant version of spatio-temporal GNNs, to fulfill our purpose. At its core, we design a novel Equivariant Discrete Fourier Transform (EDFT) to extract periodic patterns from the history frames, and then construct an Equivariant Spatial Module (ESM) to accomplish spatial message passing, and an Equivariant Temporal Module (ETM) with the forward attention and equivariant pooling mechanisms to aggregate temporal message. We evaluate our model on three real datasets corresponding to the molecular-, protein- and macro-level. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of ESTAG compared to typical spatio-temporal GNNs and equivariant GNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been published to the conference of NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |
| **[Prompt-Enhanced Spatio-Temporal Graph Transfer Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12452v1)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal graph neural networks have demonstrated efficacy in capturing complex dependencies for urban computing tasks such as forecasting and kriging. However, their performance is constrained by the reliance on extensive data for training on specific tasks, which limits their adaptability to new urban domains with varied demands. Although transfer learning has been proposed to address this problem by leveraging knowledge across domains, cross-task generalization remains underexplored in spatio-temporal graph transfer learning methods due to the absence of a unified framework. To bridge this gap, we propose Spatio-Temporal Graph Prompting (STGP), a prompt-enhanced transfer learning framework capable of adapting to diverse tasks in data-scarce domains. Specifically, we first unify different tasks into a single template and introduce a task-agnostic network architecture that aligns with this template. This approach enables the capture of spatio-temporal dependencies shared across tasks. Furthermore, we employ learnable prompts to achieve domain and task transfer in a two-stage prompting pipeline, enabling the prompts to effectively capture domain knowledge and task-specific properties at each stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STGP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in three downstream tasks forecasting, kriging, and extrapolation by a notable margin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal Attention-based Hidden Physics-informed Neural Network for Remaining Useful Life Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12377v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is essential in Prognostic Health Management (PHM) for industrial systems. Although deep learning approaches have achieved considerable success in predicting RUL, challenges such as low prediction accuracy and interpretability pose significant challenges, hindering their practical implementation. In this work, we introduce a Spatio-temporal Attention-based Hidden Physics-informed Neural Network (STA-HPINN) for RUL prediction, which can utilize the associated physics of the system degradation. The spatio-temporal attention mechanism can extract important features from the input data. With the self-attention mechanism on both the sensor dimension and time step dimension, the proposed model can effectively extract degradation information. The hidden physics-informed neural network is utilized to capture the physics mechanisms that govern the evolution of RUL. With the constraint of physics, the model can achieve higher accuracy and reasonable predictions. The approach is validated on a benchmark dataset, demonstrating exceptional performance when compared to cutting-edge methods, especially in the case of complex conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal modeling of co-dynamics of smallpox, measles and pertussis in pre-healthcare Finland](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06538v2)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infections are known to interact as previous infections may have an effect on risk of succumbing to a new infection. The co-dynamics can be mediated by immunosuppression or -modulation, shared environmental or climatic drivers, or competition for susceptible hosts. Research and statistical methods in epidemiology often concentrate on large pooled datasets, or high quality data from cities, leaving rural areas underrepresented in literature. Data considering rural populations are typically sparse and scarce, especially in the case of historical data sources, which may introduce considerable methodological challenges. In order to overcome many obstacles due to such data, we present a general Bayesian spatio-temporal model for disease co-dynamics. Applying the proposed model on historical (1820-1850) Finnish parish register data, we study the spread of infectious diseases in pre-healthcare Finland. We observe that measles, pertussis, and smallpox exhibit positively correlated dynamics, which could be attributed to immunosuppressive effects or, for example, the general weakening of the population due to recurring infections or poor nutritional conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Khronos: A Unified Approach for Spatio-Temporal Metric-Semantic SLAM in Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13817v2)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perceiving and understanding highly dynamic and changing environments is a crucial capability for robot autonomy. While large strides have been made towards developing dynamic SLAM approaches that estimate the robot pose accurately, a lesser emphasis has been put on the construction of dense spatio-temporal representations of the robot environment. A detailed understanding of the scene and its evolution through time is crucial for long-term robot autonomy and essential to tasks that require long-term reasoning, such as operating effectively in environments shared with humans and other agents and thus are subject to short and long-term dynamics. To address this challenge, this work defines the Spatio-temporal Metric-semantic SLAM (SMS) problem, and presents a framework to factorize and solve it efficiently. We show that the proposed factorization suggests a natural organization of a spatio-temporal perception system, where a fast process tracks short-term dynamics in an active temporal window, while a slower process reasons over long-term changes in the environment using a factor graph formulation. We provide an efficient implementation of the proposed spatio-temporal perception approach, that we call Khronos, and show that it unifies exiting interpretations of short-term and long-term dynamics and is able to construct a dense spatio-temporal map in real-time. We provide simulated and real results, showing that the spatio-temporal maps built by Khronos are an accurate reflection of a 3D scene over time and that Khronos outperforms baselines across multiple metrics. We further validate our approach on two heterogeneous robots in challenging, large-scale real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics: Science and Systems, 2024.

| **[UrbanGPT: Spatio-Temporal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00813v3)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal prediction aims to forecast and gain insights into the ever-changing dynamics of urban environments across both time and space. Its purpose is to anticipate future patterns, trends, and events in diverse facets of urban life, including transportation, population movement, and crime rates. Although numerous efforts have been dedicated to developing neural network techniques for accurate predictions on spatio-temporal data, it is important to note that many of these methods heavily depend on having sufficient labeled data to generate precise spatio-temporal representations. Unfortunately, the issue of data scarcity is pervasive in practical urban sensing scenarios. Consequently, it becomes necessary to build a spatio-temporal model with strong generalization capabilities across diverse spatio-temporal learning scenarios. Taking inspiration from the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs), our objective is to create a spatio-temporal LLM that can exhibit exceptional generalization capabilities across a wide range of downstream urban tasks. To achieve this objective, we present the UrbanGPT, which seamlessly integrates a spatio-temporal dependency encoder with the instruction-tuning paradigm. This integration enables LLMs to comprehend the complex inter-dependencies across time and space, facilitating more comprehensive and accurate predictions under data scarcity. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on various public datasets, covering different spatio-temporal prediction tasks. The results consistently demonstrate that our UrbanGPT, with its carefully designed architecture, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These findings highlight the potential of building large language models for spatio-temporal learning, particularly in zero-shot scenarios where labeled data is scarce.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD'2024 as Full Paper</p></details> |
| **[Open-Vocabulary Spatio-Temporal Action Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10832v1)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal action detection (STAD) is an important fine-grained video understanding task. Current methods require box and label supervision for all action classes in advance. However, in real-world applications, it is very likely to come across new action classes not seen in training because the action category space is large and hard to enumerate. Also, the cost of data annotation and model training for new classes is extremely high for traditional methods, as we need to perform detailed box annotations and re-train the whole network from scratch. In this paper, we propose a new challenging setting by performing open-vocabulary STAD to better mimic the situation of action detection in an open world. Open-vocabulary spatio-temporal action detection (OV-STAD) requires training a model on a limited set of base classes with box and label supervision, which is expected to yield good generalization performance on novel action classes. For OV-STAD, we build two benchmarks based on the existing STAD datasets and propose a simple but effective method based on pretrained video-language models (VLM). To better adapt the holistic VLM for the fine-grained action detection task, we carefully fine-tune it on the localized video region-text pairs. This customized fine-tuning endows the VLM with better motion understanding, thus contributing to a more accurate alignment between video regions and texts. Local region feature and global video feature fusion before alignment is adopted to further improve the action detection performance by providing global context. Our method achieves a promising performance on novel classes.</p></details> |  |

In the 1990s, the US EPA enacted the reformulated gasoline program in select areas of the US, which drastically reduced ambient TRAP in affected areas. This created an ideal quasi-experiment to study the effects of TRAP on childhood hematologic cancers. However, existing methods for quasi-experimental analyses can perform poorly when outcomes are rare and unstable, as with childhood cancer incidence. We develop Bayesian spatio-temporal matrix completion methods to conduct causal inference in quasi-experimental settings with rare outcomes. Selective information sharing across space and time enables stable estimation, and the Bayesian approach facilitates uncertainty quantification. We evaluate the methods through simulations and apply them to estimate the causal effects of TRAP on childhood leukemia and lymphoma.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Tidy Framework and Infrastructure to Systematically Assemble Spatio-temporal Indexes from Multivariate Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05812v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Indexes are useful for summarizing multivariate information into single metrics for monitoring, communicating, and decision-making. While most work has focused on defining new indexes for specific purposes, more attention needs to be directed towards making it possible to understand index behavior in different data conditions, and to determine how their structure affects their values and variation in values. Here we discuss a modular data pipeline recommendation to assemble indexes. It is universally applicable to index computation and allows investigation of index behavior as part of the development procedure. One can compute indexes with different parameter choices, adjust steps in the index definition by adding, removing, and swapping them to experiment with various index designs, calculate uncertainty measures, and assess indexes robustness. The paper presents three examples to illustrate the pipeline framework usage: comparison of two different indexes designed to monitor the spatio-temporal distribution of drought in Queensland, Australia; the effect of dimension reduction choices on the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) on countries ranking; and how to calculate bootstrap confidence intervals for the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The methods are supported by a new R package, called tidyindex.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fighter flight trajectory prediction based on spatio-temporal graphcial attention network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08034v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quickly and accurately predicting the flight trajectory of a blue army fighter in close-range air combat helps a red army fighter gain a dominant situation, which is the winning factor in later air combat. However,due to the high speed and even hypersonic capabilities of advanced fighters, the diversity of tactical maneuvers,and the instantaneous nature of situational transitions,it is difficult to meet the requirements of practical combat applications in terms of prediction accuracy.To improve prediction accuracy,this paper proposes a spatio-temporal graph attention network (ST-GAT) using encoding and decoding structures to predict the flight trajectory. The encoder adopts a parallel structure of Transformer and GAT branches embedded with the multi-head self-attention mechanism in each front end. The Transformer branch network is used to extract the temporal characteristics of historical trajectories and capture the impact of the fighter's historical state on future trajectories, while the GAT branch network is used to extract spatial features in historical trajectories and capture potential spatial correlations between fighters.Then we concatenate the outputs of the two branches into a new feature vector and input it into a decoder composed of a fully connected network to predict the future position coordinates of the blue army fighter.The computer simulation results show that the proposed network significantly improves the prediction accuracy of flight trajectories compared to the enhanced CNN-LSTM network (ECNN-LSTM), with improvements of 47% and 34% in both ADE and FDE indicators,providing strong support for subsequent autonomous combat missions.</p></details> |  |

They support the integration of renewables to the grid through improved grid stability and operation efficiency. Monitoring the health of transformers is essential to ensure grid reliability and efficiency. Thermal insulation ageing is a key transformer failure mode, which is generally tracked by monitoring the hotspot temperature (HST). However, HST measurement is complex and expensive and often estimated from indirect measurements. Existing computationally-efficient HST models focus on space-agnostic thermal models, providing worst-case HST estimates. This article introduces an efficient spatio-temporal model for transformer winding temperature and ageing estimation, which leverages physics-based partial differential equations (PDEs) with data-driven Neural Networks (NN) in a Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) configuration to improve prediction accuracy and acquire spatio-temporal resolution. The computational efficiency of the PINN model is improved through the implementation of the Residual-Based Attention scheme that accelerates the PINN model convergence. PINN based oil temperature predictions are used to estimate spatio-temporal transformer winding temperature values, which are validated through PDE resolution models and fiber optic sensor measurements, respectively. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal transformer ageing model is inferred, aiding transformer health management decision-making and providing insights into localized thermal ageing phenomena in the transformer insulation. Results are validated with a distribution transformer operated on a floating photovoltaic power plant.</p></details> | 18 pages, 16 figures |

Neuromorphic disciplines view the brain as a coevolved system, simultaneously optimizing the hardware and the algorithms running on it. There are clear efficiency gains when bringing the computations into a physical substrate, but we presently lack theories to guide efficient implementations. Here, we present a principled computational model for neuromorphic systems in terms of spatio-temporal receptive fields, based on affine Gaussian kernels over space and leaky-integrator and leaky integrate-and-fire models over time. Our theory is provably covariant to spatial affine and temporal scaling transformations, and with close similarities to the visual processing in mammalian brains. We use these spatio-temporal receptive fields as a prior in an event-based vision task, and show that this improves the training of spiking networks, which otherwise is known as problematic for event-based vision. This work combines efforts within scale-space theory and computational neuroscience to identify theoretically well-founded ways to process spatio-temporal signals in neuromorphic systems. Our contributions are immediately relevant for signal processing and event-based vision, and can be extended to other processing tasks over space and time, such as memory and control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/jegp/nrf</p></details> |

Despite significant strides in ST modeling in recent years, there remains a need to emphasize harnessing the potential of information from different modalities. Robust MoST forecasting is more challenging because it possesses (i) high-dimensional and complex internal structures and (ii) dynamic heterogeneity caused by temporal, spatial, and modality variations. In this study, we propose a novel MoST learning framework via Self-Supervised Learning, namely MoSSL, which aims to uncover latent patterns from temporal, spatial, and modality perspectives while quantifying dynamic heterogeneity. Experiment results on two real-world MoST datasets verify the superiority of our approach compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.

As one of the important application domains of foundation models, earth observation has attracted attention and various approaches have been developed. When considering earth observation as a single image capture, earth observation imagery can be processed as an image with three or more channels, and when it comes with multiple image captures of different timestamps at one location, the temporal observation can be considered as a set of continuous image resembling video frames or medical SCAN slices. This paper presents Spatio-Temporal SwinMAE (ST-SwinMAE), an architecture which particularly focuses on representation learning for spatio-temporal image processing. Specifically, it uses a hierarchical Masked Auto-encoder (MAE) with Video Swin Transformer blocks. With the architecture, we present a pretrained model named Degas 100M as a geospatial foundation model. Also, we propose an approach for transfer learning with Degas 100M, which both pretrained encoder and decoder of MAE are utilized with skip connections added between them to achieve multi-scale information communication, forms an architecture named Spatio-Temporal SwinUNet (ST-SwinUNet). Our approach shows significant improvements of performance over existing state-of-the-art of foundation models. Specifically, for transfer learning of the land cover downstream task on the PhilEO Bench dataset, it shows 10.4\% higher accuracy compared with other geospatial foundation models on average.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint covariance properties under geometric image transformations for spatio-temporal receptive fields according to the generalized Gaussian derivative model for visual receptive fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10543v5)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The influence of natural image transformations on receptive field responses is crucial for modelling visual operations in computer vision and biological vision. In this regard, covariance properties with respect to geometric image transformations in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy are essential for expressing robust image operations, and for formulating invariant visual operations at higher levels. This paper defines and proves a set of joint covariance properties under compositions of spatial scaling transformations, spatial affine transformations, Galilean transformations and temporal scaling transformations, which make it possible to characterize how different types of image transformations interact with each other and the associated spatio-temporal receptive field responses. In this regard, we also extend the notion of scale-normalized derivatives to affine-normalized derivatives, to be able to obtain true affine-covariant properties of spatial derivatives, that are computed based on spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels. The derived relations show how the parameters of the receptive fields need to be transformed, in order to match the output from spatio-temporal receptive fields under composed spatio-temporal image transformations. As a side effect, the presented proof for the joint covariance property over the integrated combination of the different geometric image transformations also provides specific proofs for the individual transformation properties, which have not previously been fully reported in the literature. The paper also presents an in-depth theoretical analysis of geometric interpretations of the derived covariance properties, as well as outlines a number of biological interpretations of these results.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 13 figures.

In recent years, spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results in the context of numerous traffic forecasting challenges. This work aims at expanding upon the conventional spatio-temporal graph neural network architectures in a manner that may facilitate the inclusion of information regarding the examined regions, as well as the populations that traverse them, in order to establish a more efficient prediction model. The end-product of this scientific endeavour is a novel spatio-temporal graph neural network architecture that is referred to as WEST (WEighted STacked) GCN-LSTM. Furthermore, the inclusion of the aforementioned information is conducted via the use of two novel dedicated algorithms that are referred to as the Shared Borders Policy and the Adjustable Hops Policy. Through information fusion and distillation, the proposed solution manages to significantly outperform its competitors in the frame of an experimental evaluation that consists of 19 forecasting models, across several datasets. Finally, an additional ablation study determined that each of the components of the proposed solution contributes towards enhancing its overall performance.</p></details> |  |

However, there is need to ensure the judicious utilization of allocated bandwidth without compromising the Quality of Service (QoS) of the system. In this regard, this paper presents an approach based on spatio-temporal frame indexing that detects and eliminate redundancy within and across captured frame, prior transmission from the server to clients. The standard and local low motion videos were the two scenarios considered in evaluating the performance of the proposed algorithm. Results obtained showed that the proposed approach achieved an improvement of 5.13%, 15.8% and 5%, 15.6% improvement in terms of the buffer size and compression ratio. Though with a tradeoff of the frame-built time, where both the standard and local frame indexing outperforms the proposed scheme with 10.8% and 8.71% respectively.</p></details> |  |

Our work primarily addresses this, introducing more realistic and flexible models for spatio-temporal random fields. We break away from the traditional confines of the classic frozen field by either relaxing the assumption of a single deterministic velocity or rethinking the hypothesis regarding the spectrum shape, thus enhancing the realism of our models. While the proposed models stand out for their realism and flexibility, they are also paired with simulation algorithms that are equally or less computationally complex than the commonly used circulant embedding for Gaussian random fields in $\mathbb{R}^{2+1}$. This combination of realistic modeling with efficient simulation methods creates an effective solution for better understanding traveling phenomena.</p></details> |  |

Spatio-temporal data, on the other hand, is vital for analyzing phenomena in both space and time, providing a dynamic perspective on complex system interactions. Recently, diffusion models have seen widespread application in time series and spatio-temporal data mining. Not only do they enhance the generative and inferential capabilities for sequential and temporal data, but they also extend to other downstream tasks. In this survey, we comprehensively and thoroughly review the use of diffusion models in time series and spatio-temporal data, categorizing them by model category, task type, data modality, and practical application domain. In detail, we categorize diffusion models into unconditioned and conditioned types and discuss time series data and spatio-temporal data separately. Unconditioned models, which operate unsupervised, are subdivided into probability-based and score-based models, serving predictive and generative tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, and imputation. Conditioned models, on the other hand, utilize extra information to enhance performance and are similarly divided for both predictive and generative tasks. Our survey extensively covers their application in various fields, including healthcare, recommendation, climate, energy, audio, and transportation, providing a foundational understanding of how these models analyze and generate data. Through this structured overview, we aim to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive understanding of diffusion models for time series and spatio-temporal data analysis, aiming to direct future innovations and applications by addressing traditional challenges and exploring innovative solutions within the diffusion model framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing work; 27 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables; Github Repo: https://github.com/yyysjz1997/Awesome-TimeSeries-SpatioTemporal-Diffusion-Model</p></details> |

The knowledge tree enables the visualization of hierarchical interrelation within the STKG, while the knowledge net elucidates semantic relationships among knowledge entities. Additionally, the knowledge map displays spatial and temporal distributions via spatial maps and time axes, respectively. Our visualization technology addresses the limitations inherent in single-view approaches and the deficiency of interaction in spatio-temporal perspectives evident in existing visualization methods. Moreover, we have encapsulated this technology within an integrated, open-source platform named GeoViz.

When using the physics informed neural network (PINN) to simulate the long time evolution, it is necessary to decompose the time domain to capture the transition of solutions in different time. Moreover, the baseline PINN can't maintain the mass conservation property for the equations. We propose a mass-preserving spatio-temporal adaptive PINN. This method adaptively dividing the time domain according to the rate of energy decrease, and solves the Cahn-Hilliard equation in each time step using an independent neural network. To improve the prediction accuracy, spatial adaptive sampling is employed in the subdomain to select points with large residual value and add them to the training samples. Additionally, a mass constraint is added to the loss function to compensate the mass degradation problem of the PINN method in solving the Cahn-Hilliard equations. The mass-preserving spatio-temporal adaptive PINN is employed to solve a series of numerical examples. These include the Cahn-Hilliard equations with different bulk potentials, the three dimensional Cahn-Hilliard equation with singularities, and the set of Cahn-Hilliard equations. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Machine Learning meets Formal Methods: An application to spatio-temporal data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01360v3)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an interdisciplinary framework that combines Bayesian predictive inference, a well-established tool in Machine Learning, with Formal Methods rooted in the computer science community. Bayesian predictive inference allows for coherently incorporating uncertainty about unknown quantities by making use of methods or models that produce predictive distributions, which in turn inform decision problems. By formalizing these decision problems into properties with the help of spatio-temporal logic, we can formulate and predict how likely such properties are to be satisfied in the future at a certain location. Moreover, we can leverage our methodology to evaluate and compare models directly on their ability to predict the satisfaction of application-driven properties. The approach is illustrated in an urban mobility application, where the crowdedness in the center of Milan is proxied by aggregated mobile phone traffic data. We specify several desirable spatio-temporal properties related to city crowdedness such as a fault-tolerant network or the reachability of hospitals. After verifying these properties on draws from the posterior predictive distributions, we compare several spatio-temporal Bayesian models based on their overall and property-based predictive performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Discriminative Spatio-temporal Representations for Semi-supervised Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16416v1)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised action recognition aims to improve spatio-temporal reasoning ability with a few labeled data in conjunction with a large amount of unlabeled data. Albeit recent advancements, existing powerful methods are still prone to making ambiguous predictions under scarce labeled data, embodied as the limitation of distinguishing different actions with similar spatio-temporal information. In this paper, we approach this problem by empowering the model two aspects of capability, namely discriminative spatial modeling and temporal structure modeling for learning discriminative spatio-temporal representations. Specifically, we propose an Adaptive Contrastive Learning~(ACL) strategy. It assesses the confidence of all unlabeled samples by the class prototypes of the labeled data, and adaptively selects positive-negative samples from a pseudo-labeled sample bank to construct contrastive learning. Additionally, we introduce a Multi-scale Temporal Learning~(MTL) strategy. It could highlight informative semantics from long-term clips and integrate them into the short-term clip while suppressing noisy information. Afterwards, both of these two new techniques are integrated in a unified framework to encourage the model to make accurate predictions. Extensive experiments on UCF101, HMDB51 and Kinetics400 show the superiority of our method over prior state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables, 56 conferences</p></details> |

Our key contribution is the development of user-level differentially private algorithms that incorporate carefully chosen parameter values to ensure low estimation errors on real-world datasets, while ensuring privacy. We test our algorithms on ITMS (Intelligent Traffic Management System) data from an Indian city, where the speeds of different buses are drawn in a potentially non-i.i.d. manner from an unknown distribution, and where the number of speed samples contributed by different buses is potentially different. We then apply our algorithms to large synthetic datasets, generated based on the ITMS data. Here, we provide theoretical justification for the observed performance trends, and also provide recommendations for the choices of algorithm subroutines that result in low estimation errors. Finally, we characterize the best performance of pseudo-user creation-based algorithms on worst-case datasets via a minimax approach; this then gives rise to a novel procedure for the creation of pseudo-users, which optimizes the worst-case total estimation error. The algorithms discussed in the paper are readily applicable to general spatio-temporal IoT datasets for releasing a differentially private mean of a desired value.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, submitted to the ACM for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[NoiseNCA: Noisy Seed Improves Spatio-Temporal Continuity of Neural Cellular Automata](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06279v2)** | 2024-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) is a class of Cellular Automata where the update rule is parameterized by a neural network that can be trained using gradient descent. In this paper, we focus on NCA models used for texture synthesis, where the update rule is inspired by partial differential equations (PDEs) describing reaction-diffusion systems. To train the NCA model, the spatio-termporal domain is discretized, and Euler integration is used to numerically simulate the PDE. However, whether a trained NCA truly learns the continuous dynamic described by the corresponding PDE or merely overfits the discretization used in training remains an open question. We study NCA models at the limit where space-time discretization approaches continuity. We find that existing NCA models tend to overfit the training discretization, especially in the proximity of the initial condition, also called "seed". To address this, we propose a solution that utilizes uniform noise as the initial condition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in preserving the consistency of NCA dynamics across a wide range of spatio-temporal granularities. Our improved NCA model enables two new test-time interactions by allowing continuous control over the speed of pattern formation and the scale of the synthesized patterns. We demonstrate this new NCA feature in our interactive online demo. Our work reveals that NCA models can learn continuous dynamics and opens new venues for NCA research from a dynamical systems' perspective.</p></details> | 9 pages, 12 figures |
| **[A Unified Replay-based Continuous Learning Framework for Spatio-Temporal Prediction on Streaming Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14999v1)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread deployment of wireless and mobile devices results in a proliferation of spatio-temporal data that is used in applications, e.g., traffic prediction, human mobility mining, and air quality prediction, where spatio-temporal prediction is often essential to enable safety, predictability, or reliability. Many recent proposals that target deep learning for spatio-temporal prediction suffer from so-called catastrophic forgetting, where previously learned knowledge is entirely forgotten when new data arrives. Such proposals may experience deteriorating prediction performance when applied in settings where data streams into the system. To enable spatio-temporal prediction on streaming data, we propose a unified replay-based continuous learning framework. The framework includes a replay buffer of previously learned samples that are fused with training data using a spatio-temporal mixup mechanism in order to preserve historical knowledge effectively, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting. To enable holistic representation preservation, the framework also integrates a general spatio-temporal autoencoder with a carefully designed spatio-temporal simple siamese (STSimSiam) network that aims to ensure prediction accuracy and avoid holistic feature loss by means of mutual information maximization. The framework further encompasses five spatio-temporal data augmentation methods to enhance the performance of STSimSiam. Extensive experiments on real data offer insight into the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2024</p></details> |
| **[ICST-DNET: An Interpretable Causal Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Network for Traffic Speed Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13853v1)** | 2024-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic speed prediction is significant for intelligent navigation and congestion alleviation. However, making accurate predictions is challenging due to three factors: 1) traffic diffusion, i.e., the spatial and temporal causality existing between the traffic conditions of multiple neighboring roads, 2) the poor interpretability of traffic data with complicated spatio-temporal correlations, and 3) the latent pattern of traffic speed fluctuations over time, such as morning and evening rush. Jointly considering these factors, in this paper, we present a novel architecture for traffic speed prediction, called Interpretable Causal Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Network (ICST-DNET). Specifically, ICST-DENT consists of three parts, namely the Spatio-Temporal Causality Learning (STCL), Causal Graph Generation (CGG), and Speed Fluctuation Pattern Recognition (SFPR) modules. First, to model the traffic diffusion within road networks, an STCL module is proposed to capture both the temporal causality on each individual road and the spatial causality in each road pair. The CGG module is then developed based on STCL to enhance the interpretability of the traffic diffusion procedure from the temporal and spatial perspectives. Specifically, a time causality matrix is generated to explain the temporal causality between each road's historical and future traffic conditions. For spatial causality, we utilize causal graphs to visualize the diffusion process in road pairs. Finally, to adapt to traffic speed fluctuations in different scenarios, we design a personalized SFPR module to select the historical timesteps with strong influences for learning the pattern of traffic speed fluctuations. Extensive experimental results prove that ICST-DNET can outperform all existing baselines, as evidenced by the higher prediction accuracy, ability to explain causality, and adaptability to different scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Typical fine-tuning based adaptation paradigm is prone to overfitting in the few-shot learning scenarios and offers little modeling flexibility for learning temporal features in video data. In this work we present the Disentangled-and-Deformable Spatio-Temporal Adapter (D$^2$ST-Adapter), which is a novel adapter tuning framework well-suited for few-shot action recognition due to lightweight design and low parameter-learning overhead. It is designed in a dual-pathway architecture to encode spatial and temporal features in a disentangled manner. In particular, we devise the anisotropic Deformable Spatio-Temporal Attention module as the core component of D$^2$ST-Adapter, which can be tailored with anisotropic sampling densities along spatial and temporal domains to learn spatial and temporal features specifically in corresponding pathways, allowing our D$^2$ST-Adapter to encode features in a global view in 3D spatio-temporal space while maintaining a lightweight design. Extensive experiments with instantiations of our method on both pre-trained ResNet and ViT demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods for few-shot action recognition. Our method is particularly well-suited to challenging scenarios where temporal dynamics are critical for action recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal Joint Analysis of PM2.5 and Ozone in California with INLA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14446v1)** | 2024-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The substantial threat of concurrent air pollutants to public health is increasingly severe under climate change. To identify the common drivers and extent of spatio-temporal similarity of PM2.5 and ozone, this paper proposed a log Gaussian-Gumbel Bayesian hierarchical model allowing for sharing a SPDE-AR(1) spatio-temporal interaction structure. The proposed model outperforms in terms of estimation accuracy and prediction capacity for its increased parsimony and reduced uncertainty, especially for the shared ozone sub-model. Besides the consistently significant influence of temperature (positive), extreme drought (positive), fire burnt area (positive), and wind speed (negative) on both PM2.5 and ozone, surface pressure and GDP per capita (precipitation) demonstrate only positive associations with PM2.5 (ozone), while population density relates to neither. In addition, our results show the distinct spatio-temporal interactions and different seasonal patterns of PM2.5 and ozone, with peaks of PM2.5 and ozone in cold and hot seasons, respectively. Finally, with the aid of the excursion function, we see that the areas around the intersection of San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties are likely to exceed the unhealthy ozone level for sensitive groups throughout the year. Our findings provide new insights for regional and seasonal strategies in the co-control of PM2.5 and ozone. Our methodology is expected to be utilized when interest lies in multiple interrelated processes in the fields of environment and epidemiology.</p></details> |  |
| **[DST-GTN: Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer Network for Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11996v1)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate traffic forecasting is essential for effective urban planning and congestion management. Deep learning (DL) approaches have gained colossal success in traffic forecasting but still face challenges in capturing the intricacies of traffic dynamics. In this paper, we identify and address this challenges by emphasizing that spatial features are inherently dynamic and change over time. A novel in-depth feature representation, called Dynamic Spatio-Temporal (Dyn-ST) features, is introduced, which encapsulates spatial characteristics across varying times. Moreover, a Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer Network (DST-GTN) is proposed by capturing Dyn-ST features and other dynamic adjacency relations between intersections. The DST-GTN can model dynamic ST relationships between nodes accurately and refine the representation of global and local ST characteristics by adopting adaptive weights in low-pass and all-pass filters, enabling the extraction of Dyn-ST features from traffic time-series data. Through numerical experiments on public datasets, the DST-GTN achieves state-of-the-art performance for a range of traffic forecasting tasks and demonstrates enhanced stability.</p></details> |  |

We augment this data with information on the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and on the climatic regions (Stamp's and Koeppen's classification) and four seasons of India. We use various matrix theory approaches to trim out strong but routine signals, random matrix theory to remove noise, and novel empirical generalised singular-value distributions to establish retention of essential signals in the trimmed data. We make use of the spatial Bergsma statistics to measure spatial association and identify temporal change points in the spatial-association. In particular, our investigation captures a yet unknown change-point over the 72 years under study with drastic changes in spatial-association of DTR in India. It also brings out changes in spatial association with regard to ENSO. We conclude that while studying/modelling Indian DTR data, due consideration should be granted to the strong spatial association that is being persistently exhibited over decades, and provision should be kept for potential change points in the temporal behaviour, which in turn can bring moderate to dramatic changes in the spatial association pattern. Some of our analysis also reaffirms the conclusions made by other authors, regarding spatial and temporal behavior of DTR, adding our own insights. We consider the data from the yearly, seasonal and climatic zones points of view, and discover several new and interesting statistical structures which should be of interest, especially to climatologists and statisticians. Our methods are not country specific and could be used profitably for DTR data from other geographical areas.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equivariant Spatio-Temporal Self-Supervision for LiDAR Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11737v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Popular representation learning methods encourage feature invariance under transformations applied at the input. However, in 3D perception tasks like object localization and segmentation, outputs are naturally equivariant to some transformations, such as rotation. Using pre-training loss functions that encourage equivariance of features under certain transformations provides a strong self-supervision signal while also retaining information of geometric relationships between transformed feature representations. This can enable improved performance in downstream tasks that are equivariant to such transformations. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal equivariant learning framework by considering both spatial and temporal augmentations jointly. Our experiments show that the best performance arises with a pre-training approach that encourages equivariance to translation, scaling, and flip, rotation and scene flow. For spatial augmentations, we find that depending on the transformation, either a contrastive objective or an equivariance-by-classification objective yields best results. To leverage real-world object deformations and motion, we consider sequential LiDAR scene pairs and develop a novel 3D scene flow-based equivariance objective that leads to improved performance overall. We show our pre-training method for 3D object detection which outperforms existing equivariant and invariant approaches in many settings.</p></details> | technical report |

Our approach, namely spatio-temporal motion retargeting (STMR), guides imitation learning procedures by transferring motion from source to target, effectively bridging the morphological disparities by ensuring the feasibility of imitation on the target system. Our STMR method comprises two components: spatial motion retargeting (SMR) and temporal motion retargeting (TMR). On the one hand, SMR tackles motion retargeting at the kinematic level by generating kinematically feasible whole-body motions from keypoint trajectories. On the other hand, TMR aims to retarget motion at the dynamic level by optimizing motion in the temporal domain. We showcase the effectiveness of our method in facilitating Imitation Learning (IL) for complex animal movements through a series of simulation and hardware experiments. In these experiments, our STMR method successfully tailored complex animal motions from various media, including video captured by a hand-held camera, to fit the morphology and physical properties of the target robots. This enabled RL policy training for precise motion tracking, while baseline methods struggled with highly dynamic motion involving flying phases. Moreover, we validated that the control policy can successfully imitate six different motions in two quadruped robots with different dimensions and physical properties in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 7 figures, videos/code available at https://terry97-guel.github.io/STMR-RL.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Towards Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning based Traffic Signal Control through Spatio-temporal Hypergraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11014v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic signal control systems (TSCSs) are integral to intelligent traffic management, fostering efficient vehicle flow. Traditional approaches often simplify road networks into standard graphs, which results in a failure to consider the dynamic nature of traffic data at neighboring intersections, thereby neglecting higher-order interconnections necessary for real-time control. To address this, we propose a novel TSCS framework to realize intelligent traffic control. This framework collaborates with multiple neighboring edge computing servers to collect traffic information across the road network. To elevate the efficiency of traffic signal control, we have crafted a multi-agent soft actor-critic (MA-SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm. Within this algorithm, individual agents are deployed at each intersection with a mandate to optimize traffic flow across the entire road network collectively. Furthermore, we introduce hypergraph learning into the critic network of MA-SAC to enable the spatio-temporal interactions from multiple intersections in the road network. This method fuses hypergraph and spatio-temporal graph structures to encode traffic data and capture the complex spatial and temporal correlations between multiple intersections. Our empirical evaluation, tested on varied datasets, demonstrates the superiority of our framework in minimizing average vehicle travel times and sustaining high-throughput performance. This work facilitates the development of more intelligent and reactive urban traffic management solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A spatio-temporal model to detect potential outliers in disease mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09882v1)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal disease mapping models are commonly used to estimate the relative risk of a disease over time and across areas. For each area and time point, the disease count is modelled with a Poisson distribution whose mean is the product of an offset and the disease relative risk. This relative risk is commonly decomposed in the log scale as the sum of fixed and latent effects. The Rushworth model allows for spatio-temporal autocorrelation of the random effects. We build on the Rushworth model to accommodate and identify potentially outlying areas with respect to their disease relative risk evolution, after taking into account the fixed effects. An area may display outlying behaviour at some points in time but not all. At each time point, we assume the latent effects to be spatially structured and include scaling parameters in the precision matrix, to allow for heavy-tails. Two prior specifications are considered for the scaling parameters: one where they are independent across space and one with spatial autocorrelation. We investigate the performance of the different prior specifications of the proposed model through simulation studies and analyse the weekly evolution of the number of COVID-19 cases across the 33 boroughs of Montreal and the 96 French departments during the second wave. In Montreal, 6 boroughs are found to be potentially outlying. In France, the model with spatially structured scaling parameters identified 21 departments as potential outliers. We find that these departments tend to be close to each other and within common French regions.</p></details> |  |

We further offer Efflex in two versions, Efflex-L for scenarios demanding high accuracy, and Efflex-B for environments requiring swift data processing. Comprehensive experimentation with the Porto and Geolife datasets validates our approach, positioning Efflex as the state-of-the-art in the domain. Such enhancements in speed and accuracy highlight the versatility of Efflex, underscoring its wide-ranging potential for deployment in time-sensitive and computationally constrained applications.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the Mamba architecture, based on state space models, has shown remarkable performance in a series of natural language processing tasks, which can effectively compensate for the shortcomings of the above two architectures. In this paper, we explore for the first time the potential of the Mamba architecture for remote sensing CD tasks. We tailor the corresponding frameworks, called MambaBCD, MambaSCD, and MambaBDA, for binary change detection (BCD), semantic change detection (SCD), and building damage assessment (BDA), respectively. All three frameworks adopt the cutting-edge Visual Mamba architecture as the encoder, which allows full learning of global spatial contextual information from the input images. For the change decoder, which is available in all three architectures, we propose three spatio-temporal relationship modeling mechanisms, which can be naturally combined with the Mamba architecture and fully utilize its attribute to achieve spatio-temporal interaction of multi-temporal features, thereby obtaining accurate change information. On five benchmark datasets, our proposed frameworks outperform current CNN- and Transformer-based approaches without using any complex training strategies or tricks, fully demonstrating the potential of the Mamba architecture in CD tasks. Specifically, we obtained 83.11%, 88.39% and 94.19% F1 scores on the three BCD datasets SYSU, LEVIR-CD+, and WHU-CD; on the SCD dataset SECOND, we obtained 24.11% SeK; and on the BDA dataset xBD, we obtained 81.41% overall F1 score. Further experiments show that our architecture is quite robust to degraded data. The source code will be available in https://github.com/ChenHongruixuan/MambaCD</p></details> |  |

Addressing this distinctive attribute, we propose a Multi-Scale Spatio-temporal CNN-Transformer network (MSSTNet). Our approach takes spatial features of different scales extracted by CNN and feeds them into a Multi-scale Embedding Layer (MELayer). The MELayer extracts multi-scale spatial information and encodes these features before sending them into a Temporal Transformer (T-Former). The T-Former simultaneously extracts temporal information while continually integrating multi-scale spatial information. This process culminates in the generation of multi-scale spatio-temporal features that are utilized for the final classification. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on two in-the-wild datasets. Furthermore, a series of ablation experiments and visualizations provide further validation of our approach's proficiency in leveraging spatio-temporal information within DFER.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2024 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Low-rank Adaptation for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07919v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is crucial in real-world dynamic systems, predicting future changes using historical data from diverse locations. Existing methods often prioritize the development of intricate neural networks to capture the complex dependencies of the data, yet their accuracy fails to show sustained improvement. Besides, these methods also overlook node heterogeneity, hindering customized prediction modules from handling diverse regional nodes effectively. In this paper, our goal is not to propose a new model but to present a novel low-rank adaptation framework as an off-the-shelf plugin for existing spatial-temporal prediction models, termed ST-LoRA, which alleviates the aforementioned problems through node-level adjustments. Specifically, we first tailor a node adaptive low-rank layer comprising multiple trainable low-rank matrices. Additionally, we devise a multi-layer residual fusion stacking module, injecting the low-rank adapters into predictor modules of various models. Across six real-world traffic datasets and six different types of spatio-temporal prediction models, our approach minimally increases the parameters and training time of the original models by less than 4%, still achieving consistent and sustained performance enhancement.</p></details> |  |

The associated challenges are exacerbated when solutions to these interconnected problems need to both maximize task performance and respect practical constraints on time and resources. In this work, we formulate a new class of spatio-temporal heterogeneous task allocation problems that consider these complexities. We contribute a novel framework, named Quality-Optimized Incremental Task Allocation Graph Search (Q-ITAGS), to solve such problems. Q-ITAGS builds upon our prior work in trait-based coordination and offers a flexible interleaved framework that i) explicitly models and optimizes the effect of collective capabilities on task performance via learnable trait-quality maps, and ii) respects both resource constraints and spatio-temporal constraints, including a user-specified time budget (i.e., maximum makespan). In addition to algorithmic contributions, we derive theoretical suboptimality bounds in terms of task performance that varies as a function of a single hyperparameter. Our detailed experiments involving a simulated emergency response task and a real-world video game dataset reveal that i) Q-ITAGS results in superior team performance compared to a state-of-the-art method, while also respecting complex spatio-temporal and resource constraints, ii) Q-ITAGS efficiently learns trait-quality maps to enable effective trade-off between task performance and resource constraints, and iii) Q-ITAGS' suboptimality bounds consistently hold in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.13092</p></details> |

Specifically, in the context of estimation, we seek the most likely evolution realizing prescribed spatio-temporal marginals of stopped particles. In the context of control, we seek the control action directing the stochastic flow toward spatio-temporal probabilistic constraints. To this end, we derive a new Schr\"odinger system of coupled, in space and time, partial differential equations to construct the solution of the proposed problem. Further, we show that a Fortet-Sinkhorn type of algorithm is, once again, available to attain the associated bridge. A key feature of the framework is that the obtained bridge retains the Markovian structure in the prior process, and thereby, the corresponding control action takes the form of state feedback.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |

The restoration and enhancement have proven to be highly beneficial. However, there are only a limited number of enhancement methods explicitly designed for videos acquired in low-light conditions. We propose a Spatio-Temporal Aligned SUNet (STA-SUNet) model using a Swin Transformer as a backbone to capture low light video features and exploit their spatio-temporal correlations. The STA-SUNet model is trained on a novel, fully registered dataset (BVI), which comprises dynamic scenes captured under varying light conditions. It is further analysed comparatively against various other models over three test datasets. The model demonstrates superior adaptivity across all datasets, obtaining the highest PSNR and SSIM values. It is particularly effective in extreme low-light conditions, yielding fairly good visualisation results.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we utilize SeasFire, a comprehensive global wildfire dataset with climate, vegetation, oceanic indices, and human-related variables, to enable seasonal wildfire forecasting with machine learning. For the predictive analysis, we train deep learning models with different architectures that capture the spatio-temporal context leading to wildfires. Our investigation focuses on assessing the effectiveness of these models in predicting the presence of burned areas at varying forecasting time horizons globally, extending up to six months into the future, and on how different spatial or/and temporal context affects the performance of the models. Our findings demonstrate the great potential of deep learning models in seasonal fire forecasting; longer input time-series leads to more robust predictions across varying forecasting horizons, while integrating spatial information to capture wildfire spatio-temporal dynamics boosts performance. Finally, our results hint that in order to enhance performance at longer forecasting horizons, a larger receptive field spatially needs to be considered.</p></details> |  |

However, the intricate nature of self-attention introduces practical challenges, as existing state-of-the-art methods often demand high-end GPUs or exhibit slow inference speeds, especially for high-resolution images like 2K. Striking an optimal balance between performance and latency remains a critical concern. In response, this work presents PASTA, a novel Progressively Aggregated Spatio-Temporal Alignment framework for HDR deghosting. Our approach achieves effectiveness and efficiency by harnessing hierarchical representation during feature distanglement. Through the utilization of diverse granularities within the hierarchical structure, our method substantially boosts computational speed and optimizes the HDR imaging workflow. In addition, we explore within-scale feature modeling with local and global attention, gradually merging and refining them in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Experimental results showcase PASTA's superiority over current SOTA methods in both visual quality and performance metrics, accompanied by a substantial 3-fold (x3) increase in inference speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video Anomaly Detection via Spatio-Temporal Pseudo-Anomaly Generation : A Unified Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16514v2)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is an open-set recognition task, which is usually formulated as a one-class classification (OCC) problem, where training data is comprised of videos with normal instances while test data contains both normal and anomalous instances. Recent works have investigated the creation of pseudo-anomalies (PAs) using only the normal data and making strong assumptions about real-world anomalies with regards to abnormality of objects and speed of motion to inject prior information about anomalies in an autoencoder (AE) based reconstruction model during training. This work proposes a novel method for generating generic spatio-temporal PAs by inpainting a masked out region of an image using a pre-trained Latent Diffusion Model and further perturbing the optical flow using mixup to emulate spatio-temporal distortions in the data. In addition, we present a simple unified framework to detect real-world anomalies under the OCC setting by learning three types of anomaly indicators, namely reconstruction quality, temporal irregularity and semantic inconsistency. Extensive experiments on four VAD benchmark datasets namely Ped2, Avenue, ShanghaiTech and UBnormal demonstrate that our method performs on par with other existing state-of-the-art PAs generation and reconstruction based methods under the OCC setting. Our analysis also examines the transferability and generalisation of PAs across these datasets, offering valuable insights by identifying real-world anomalies through PAs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPRW 2024 - VAND Workshop</p></details> |

Existing approaches struggle to establish effective symbolic reasoning structures, which are crucial for answering compositional spatio-temporal questions. To address this challenge, we propose a neural-symbolic framework called Neural-Symbolic VideoQA (NS-VideoQA), specifically designed for real-world VideoQA tasks. The uniqueness and superiority of NS-VideoQA are two-fold: 1) It proposes a Scene Parser Network (SPN) to transform static-dynamic video scenes into Symbolic Representation (SR), structuralizing persons, objects, relations, and action chronologies. 2) A Symbolic Reasoning Machine (SRM) is designed for top-down question decompositions and bottom-up compositional reasonings. Specifically, a polymorphic program executor is constructed for internally consistent reasoning from SR to the final answer. As a result, Our NS-VideoQA not only improves the compositional spatio-temporal reasoning in real-world VideoQA task, but also enables step-by-step error analysis by tracing the intermediate results. Experimental evaluations on the AGQA Decomp benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NS-VideoQA framework. Empirical studies further confirm that NS-VideoQA exhibits internal consistency in answering compositional questions and significantly improves the capability of spatio-temporal and logical inference for VideoQA tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized Federated Learning for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting: A Dual Semantic Alignment-Based Contrastive Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03702v1)** | 2024-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The existing federated learning (FL) methods for spatio-temporal forecasting fail to capture the inherent spatio-temporal heterogeneity, which calls for personalized FL (PFL) methods to model the spatio-temporally variant patterns. While contrastive learning approach is promising in addressing spatio-temporal heterogeneity, the existing methods are noneffective in determining negative pairs and can hardly apply to PFL paradigm. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel PFL method, named Federated dUal sEmantic aLignment-based contraStive learning (FUELS), which can adaptively align positive and negative pairs based on semantic similarity, thereby injecting precise spatio-temporal heterogeneity into the latent representation space by auxiliary contrastive tasks. From temporal perspective, a hard negative filtering module is introduced to dynamically align heterogeneous temporal representations for the supplemented intra-client contrastive task. From spatial perspective, we design lightweight-but-efficient prototypes as client-level semantic representations, based on which the server evaluates spatial similarity and yields client-customized global prototypes for the supplemented inter-client contrastive task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FUELS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with communication cost decreasing by around 94%.</p></details> |  |

Regardless of the recipient, the message space and time scale could be too fast, too slow, too large, or too small and may never be decoded. Therefore, it pays to devise a way to encode messages agnostic of space and time scales. We propose the use of fractal functions as self-executable infinite-frequency carriers for sending messages, given their properties of structural self-similarity and scale invariance. We call it `fractal messaging'. Starting from a spatial embedding, we introduce a framework for a space-time scale-free messaging approach to this challenge. When considering a space and time-agnostic framework for message transmission, it would be interesting to encode a message such that it could be decoded at several spatio-temporal scales. Hence, the core idea of the framework proposed herein is to encode a binary message as waves along infinitely many frequencies (in power-like distributions) and amplitudes, transmit such a message, and then decode and reproduce it. To do so, the components of the Weierstrass function, a known fractal, are used as carriers of the message. Each component will have its amplitude modulated to embed the binary stream, allowing for a space-time-agnostic approach to messaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages + appendix (21 pages total)</p></details> |

This paper addresses a critical limitation in current video grounding methodologies by introducing an Open-Vocabulary Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding task. Unlike prevalent closed-set approaches that struggle with open-vocabulary scenarios due to limited training data and predefined vocabularies, our model leverages pre-trained representations from foundational spatial grounding models. This empowers it to effectively bridge the semantic gap between natural language and diverse visual content, achieving strong performance in closed-set and open-vocabulary settings. Our contributions include a novel spatio-temporal video grounding model, surpassing state-of-the-art results in closed-set evaluations on multiple datasets and demonstrating superior performance in open-vocabulary scenarios. Notably, the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in closed-set settings on VidSTG (Declarative and Interrogative) and HC-STVG (V1 and V2) datasets. Furthermore, in open-vocabulary evaluations on HC-STVG V1 and YouCook-Interactions, our model surpasses the recent best-performing models by $4.88$ m_vIoU and $1.83\%$ accuracy, demonstrating its efficacy in handling diverse linguistic and visual concepts for improved video understanding.

Dominant pipelines propose to tackle the visual discrepancies with additional temporal learners while overlooking the substantial discrepancy for web-scaled descriptive narratives and concise action category names, leading to less distinct semantic space and potential performance limitations. In this work, we prioritize the refinement of text knowledge to facilitate generalizable video recognition. To address the limitations of the less distinct semantic space of category names, we prompt a large language model (LLM) to augment action class names into Spatio-Temporal Descriptors thus bridging the textual discrepancy and serving as a knowledge base for general recognition. Moreover, to assign the best descriptors with different video instances, we propose Optimal Descriptor Solver, forming the video recognition problem as solving the optimal matching flow across frame-level representations and descriptors. Comprehensive evaluations in zero-shot, few-shot, and fully supervised video recognition highlight the effectiveness of our approach. Our best model achieves a state-of-the-art zero-shot accuracy of 75.1% on Kinetics-600.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report.

To correctly exploit the provided information by each sensor in a single common frame, it is essential for these sensors to be accurately calibrated. In this paper, we leverage the ability of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to represent different sensors modalities in a common volumetric representation to achieve robust and accurate spatio-temporal sensor calibration. By designing a partitioning approach based on the visible part of the scene for each sensor, we formulate the calibration problem using only the overlapping areas. This strategy results in a more robust and accurate calibration that is less prone to failure. We demonstrate that our approach works on outdoor urban scenes by validating it on multiple established driving datasets. Results show that our method is able to get better accuracy and robustness compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2024.

There is increasing interest in achieving 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy (CFE) matching in electricity usage, aiming to eliminate all carbon footprints associated with electricity consumption on an hourly basis. However, the variability of renewable energy resources poses significant challenges for achieving this goal. We explore the impact of shifting computing jobs and associated power loads both in time and between datacenter locations. We develop an optimization model to simulate a network of geographically distributed datacenters managed by a company leveraging spatio-temporal load flexibility to achieve 24/7 CFE matching. We isolate three signals relevant for informed use of load flexiblity: varying average quality of renewable energy resources, low correlation between wind power generation over long distances due to different weather conditions, and lags in solar radiation peak due to Earth's rotation. We illustrate that the location of datacenters and the time of year affect which signal drives an effective load-shaping strategy. The energy procurement and load-shifting decisions based on informed use of these signals facilitate the resource-efficiency and cost-effectiveness of clean computing -- the costs of 24/7 CFE are reduced by 1.29$\pm$0.07 EUR/MWh for every additional percentage of flexible load. We provide practical guidelines on how companies with datacenters can leverage spatio-temporal load flexibility for truly clean computing. Our results and the open-source optimization model can also be useful for a broader variety of companies with flexible loads and an interest in eliminating their carbon footprint.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel generative pre-training framework, GPD, for spatio-temporal few-shot learning with urban knowledge transfer. Unlike conventional approaches that heavily rely on common feature extraction or intricate few-shot learning designs, our solution takes a novel approach by performing generative pre-training on a collection of neural network parameters optimized with data from source cities. We recast spatio-temporal few-shot learning as pre-training a generative diffusion model, which generates tailored neural networks guided by prompts, allowing for adaptability to diverse data distributions and city-specific characteristics. GPD employs a Transformer-based denoising diffusion model, which is model-agnostic to integrate with powerful spatio-temporal neural networks. By addressing challenges arising from data gaps and the complexity of generalizing knowledge across cities, our framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on multiple real-world datasets for tasks such as traffic speed prediction and crowd flow prediction.

The accuracy of expression spotting is affected not only by irrelevant facial movements but also by the difficulty of perceiving subtle motions in micro-expressions. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (SpoT-GCN) for facial expression spotting. To extract more robust motion features, we track both short- and long-term motion of facial muscles in compact sliding windows whose window length adapts to the temporal receptive field of the network. This strategy, termed the receptive field adaptive sliding window strategy, effectively magnifies the motion features while alleviating the problem of severe head movement. The subtle motion features are then converted to a facial graph representation, whose spatio-temporal graph patterns are learned by a graph convolutional network. This network learns both local and global features from multiple scales of facial graph structures using our proposed facial local graph pooling (FLGP). Furthermore, we introduce supervised contrastive learning to enhance the discriminative capability of our model for difficult-to-classify frames. The experimental results on the SAMM-LV and CAS(ME)^2 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in micro-expression spotting. Ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of our proposed modules.</p></details> | Accepted by FG2024 |

However, existing methods, which depend solely on appearance matching via Siamese networks or utilize motion information from successive frames, encounter significant challenges. Issues such as similar objects nearby or occlusions can result in tracker drift. To mitigate these challenges, we design an innovative spatio-temporal bi-directional cross-frame distractor filtering tracker, named STMD-Tracker. Our first step involves the creation of a 4D multi-frame spatio-temporal graph convolution backbone. This design separates KNN graph spatial embedding and incorporates 1D temporal convolution, effectively capturing temporal fluctuations and spatio-temporal information. Subsequently, we devise a novel bi-directional cross-frame memory procedure. This integrates future and synthetic past frame memory to enhance the current memory, thereby improving the accuracy of iteration-based tracking. This iterative memory update mechanism allows our tracker to dynamically compensate for information in the current frame, effectively reducing tracker drift. Lastly, we construct spatially reliable Gaussian masks on the fused features to eliminate distractor points. This is further supplemented by an object-aware sampling strategy, which bolsters the efficiency and precision of object localization, thereby reducing tracking errors caused by distractors. Our extensive experiments on KITTI, NuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly surpasses the current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 18 pages,6 figures |

PAR presents two major challenges: 1) recognizing the nuanced interactions among numerous individuals and 2) understanding multi-granular human activities. To address these, we propose Social Proximity-aware Dual-Path Network (SPDP-Net) based on two key design principles. First, while previous works often focus on spatial distance among individuals within an image, we argue to consider the spatio-temporal proximity. It is crucial for individual relation encoding to correctly understand social dynamics. Secondly, deviating from existing hierarchical approaches (individual-to-social-to-global activity), we introduce a dual-path architecture for multi-granular activity recognition. This architecture comprises individual-to-global and individual-to-social paths, mutually reinforcing each other's task with global-local context through multiple layers. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of the spatio-temporal proximity among individuals and the dual-path architecture in PAR. Furthermore, SPDP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance with 46.5\% of overall F1 score on JRDB-PAR dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[$GRU^{spa}$: Gated Recurrent Unit with Spatial Attention for Spatio-Temporal Disaggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07292v3)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open data is frequently released spatially aggregated, usually to comply with privacy policies. But coarse, heterogeneous aggregations complicate learning and integration for downstream AI/ML systems. In this work, we consider models to disaggregate spatio-temporal data from a low-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., census tract) to a high-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., city block). We propose a model, Gated Recurrent Unit with Spatial Attention ($GRU^{spa}$), where spatial attention layers are integrated into the original Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model. The spatial attention layers capture spatial interactions among regions, while the gated recurrent module captures the temporal dependencies. Additionally, we utilize containment relationships between different geographic levels (e.g., when a given city block is wholly contained in a given census tract) to constrain the spatial attention layers. For situations where limited historical training data is available, we study transfer learning scenarios and show that a model pre-trained on one city variable can be fine-tuned for another city variable using only a few hundred samples. Evaluating these techniques on two mobility datasets, we find that $GRU^{spa}$ provides a significant improvement over other neural models as well as typical heuristic methods, allowing us to synthesize realistic point data over small regions useful for training downstream models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guiding Masked Representation Learning to Capture Spatio-Temporal Relationship of Electrocardiogram](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09450v3)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electrocardiograms (ECG) are widely employed as a diagnostic tool for monitoring electrical signals originating from a heart. Recent machine learning research efforts have focused on the application of screening various diseases using ECG signals. However, adapting to the application of screening disease is challenging in that labeled ECG data are limited. Achieving general representation through self-supervised learning (SSL) is a well-known approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data; however, a naive application of SSL to ECG data, without considering the spatial-temporal relationships inherent in ECG signals, may yield suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce ST-MEM (Spatio-Temporal Masked Electrocardiogram Modeling), designed to learn spatio-temporal features by reconstructing masked 12-lead ECG data. ST-MEM outperforms other SSL baseline methods in various experimental settings for arrhythmia classification tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that ST-MEM is adaptable to various lead combinations. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we show a spatio-temporal relationship within ECG data.

In the upstream stage, we design a vector quantization reconstruction module with temporal evolution characteristics, ensuring balanced and resilient parameter distribution by introducing general physical constraints. In the downstream stage, a diffusion probability network involving parameters is utilized to generate high-quality future states of fluids, while enhancing the model's generalization ability by perceiving parameters in various physical setups. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets have verified the effectiveness and robustness of the ST-PAD framework, which showcase that ST-PAD outperforms current mainstream models in fluid dynamics modeling and prediction, especially in effectively capturing local representations and maintaining significant advantages in OOD generations.</p></details> |  |
| **[LIST: Learning to Index Spatio-Textual Data for Embedding based Spatial Keyword Queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07331v2)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the proliferation of spatio-textual data, Top-k KNN spatial keyword queries (TkQs), which return a list of objects based on a ranking function that evaluates both spatial and textual relevance, have found many real-life applications. Existing geo-textual indexes for TkQs use traditional retrieval models like BM25 to compute text relevance and usually exploit a simple linear function to compute spatial relevance, but its effectiveness is limited. To improve effectiveness, several deep learning models have recently been proposed, but they suffer severe efficiency issues. To the best of our knowledge, there are no efficient indexes specifically designed to accelerate the top-k search process for these deep learning models. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel technique, which Learns to Index the Spatio-Textual data for answering embedding based spatial keyword queries (called LIST). LIST is featured with two novel components. Firstly, we propose a lightweight and effective relevance model that is capable of learning both textual and spatial relevance. Secondly, we introduce a novel machine learning based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) index, which utilizes a new learning-to-cluster technique to group relevant queries and objects together while separating irrelevant queries and objects. Two key challenges in building an effective and efficient index are the absence of high-quality labels and unbalanced clustering results. We develop a novel pseudo-label generation technique to address the two challenges. Experimental results show that LIST significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on effectiveness, with improvements up to 19.21% and 12.79% in terms of NDCG@1 and Recall@10, and is three orders of magnitude faster than the most effective baseline.</p></details> |  |

Our focus lies in the parametric estimation of its intensity function, incorporating both spatial factors (such as altitude) and spatio-temporal covariates (such as field temperature, precipitation, etc.). The events are observed in France over a span of three years. Spatio-temporal covariates are observed with resolution $0.1^\circ \times 0.1^\circ$ ($\approx 100$km$^2$) and six-hour periods. This results in an extensive dataset, further characterized by a significant excess of zeroes (i.e., spatio-temporal cells with no observed events). We reexamine composite likelihood methods commonly employed for spatial point processes, especially in situations where covariates are piecewise constant. Additionally, we extend these methods to account for zero-deflated subsampling, a strategy involving dependent subsampling, with a focus on selecting more cells in regions where events are observed. A simulation study is conducted to illustrate these novel methodologies, followed by their application to the dataset of lightning strikes.</p></details> |  |

It automatically decomposes the given task into smaller, more manageable subtasks, and thus enables sparse decision-making and focused computation on the relevant parts of the environment. The decomposition relies on the extraction of an abstracted proxy problem represented as a directed graph, in which vertices and edges are learned end-to-end from hindsight. Our theoretical analyses provide performance guarantees under appropriate assumptions and establish where our approach is expected to be helpful. Generalization-focused experiments validate Skipper's significant advantage in zero-shot generalization, compared to some existing state-of-the-art hierarchical planning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2024 Camera-Ready</p></details> |

| **[Bayesian Design for Sampling Anomalous Spatio-Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10791v1)** | 2024-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data collected from arrays of sensors are essential for informed decision-making in various systems. However, the presence of anomalies can compromise the accuracy and reliability of insights drawn from the collected data or information obtained via statistical analysis. This study aims to develop a robust Bayesian optimal experimental design (BOED) framework with anomaly detection methods for high-quality data collection. We introduce a general framework that involves anomaly generation, detection and error scoring when searching for an optimal design. This method is demonstrated using two comprehensive simulated case studies: the first study uses a spatial dataset, and the second uses a spatio-temporal river network dataset. As a baseline approach, we employed a commonly used prediction-based utility function based on minimising errors. Results illustrate the trade-off between predictive accuracy and anomaly detection performance for our method under various design scenarios. An optimal design robust to anomalies ensures the collection and analysis of more trustworthy data, playing a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of complex systems such as the environment, therefore enabling informed decisions in monitoring, management, and response.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal Occupancy Models with INLA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10680v1)** | 2024-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern methods for quantifying and predicting species distribution play a crucial part in biodiversity conservation. Occupancy models are a popular choice for analyzing species occurrence data as they allow to separate the observational error induced by imperfect detection, and the sources of bias affecting the occupancy process. However, the spatial and temporal variation in occupancy not accounted for by environmental covariates is often ignored or modelled through simple spatial structures as the computational costs of fitting explicit spatio-temporal models is too high. In this work, we demonstrate how INLA may be used to fit complex occupancy models and how the R-INLA package can provide a user-friendly interface to make such complex models available to users. We show how occupancy models, provided some simplification on the detection process, can be framed as latent Gaussian models and benefit from the powerful INLA machinery. A large selection of complex modelling features, and random effect modelshave already been implemented in R-INLA. These become available for occupancy models, providing the user with an efficient and flexible toolbox. We illustrate how INLA provides a computationally efficient framework for developing and fitting complex occupancy models using two case studies. Through these, we show how different spatio-temporal models that include spatial-varying trends, smooth terms, and spatio-temporal random effects can be fitted. At the cost of limiting the complexity of the detection model, INLA can incorporate a range of complex structures in the process. INLA-based occupancy models provide an alternative framework to fit complex spatiotemporal occupancy models. The need for new and more flexible computationally approaches to fit such models makes INLA an attractive option for addressing complex ecological problems, and a promising area of research.</p></details> |  |

However, estimating incidence or mortality rates associated with rare cancers presents important difficulties and poses new statistical methodological challenges. In this paper, we expand the collection of multivariate spatio-temporal models by introducing adaptable shared interactions to enable a comprehensive analysis of both incidence and cancer mortality in rare cancer cases. These models allow the modulation of spatio-temporal interactions between incidence and mortality, allowing for changes in their relationship over time. The new models have been implemented in INLA using r-generic constructions. We conduct a simulation study to evaluate the performance of the new spatio-temporal models in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Results show that multivariate spatio-temporal models with flexible shared interaction outperform conventional multivariate spatio-temporal models with independent interactions. We use these models to analyze incidence and mortality data for pancreatic cancer and leukaemia among males across 142 administrative healthcare districts of Great Britain over a span of nine biennial periods (2002-2019).</p></details> | 39 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Cardiac Magnetic Resonance 2D+T Short- and Long-axis Segmentation via Spatio-temporal SAM Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10009v1)** | 2024-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 2D+T myocardium segmentation in cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) scans is essential to analyze LV motion throughout the cardiac cycle comprehensively. The Segment Anything Model (SAM), known for its accurate segmentation and zero-shot generalization, has not yet been tailored for CMR 2D+T segmentation. We therefore introduce CMR2D+T-SAM, a novel approach to adapt SAM for CMR 2D+T segmentation using spatio-temporal adaption. This approach also incorporates a U-Net framework for multi-scale feature extraction, as well as text prompts for accurate segmentation on both short-axis (SAX) and long-axis (LAX) views using a single model. CMR2D+T-SAM outperforms existing deep learning methods on the STACOM2011 dataset, achieving a myocardium Dice score of 0.885 and a Hausdorff distance (HD) of 2.900 pixels. It also demonstrates superior zero-shot generalization on the ACDC dataset with a Dice score of 0.840 and a HD of 4.076 pixels.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Autoregressive Queries for Adaptive Tracking with Spatio-TemporalTransformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10574v1)** | 2024-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rich spatio-temporal information is crucial to capture the complicated target appearance variations in visual tracking. However, most top-performing tracking algorithms rely on many hand-crafted components for spatio-temporal information aggregation. Consequently, the spatio-temporal information is far away from being fully explored. To alleviate this issue, we propose an adaptive tracker with spatio-temporal transformers (named AQATrack), which adopts simple autoregressive queries to effectively learn spatio-temporal information without many hand-designed components. Firstly, we introduce a set of learnable and autoregressive queries to capture the instantaneous target appearance changes in a sliding window fashion. Then, we design a novel attention mechanism for the interaction of existing queries to generate a new query in current frame. Finally, based on the initial target template and learnt autoregressive queries, a spatio-temporal information fusion module (STM) is designed for spatiotemporal formation aggregation to locate a target object. Benefiting from the STM, we can effectively combine the static appearance and instantaneous changes to guide robust tracking. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves the tracker's performance on six popular tracking benchmarks: LaSOT, LaSOText, TrackingNet, GOT-10k, TNL2K, and UAV123.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal methods for estimating subsurface ocean thermal response to tropical cyclones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15130v5)** | 2024-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tropical cyclones (TCs), driven by heat exchange between the air and sea, pose a substantial risk to many communities around the world. Accurate characterization of the subsurface ocean thermal response to TC passage is crucial for accurate TC intensity forecasts and for an understanding of the role that TCs play in the global climate system. However, that characterization is complicated by the high-noise ocean environment, correlations inherent in spatio-temporal data, relative scarcity of in situ observations, and the entanglement of the TC-induced signal with seasonal signals. We present a general methodological framework that addresses these difficulties, integrating existing techniques in seasonal mean field estimation, Gaussian process modeling, and nonparametric regression into an ANOVA decomposition model. Importantly, we improve upon past work by properly handling seasonality, providing rigorous uncertainty quantification, and treating time as a continuous variable, rather than producing estimates that are binned in time. This ANOVA model is estimated using in situ subsurface temperature profiles from the Argo fleet of autonomous floats through a multi-step procedure, which (1) characterizes the upper ocean seasonal shift during the TC season; (2) models the variability in the temperature observations; (3) fits a thin plate spline using the variability estimates to account for heteroskedasticity and correlation between the observations. This spline fit reveals the ocean thermal response to TC passage. Through this framework, we obtain new scientific insights into the interaction between TCs and the ocean on a global scale, including a three-dimensional characterization of the near-surface and subsurface cooling along the TC storm track and the mixing-induced subsurface warming on the track's right side.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 14 figures; supplement and code at https://github.com/huisaddison/tc-ocean-methods</p></details> |

Nevertheless, the performance of CNN-based detection models is ambiguous when detection speed is considered. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been sufficient evaluation of the available methods in terms of the speed/accuracy trade-off in related literature. This work assesses the most fundamental object detection models on the Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset with respect to this trade-off, their memory consumption, and computational and storage cost. Next, we select a highly efficient model called YOLOv5 to train on the topical and unexplored dataset of human faces with medical masks, the Properly-Wearing Masked Faces Dataset (PWMFD), and analyze the benefits of specific optimization techniques for real-time medical mask detection: transfer learning, data augmentations, and a Squeeze-and-Excitation attention mechanism. Using our findings in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we propose an optimized model based on YOLOv5s using transfer learning for the detection of correctly and incorrectly worn medical masks that surpassed more than two times in speed (69 frames per second) the state-of-the-art model SE-YOLOv3 on the PWMFD dataset while maintaining the same level of mean Average Precision (67%).</p></details> |  |
| **[Frustratingly Easy Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18330v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models seamlessly discriminate among arbitrary semantic categories, yet they still suffer from poor generalization when presented with challenging examples. For this reason, Episodic Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategies have recently emerged as powerful techniques to adapt VLMs in the presence of a single unlabeled image. The recent literature on TTA is dominated by the paradigm of prompt tuning by Marginal Entropy Minimization, which, relying on online backpropagation, inevitably slows down inference while increasing memory. In this work, we theoretically investigate the properties of this approach and unveil that a surprisingly strong TTA method lies dormant and hidden within it. We term this approach ZERO (TTA with "zero" temperature), whose design is both incredibly effective and frustratingly simple: augment N times, predict, retain the most confident predictions, and marginalize after setting the Softmax temperature to zero. Remarkably, ZERO requires a single batched forward pass through the vision encoder only and no backward passes. We thoroughly evaluate our approach following the experimental protocol established in the literature and show that ZERO largely surpasses or compares favorably w.r.t. the state-of-the-art while being almost 10x faster and 13x more memory-friendly than standard Test-Time Prompt Tuning. Thanks to its simplicity and comparatively negligible computation, ZERO can serve as a strong baseline for future work in this field.

The recent surge in phishing attacks keeps undermining the effectiveness of the traditional anti-phishing blacklist approaches. On-device anti-phishing solutions are gaining popularity as they offer faster phishing detection locally. Aim. We aim to eliminate the delay in recognizing and recording phishing campaigns in databases via on-device solutions that identify phishing sites immediately when encountered by the user rather than waiting for a web crawler's scan to finish. Additionally, utilizing operating system-specific resources and frameworks, we aim to minimize the impact on system performance and depend on local processing to protect user privacy. Method. We propose a phishing detection solution that uses a combination of computer vision and on-device machine learning models to analyze websites in real time. Our reference-based approach analyzes the visual content of webpages, identifying phishing attempts through layout analysis, credential input areas detection, and brand impersonation criteria combination. Results. Our case study shows it's feasible to perform background processing on-device continuously, for the case of the web browser requiring the resource use of 16% of a single CPU core and less than 84MB of RAM on Apple M1 while maintaining the accuracy of brand logo detection at 46.6% (comparable with baselines), and of Credential Requiring Page detection at 98.1% (improving the baseline by 3.1%), within the test dataset. Conclusions. Our results demonstrate the potential of on-device, real-time phishing detection systems to enhance cybersecurity defensive technologies and extend the scope of phishing detection to more similar regions of interest, e.g., email clients and messenger windows.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, 8 tables.

| **[Time Series Representation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18165v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis remains a major challenge due to its sparse characteristics, high dimensionality, and inconsistent data quality. Recent advancements in transformer-based techniques have enhanced capabilities in forecasting and imputation; however, these methods are still resource-heavy, lack adaptability, and face difficulties in integrating both local and global attributes of time series. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new architectural concept for time series analysis based on introspection. Central to this concept is the self-supervised pretraining of Time Series Representation Models (TSRMs), which once learned can be easily tailored and fine-tuned for specific tasks, such as forecasting and imputation, in an automated and resource-efficient manner. Our architecture is equipped with a flexible and hierarchical representation learning process, which is robust against missing data and outliers. It can capture and learn both local and global features of the structure, semantics, and crucial patterns of a given time series category, such as heart rate data. Our learned time series representation models can be efficiently adapted to a specific task, such as forecasting or imputation, without manual intervention. Furthermore, our architecture's design supports explainability by highlighting the significance of each input value for the task at hand. Our empirical study using four benchmark datasets shows that, compared to investigated state-of-the-art baseline methods, our architecture improves imputation and forecasting errors by up to 90.34% and 71.54%, respectively, while reducing the required trainable parameters by up to 92.43%.

While prior studies have largely employed reconstruction-based approaches, which limits the models' representational capacities. Moreover, existing deep learning-based methods are not sufficiently lightweight. Addressing these issues, we present PatchAD, our novel, highly efficient multiscale patch-based MLP-Mixer architecture that utilizes contrastive learning for representation extraction and anomaly detection.

| **[Low-Resource Crop Classification from Multi-Spectral Time Series Using Lossless Compressors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18119v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has significantly improved the accuracy of crop classification using multispectral temporal data. However, these models have complex structures with numerous parameters, requiring large amounts of data and costly training. In low-resource situations with fewer labeled samples, deep learning models perform poorly due to insufficient data. Conversely, compressors are data-type agnostic, and non-parametric methods do not bring underlying assumptions. Inspired by this insight, we propose a non-training alternative to deep learning models, aiming to address these situations. Specifically, the Symbolic Representation Module is proposed to convert the reflectivity into symbolic representations. The symbolic representations are then cross-transformed in both the channel and time dimensions to generate symbolic embeddings. Next, the Multi-scale Normalised Compression Distance (MNCD) is designed to measure the correlation between any two symbolic embeddings. Finally, based on the MNCDs, high quality crop classification can be achieved using only a k-nearest-neighbor classifier kNN. The entire framework is ready-to-use and lightweight. Without any training, it outperformed, on average, 7 advanced deep learning models trained at scale on three benchmark datasets. It also outperforms more than half of these models in the few-shot setting with sparse crop labels. Therefore, the high performance and robustness of our non-training framework makes it truly applicable to real-world crop mapping. Codes are available at: https://github.com/qinfengsama/Compressor-Based-Crop-Mapping.</p></details> | 8 pages, 10 figures |

The present analysis can be applied to the electronic many-body time-dependent Schr{\"o}dinger equation with an arbitrary number of electrons and interaction potentials with Coulomb singularities. We motivate the interest of the present approach with two goals: first, the design of Galerkin space-time discretization methods; second, the definition of dynamical low-rank approximations following a variational principle different from the classical Dirac-Frenkel principle, and for which it is possible to prove the global-in-time existence of solutions.</p></details> |  |

| **[Learning-Based Link Anomaly Detection in Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18050v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in continuous-time dynamic graphs is an emerging field yet under-explored in the context of learning-based approaches. In this paper, we pioneer structured analyses of link-level anomalies and graph representation learning for identifying anomalous links in these graphs. First, we introduce a fine-grain taxonomy for edge-level anomalies leveraging structural, temporal, and contextual graph properties. We present a method for generating and injecting such typed anomalies into graphs. Next, we introduce a novel method to generate continuous-time dynamic graphs with consistent patterns across time, structure, and context. To allow temporal graph methods to learn the link anomaly detection task, we extend the generic link prediction setting by: (1) conditioning link existence on contextual edge attributes; and (2) refining the training regime to accommodate diverse perturbations in the negative edge sampler. Building on this, we benchmark methods for anomaly detection. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets -- featuring synthetic and labeled organic anomalies and employing six state-of-the-art learning methods -- validate our taxonomy and generation processes for anomalies and benign graphs, as well as our approach to adapting link prediction methods for anomaly detection. Our results further reveal that different learning methods excel in capturing different aspects of graph normality and detecting different types of anomalies. We conclude with a comprehensive list of findings highlighting opportunities for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[ForecastGrapher: Redefining Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18036v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The challenge of effectively learning inter-series correlations for multivariate time series forecasting remains a substantial and unresolved problem. Traditional deep learning models, which are largely dependent on the Transformer paradigm for modeling long sequences, often fail to integrate information from multiple time series into a coherent and universally applicable model. To bridge this gap, our paper presents ForecastGrapher, a framework reconceptualizes multivariate time series forecasting as a node regression task, providing a unique avenue for capturing the intricate temporal dynamics and inter-series correlations. Our approach is underpinned by three pivotal steps: firstly, generating custom node embeddings to reflect the temporal variations within each series; secondly, constructing an adaptive adjacency matrix to encode the inter-series correlations; and thirdly, augmenting the GNNs' expressive power by diversifying the node feature distribution. To enhance this expressive power, we introduce the Group Feature Convolution GNN (GFC-GNN). This model employs a learnable scaler to segment node features into multiple groups and applies one-dimensional convolutions with different kernel lengths to each group prior to the aggregation phase. Consequently, the GFC-GNN method enriches the diversity of node feature distribution in a fully end-to-end fashion. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, we show that ForecastGrapher surpasses strong baselines and leading published techniques in the domain of multivariate time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |

Recently, studies have focused on enriching these 3D representations with semantic information for downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce RT-GS2, the first generalizable semantic segmentation method employing Gaussian Splatting. While existing Gaussian Splatting-based approaches rely on scene-specific training, RT-GS2 demonstrates the ability to generalize to unseen scenes. Our method adopts a new approach by first extracting view-independent 3D Gaussian features in a self-supervised manner, followed by a novel View-Dependent / View-Independent (VDVI) feature fusion to enhance semantic consistency over different views. Extensive experimentation on three different datasets showcases RT-GS2's superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in semantic segmentation quality, exemplified by a 8.01% increase in mIoU on the Replica dataset. Moreover, our method achieves real-time performance of 27.03 FPS, marking an astonishing 901 times speedup compared to existing approaches. This work represents a significant advancement in the field by introducing, to the best of our knowledge, the first real-time generalizable semantic segmentation method for 3D Gaussian representations of radiance fields.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lower Bounds and Optimal Algorithms for Non-Smooth Convex Decentralized Optimization over Time-Varying Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18031v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the task of minimizing the sum of convex functions stored in a decentralized manner across the nodes of a communication network. This problem is relatively well-studied in the scenario when the objective functions are smooth, or the links of the network are fixed in time, or both. In particular, lower bounds on the number of decentralized communications and (sub)gradient computations required to solve the problem have been established, along with matching optimal algorithms. However, the remaining and most challenging setting of non-smooth decentralized optimization over time-varying networks is largely underexplored, as neither lower bounds nor optimal algorithms are known in the literature. We resolve this fundamental gap with the following contributions: (i) we establish the first lower bounds on the communication and subgradient computation complexities of solving non-smooth convex decentralized optimization problems over time-varying networks; (ii) we develop the first optimal algorithm that matches these lower bounds and offers substantially improved theoretical performance compared to the existing state of the art.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeChara: Evaluating Point-in-Time Character Hallucination of Role-Playing Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18027v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as agents to simulate human behaviors (i.e., role-playing agents), we emphasize the importance of point-in-time role-playing. This situates characters at specific moments in the narrative progression for three main reasons: (i) enhancing users' narrative immersion, (ii) avoiding spoilers, and (iii) fostering engagement in fandom role-playing. To accurately represent characters at specific time points, agents must avoid character hallucination, where they display knowledge that contradicts their characters' identities and historical timelines. We introduce TimeChara, a new benchmark designed to evaluate point-in-time character hallucination in role-playing LLMs. Comprising 10,895 instances generated through an automated pipeline, this benchmark reveals significant hallucination issues in current state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o). To counter this challenge, we propose Narrative-Experts, a method that decomposes the reasoning steps and utilizes narrative experts to reduce point-in-time character hallucinations effectively. Still, our findings with TimeChara highlight the ongoing challenges of point-in-time character hallucination, calling for further study.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2024 Findings.

For dynamic graph modeling, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a mainstream technique, which are generally pre-trained on the link prediction task, leaving a significant gap from the objectives of downstream tasks such as node classification. To bridge the gap, prompt-based learning has gained traction on graphs. However, existing efforts focus on static graphs, neglecting the evolution of dynamic graphs. In this paper, we propose DyGPrompt, a novel pre-training and prompting framework for dynamic graph modeling. First, we design dual prompts to address the gap in both task objectives and dynamic variations across pre-training and downstream tasks. Second, we recognize that node and time features mutually characterize each other, and propose dual condition-nets to model the evolving node-time patterns in downstream tasks. Finally, we thoroughly evaluate and analyze DyGPrompt through extensive experiments on three public datasets.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Controllable Continual Test-Time Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14602v3)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) is an emerging and challenging task where a model trained in a source domain must adapt to continuously changing conditions during testing, without access to the original source data. CTTA is prone to error accumulation due to uncontrollable domain shifts, leading to blurred decision boundaries between categories. Existing CTTA methods primarily focus on suppressing domain shifts, which proves inadequate during the unsupervised test phase. In contrast, we introduce a novel approach that guides rather than suppresses these shifts. Specifically, we propose $\textbf{C}$ontrollable $\textbf{Co}$ntinual $\textbf{T}$est-$\textbf{T}$ime $\textbf{A}$daptation (C-CoTTA), which explicitly prevents any single category from encroaching on others, thereby mitigating the mutual influence between categories caused by uncontrollable shifts. Moreover, our method reduces the sensitivity of model to domain transformations, thereby minimizing the magnitude of category shifts. Extensive quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, while qualitative analyses, such as t-SNE plots, confirm the theoretical validity of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Matroid Semi-Bandits in Sublinear Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17968v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the matroid semi-bandits problem, where at each round the learner plays a subset of $K$ arms from a feasible set, and the goal is to maximize the expected cumulative linear rewards. Existing algorithms have per-round time complexity at least $\Omega(K)$, which becomes expensive when $K$ is large. To address this computational issue, we propose FasterCUCB whose sampling rule takes time sublinear in $K$ for common classes of matroids: $O(D\text{ polylog}(K)\text{ polylog}(T))$ for uniform matroids, partition matroids, and graphical matroids, and $O(D\sqrt{K}\text{ polylog}(T))$ for transversal matroids. Here, $D$ is the maximum number of elements in any feasible subset of arms, and $T$ is the horizon. Our technique is based on dynamic maintenance of an approximate maximum-weight basis over inner-product weights. Although the introduction of an approximate maximum-weight basis presents a challenge in regret analysis, we can still guarantee an upper bound on regret as tight as CUCB in the sense that it matches the gap-dependent lower bound by Kveton et al. (2014a) asymptotically.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Time Series Processing for Transformers and State-Space Models through Token Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17951v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer architectures have shown promising results in time series processing. However, despite recent advances in subquadratic attention mechanisms or state-space models, processing very long sequences still imposes significant computational requirements. Token merging, which involves replacing multiple tokens with a single one calculated as their linear combination, has shown to considerably improve the throughput of vision transformer architectures while maintaining accuracy. In this work, we go beyond computer vision and perform the first investigations of token merging in time series analysis on both time series transformers and state-space models. To effectively scale token merging to long sequences, we introduce local merging, a domain-specific token merging algorithm that selectively combines tokens within a local neighborhood, adjusting the computational complexity from linear to quadratic based on the neighborhood size. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that token merging offers substantial computational benefits with minimal impact on accuracy across various models and datasets. On the recently proposed Chronos foundation model, we achieve accelerations up to 5400% with only minor accuracy degradations.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages in total, 14 figures</p></details> |

This paper examines the banana tree data structure, specifically designed to efficiently maintain persistent homology -- a multi-scale topological descriptor -- for dynamically changing time series data. We implement this data structure and conduct an experimental study to assess its properties and runtime for update operations. Our findings indicate that banana trees are highly effective with unbiased random data, outperforming state-of-the-art static algorithms in these scenarios. Additionally, our results show that real-world time series share structural properties with unbiased random walks, suggesting potential practical utility for our implementation.</p></details> |  |

This research studies the impacts of cobot collaboration using an experimental setup. 120 participants realized a simple and a complex assembly task. 50% collaborated with another human (H/H) and 50% with a cobot (H/C). The workload and the acceptability of the cobotic collaboration were measured. Working with a cobot decreases the effect of the task complexity on the human workload and on the output quality. However, it increases the time completion and the number of gestures (while decreasing their frequency). The H/C couples have a higher chance of success but they take more time and more gestures to realize the task. The results of this research could help developers and stakeholders to understand the impacts of implementing a cobot in production chains.</p></details> |  |

Addressing this safety concern, our project harnesses the analytical power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with a particular emphasis on the well-established models VGG16 and VGG19. These models are acclaimed for their precision in image recognition and are meticulously tested for their ability to detect nuances in driver behavior under varying environmental conditions. Through a comparative analysis against an array of CNN architectures, this study seeks to identify the most efficient model for real-time detection of driver distractions. The ultimate aim is to incorporate the findings into vehicle safety systems, significantly boosting their capability to prevent accidents triggered by inattention. This research not only enhances our understanding of automotive safety technologies but also marks a pivotal step towards creating vehicles that are intuitively aligned with driver behaviors, ensuring safer roads for all.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis reduces sample size requirements and expedites time-to-efficacy signals in advanced cancer clinical trials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02529v3)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis is limited to single unidirectional endpoints, most advanced cancer randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are powered for either progression free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS). This discards efficacy information carried by partial responses, complete responses, and stable disease that frequently precede progressive disease and death. Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis (CWTA) is a generalization of KM that simultaneously assesses multiple rank-ordered endpoints. We hypothesized that CWTA could use this efficacy information to reduce sample size requirements and expedite efficacy signals in advanced cancer trials. We performed 100-fold and 1000-fold simulations of solid tumour systemic therapy RCTs with health statuses rank ordered from complete response (Stage 0) to death (Stage 4). At increments of sample size and hazard ratio, we compared KM PFS and OS with CWTA for (i) sample size requirements to achieve a power of 0.8 and (ii) time-to-first significant efficacy signal. CWTA consistently demonstrated greater power, and reduced sample size requirements by 18% to 35% compared to KM PFS and 14% to 20% compared to KM OS. CWTA also expedited time-to-efficacy signals 2- to 6-fold. CWTA, by incorporating all efficacy signals in the cancer treatment trajectory, provides clinically relevant reduction in required sample size and meaningfully expedites the efficacy signals of cancer treatments compared to KM PFS and KM OS. Using CWTA rather than KM as the primary trial outcome has the potential to meaningfully reduce the numbers of patients, trial duration, and costs to evaluate therapies in advanced cancer.</p></details> |  |

However, they suffer from a large model size and high latency at test-time, which limits the scalability needed for low-resource devices and real-time applications. To resolve these computational issues, we propose Density-Softmax, a sampling-free deterministic framework via combining a density function built on a Lipschitz-constrained feature extractor with the softmax layer. Theoretically, we show that our model is the solution of minimax uncertainty risk and is distance-aware on feature space, thus reducing the over-confidence of the standard softmax under distribution shifts. Empirically, our method enjoys competitive results with state-of-the-art techniques in terms of uncertainty and robustness, while having a lower number of model parameters and a lower latency at test-time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Machine Learning, 2024</p></details> |
| **[PDMLP: Patch-based Decomposed MLP for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13575v2)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have attempted to refine the Transformer architecture to demonstrate its effectiveness in Long-Term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) tasks. Despite surpassing many linear forecasting models with ever-improving performance, we remain skeptical of Transformers as a solution for LTSF. We attribute the effectiveness of these models largely to the adopted Patch mechanism, which enhances sequence locality to an extent yet fails to fully address the loss of temporal information inherent to the permutation-invariant self-attention mechanism. Further investigation suggests that simple linear layers augmented with the Patch mechanism may outperform complex Transformer-based LTSF models. Moreover, diverging from models that use channel independence, our research underscores the importance of cross-variable interactions in enhancing the performance of multivariate time series forecasting. The interaction information between variables is highly valuable but has been misapplied in past studies, leading to suboptimal cross-variable models. Based on these insights, we propose a novel and simple Patch-based Decomposed MLP (PDMLP) for LTSF tasks. Specifically, we employ simple moving averages to extract smooth components and noise-containing residuals from time series data, engaging in semantic information interchange through channel mixing and specializing in random noise with channel independence processing. The PDMLP model consistently achieves state-of-the-art results on several real-world datasets. We hope this surprising finding will spur new research directions in the LTSF field and pave the way for more efficient and concise solutions.</p></details> |  |

Our approach is to obtain the integer factorization of each number. This is the subexponential step. We then form a matrix with the exponents of the primes and propose a novel procedure which modifies the given numbers in such a way that their integer factorization contains sufficient primes to facilitate the search for the solution to the partition problem, while maintaining a similar product. We show that the required time and memory to run the proposed algorithm is subexponential.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.12555</p></details> |

This time-consuming process causes ED crowding which impacts patient mortality, medical errors, staff burnout, etc. This work proposes (time) cost-effective diagnostic assistance that leverages artificial intelligence systems to help ED clinicians make efficient and accurate diagnoses. In collaboration with ED clinicians, we use public patient data to curate MIMIC-ED-Assist, a benchmark for AI systems to suggest laboratory tests that minimize wait time while accurately predicting critical outcomes such as death. With MIMIC-ED-Assist, we develop ED-Copilot which sequentially suggests patient-specific laboratory tests and makes diagnostic predictions. ED-Copilot employs a pre-trained bio-medical language model to encode patient information and uses reinforcement learning to minimize ED wait time and maximize prediction accuracy. On MIMIC-ED-Assist, ED-Copilot improves prediction accuracy over baselines while halving average wait time from four hours to two hours. ED-Copilot can also effectively personalize treatment recommendations based on patient severity, further highlighting its potential as a diagnostic assistant. Since MIMIC-ED-Assist is a retrospective benchmark, ED-Copilot is restricted to recommend only observed tests. We show ED-Copilot achieves competitive performance without this restriction as the maximum allowed time increases. Our code is available at https://github.com/cxcscmu/ED-Copilot.</p></details> |  |

In reality, however, ship arrival times are affected by various external factors, which can cause the order of container retrieval to be different from the initial plan. To represent such uncertainty, we generate multiple scenarios from a multivariate probability distribution of ship arrival times. We derive a mixed-integer linear optimization model to find an optimal container layout such that the conditional value-at-risk is minimized for the number of misplaced containers responsible for reshuffles. Moreover, we devise an exact algorithm based on the cutting-plane method to handle large-scale problems. Numerical experiments using synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method can produce high-quality container layouts compared with the conventional robust optimization model. Additionally, our algorithm can speed up the computation of solving large-scale problems.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a novel speed-up method for diffusion model training, called, which is based on a closer look at time steps. Our key findings are: i) Time steps can be empirically divided into acceleration, deceleration, and convergence areas based on the process increment. ii) These time steps are imbalanced, with many concentrated in the convergence area. iii) The concentrated steps provide limited benefits for diffusion training. To address this, we design an asymmetric sampling strategy that reduces the frequency of steps from the convergence area while increasing the sampling probability for steps from other areas. Additionally, we propose a weighting strategy to emphasize the importance of time steps with rapid-change process increments. As a plug-and-play and architecture-agnostic approach, SpeeD consistently achieves 3-times acceleration across various diffusion architectures, datasets, and tasks. Notably, due to its simple design, our approach significantly reduces the cost of diffusion model training with minimal overhead. Our research enables more researchers to train diffusion models at a lower cost.</p></details> |  |

Our overall accuracy is comparable to ray tracing-based EM simulation, as evidenced by lower mean squared error values. Furthermore, our GAN-based method drastically reduces the computation time, achieving a 5X speedup on complex benchmarks. In practice, it can compute the signal strength in a few milliseconds on any location in 3D indoor environments. We also present a large dataset of 3D models and EM ray tracing-simulated heatmaps. To the best of our knowledge, EM-GANSim is the first real-time algorithm for EM simulation in complex 3D indoor environments.

| **[Test-Time Adaptation for Depth Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03312v4)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is common to observe performance degradation when transferring models trained on some (source) datasets to target testing data due to a domain gap between them. Existing methods for bridging this gap, such as domain adaptation (DA), may require the source data on which the model was trained (often not available), while others, i.e., source-free DA, require many passes through the testing data. We propose an online test-time adaptation method for depth completion, the task of inferring a dense depth map from a single image and associated sparse depth map, that closes the performance gap in a single pass. We first present a study on how the domain shift in each data modality affects model performance. Based on our observations that the sparse depth modality exhibits a much smaller covariate shift than the image, we design an embedding module trained in the source domain that preserves a mapping from features encoding only sparse depth to those encoding image and sparse depth. During test time, sparse depth features are projected using this map as a proxy for source domain features and are used as guidance to train a set of auxiliary parameters (i.e., adaptation layer) to align image and sparse depth features from the target test domain to that of the source domain. We evaluate our method on indoor and outdoor scenarios and show that it improves over baselines by an average of 21.1%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditioning on Time is All You Need for Synthetic Survival Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17333v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic data generation holds considerable promise, offering avenues to enhance privacy, fairness, and data accessibility. Despite the availability of various methods for generating synthetic tabular data, challenges persist, particularly in specialized applications such as survival analysis. One significant obstacle in survival data generation is censoring, which manifests as not knowing the precise timing of observed (target) events for certain instances. Existing methods face difficulties in accurately reproducing the real distribution of event times for both observed (uncensored) events and censored events, i.e., the generated event-time distributions do not accurately match the underlying distributions of the real data. So motivated, we propose a simple paradigm to produce synthetic survival data by generating covariates conditioned on event times (and censoring indicators), thus allowing one to reuse existing conditional generative models for tabular data without significant computational overhead, and without making assumptions about the (usually unknown) generation mechanism underlying censoring. We evaluate this method via extensive experiments on real-world datasets. Our methodology outperforms multiple competitive baselines at generating survival data, while improving the performance of downstream survival models trained on it and tested on real data.</p></details> |  |

Models for time series imputation often require specialization, necessitating distinct designs for different domains and missing patterns. In this study, we introduce NuwaTS, a framework to repurpose Pre-trained Language Model (PLM) for general time series imputation. Once trained, this model can be applied to imputation tasks on incomplete time series from any domain with any missing patterns. We begin by devising specific embeddings for each sub-series patch of the incomplete time series. These embeddings encapsulate information about the patch itself, the missing data patterns within the patch, and the patch's statistical characteristics. To enhance the model's adaptability to different missing patterns, we propose a contrastive learning approach to make representations of the same patch more similar across different missing patterns. By combining this contrastive loss with the missing data imputation task, we train PLMs to obtain a one-for-all imputation model. Furthermore, we utilize a plug-and-play layer-wise fine-tuning approach to train domain-specific models. Experimental results demonstrate that leveraging a dataset of over seventeen million time series from diverse domains, we obtain a one-for-all imputation model which outperforms existing domain-specific models across various datasets and missing patterns. Additionally, we find that NuwaTS can be generalized to other time series tasks such as forecasting. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Chengyui/NuwaTS.</p></details> | 22 pages, 13 figures |

However, calibrating stereo vision systems that incorporate both event and frame-based cameras remains a significant challenge. In this letter, we present EF-Calib, a spatiotemporal calibration framework for event- and frame-based cameras using continuous-time trajectories. A novel calibration pattern applicable to both camera types and the corresponding event recognition algorithm is proposed. Leveraging the asynchronous nature of events, a derivable piece-wise B-spline to represent camera pose continuously is introduced, enabling calibration for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset, with analytical Jacobians provided. Various experiments are carried out to evaluate the calibration performance of EF-Calib, including calibration experiments for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset. Experimental results show that EF-Calib achieves the most accurate intrinsic parameters compared to current SOTA, the close accuracy of the extrinsic parameters compared to the frame-based results, and accurate time offset estimation. EF-Calib provides a convenient and accurate toolbox for calibrating the system that fuses events and frames.

However, these methods often rely on supervised learning, which does not fully account for the sparsity and locality of patterns in time series data (e.g., diseases-related anomalous points in ECG). To address this challenge, we formally reformulate MTSC as a weakly supervised problem, introducing a novel multiple-instance learning (MIL) framework for better localization of patterns of interest and modeling time dependencies within time series. Our novel approach, TimeMIL, formulates the temporal correlation and ordering within a time-aware MIL pooling, leveraging a tokenized transformer with a specialized learnable wavelet positional token. The proposed method surpassed 26 recent state-of-the-art methods, underscoring the effectiveness of the weakly supervised TimeMIL in MTSC.

| **[Exploring the Performance of Continuous-Time Dynamic Link Prediction Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17182v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic Link Prediction (DLP) addresses the prediction of future links in evolving networks. However, accurately portraying the performance of DLP algorithms poses challenges that might impede progress in the field. Importantly, common evaluation pipelines usually calculate ranking or binary classification metrics, where the scores of observed interactions (positives) are compared with those of randomly generated ones (negatives). However, a single metric is not sufficient to fully capture the differences between DLP algorithms, and is prone to overly optimistic performance evaluation. Instead, an in-depth evaluation should reflect performance variations across different nodes, edges, and time segments. In this work, we contribute tools to perform such a comprehensive evaluation. (1) We propose Birth-Death diagrams, a simple but powerful visualization technique that illustrates the effect of time-based train-test splitting on the difficulty of DLP on a given dataset. (2) We describe an exhaustive taxonomy of negative sampling methods that can be used at evaluation time. (3) We carry out an empirical study of the effect of the different negative sampling strategies. Our comparison between heuristics and state-of-the-art memory-based methods on various real-world datasets confirms a strong effect of using different negative sampling strategies on the test Area Under the Curve (AUC). Moreover, we conduct a visual exploration of the prediction, with additional insights on which different types of errors are prominent over time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Prediction Regions for time-series models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12234v2)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Learning algorithms are notorious for providing point predictions but not prediction intervals. There are many applications where one requires confidence in predictions and prediction intervals. Stringing together, these intervals give rise to joint prediction regions with the desired significance level. It is an easy task to compute Joint Prediction regions (JPR) when the data is IID. However, the task becomes overly difficult when JPR is needed for time series because of the dependence between the observations. This project aims to implement Wolf and Wunderli's method for constructing JPRs and compare it with other methods (e.g. NP heuristic, Joint Marginals). The method under study is based on bootstrapping and is applied to different datasets (Min Temp, Sunspots), using different predictors (e.g. ARIMA and LSTM). One challenge of applying the method under study is to derive prediction standard errors for models, it cannot be obtained analytically. A novel method to estimate prediction standard error for different predictors is also devised. Finally, the method is applied to a synthetic dataset to find empirical averages and empirical widths and the results from the Wolf and Wunderli paper are consolidated. The experimental results show a narrowing of width with strong predictors like neural nets, widening of width with increasing forecast horizon H and decreasing significance level alpha, controlling the width with parameter k in K-FWE, and loss of information using Joint Marginals.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is a Master Thesis</p></details> |
| **[BeamVQ: Aligning Space-Time Forecasting Model via Self-training on Physics-aware Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17051v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven deep learning has emerged as the new paradigm to model complex physical space-time systems. These data-driven methods learn patterns by optimizing statistical metrics and tend to overlook the adherence to physical laws, unlike traditional model-driven numerical methods. Thus, they often generate predictions that are not physically realistic. On the other hand, by sampling a large amount of high quality predictions from a data-driven model, some predictions will be more physically plausible than the others and closer to what will happen in the future. Based on this observation, we propose \emph{Beam search by Vector Quantization} (BeamVQ) to enhance the physical alignment of data-driven space-time forecasting models. The key of BeamVQ is to train model on self-generated samples filtered with physics-aware metrics. To be flexibly support different backbone architectures, BeamVQ leverages a code bank to transform any encoder-decoder model to the continuous state space into discrete codes. Afterwards, it iteratively employs beam search to sample high-quality sequences, retains those with the highest physics-aware scores, and trains model on the new dataset. Comprehensive experiments show that BeamVQ not only gave an average statistical skill score boost for more than 32% for ten backbones on five datasets, but also significantly enhances physics-aware metrics.</p></details> |  |

We create an environment to emulate different networking topologies that include multiple cloud or edge sites scenarios, and conduct a set of tests to compare the application response times via ClusterLink to direct communications in relation to node distances and request/response payload size. Our results show that, in an edge context, ClusterLink does not introduce a significant processing overhead to the communication for small payloads as compared to cloud. For higher payloads and on comparably more aged consumer hardware, ClusterLink version 0.2 introduces communication overhead relative to the delay experienced on the link.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IECCONT workshop co-hosted with Euro-Par 2024 https://2024.euro-par.org/workshops/workshops/</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce FLANDERS, a novel pre-aggregation filter for FL resilient to large-scale model poisoning attacks, i.e., when malicious clients far exceed legitimate participants. FLANDERS treats the sequence of local models sent by clients in each FL round as a matrix-valued time series. Then, it identifies malicious client updates as outliers in this time series by comparing actual observations with estimates generated by a matrix autoregressive forecasting model maintained by the server. Experiments conducted in several non-iid FL setups show that FLANDERS significantly improves robustness across a wide spectrum of attacks when paired with standard and robust existing aggregation methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Elastic Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17516v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce and detail an atypical neural network architecture, called time elastic neural network (teNN), for multivariate time series classification. The novelty compared to classical neural network architecture is that it explicitly incorporates time warping ability, as well as a new way of considering attention. In addition, this architecture is capable of learning a dropout strategy, thus optimizing its own architecture.Behind the design of this architecture, our overall objective is threefold: firstly, we are aiming at improving the accuracy of instance based classification approaches that shows quite good performances as far as enough training data is available. Secondly we seek to reduce the computational complexity inherent to these methods to improve their scalability. Ideally, we seek to find an acceptable balance between these first two criteria. And finally, we seek to enhance the explainability of the decision provided by this kind of neural architecture.The experiment demonstrates that the stochastic gradient descent implemented to train a teNN is quite effective. To the extent that the selection of some critical meta-parameters is correct, convergence is generally smooth and fast.While maintaining good accuracy, we get a drastic gain in scalability by first reducing the required number of reference time series, i.e. the number of teNN cells required. Secondly, we demonstrate that, during the training process, the teNN succeeds in reducing the number of neurons required within each cell. Finally, we show that the analysis of the activation and attention matrices as well as the reference time series after training provides relevant information to interpret and explain the classification results.The comparative study that we have carried out and which concerns around thirty diverse and multivariate datasets shows that the teNN obtains results comparable to those of the state of the art, in particular similar to those of a network mixing LSTM and CNN architectures for example.</p></details> |  |
| **[Convergence of SGD with momentum in the nonconvex case: A novel time window-based analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16954v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel time window-based analysis technique to investigate the convergence behavior of the stochastic gradient descent method with momentum (SGDM) in nonconvex settings. Despite its popularity, the convergence behavior of SGDM remains less understood in nonconvex scenarios. This is primarily due to the absence of a sufficient descent property and challenges in controlling stochastic errors in an almost sure sense. To address these challenges, we study the behavior of SGDM over specific time windows, rather than examining the descent of consecutive iterates as in traditional analyses. This time window-based approach simplifies the convergence analysis and enables us to establish the first iterate convergence result for SGDM under the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) property. Based on the underlying KL exponent and the utilized step size scheme, we further characterize local convergence rates of SGDM.</p></details> | 28 pages |

Such time series generally capture unknown numbers of states, each with a different duration, that correspond to specific conditions, e.g., "walking" or "running" in human-activity monitoring. Unsupervised identification of such states facilitates storage and processing in subsequent data analyses, as well as enhances result interpretability. Existing state-detection proposals face three challenges. First, they introduce substantial computational overhead, rendering them impractical in resourceconstrained or streaming settings. Second, although state-of-the-art (SOTA) proposals employ contrastive learning for representation, insufficient attention to false negatives hampers model convergence and accuracy. Third, SOTA proposals predominantly only emphasize offline non-streaming deployment, we highlight an urgent need to optimize online streaming scenarios. We propose E2Usd that enables efficient-yet-accurate unsupervised MTS state detection. E2Usd exploits a Fast Fourier Transform-based Time Series Compressor (fftCompress) and a Decomposed Dual-view Embedding Module (ddEM) that together encode input MTSs at low computational overhead. Additionally, we propose a False Negative Cancellation Contrastive Learning method (fnccLearning) to counteract the effects of false negatives and to achieve more cluster-friendly embedding spaces. To reduce computational overhead further in streaming settings, we introduce Adaptive Threshold Detection (adaTD). Comprehensive experiments with six baselines and six datasets offer evidence that E2Usd is capable of SOTA accuracy at significantly reduced computational overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Web Conference 2024 (WWW 2024)</p></details> |

Although Transformer models have dramatically shifted the landscape of forecasting, their effectiveness remains debated. Recent findings have indicated that simpler linear models might outperform complex Transformer-based approaches, highlighting the potential for more streamlined architectures. In this paper, we shift focus from the overall architecture of the Transformer to the effectiveness of self-attentions for time series forecasting. To this end, we introduce a new architecture, Cross-Attention-only Time Series transformer (CATS), that rethinks the traditional Transformer framework by eliminating self-attention and leveraging cross-attention mechanisms instead. By establishing future horizon-dependent parameters as queries and enhanced parameter sharing, our model not only improves long-term forecasting accuracy but also reduces the number of parameters and memory usage. Extensive experiment across various datasets demonstrates that our model achieves superior performance with the lowest mean squared error and uses fewer parameters compared to existing models.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 14 figures, 13 tables.

Surround Radar/Lidar can provide 360-degree view sampling with the minimal cost, which are promising sensing hardware solutions for autonomous driving systems. However, due to the intrinsic physical constraints, the rotating speed of surround Radar, and thus the frequency to generate Radar data frames, is much lower than surround Lidar. Existing Radar/Lidar fusion methods have to work at the low frequency of surround Radar, which cannot meet the high responsiveness requirement of autonomous driving systems.This paper develops techniques to fuse surround Radar/Lidar with working frequency only limited by the faster surround Lidar instead of the slower surround Radar, based on the state-of-the-art object detection model MVDNet. The basic idea of our approach is simple: we let MVDNet work with temporally unaligned data from Radar/Lidar, so that fusion can take place at any time when a new Lidar data frame arrives, instead of waiting for the slow Radar data frame. However, directly applying MVDNet to temporally unaligned Radar/Lidar data greatly degrades its object detection accuracy. The key information revealed in this paper is that we can achieve high output frequency with little accuracy loss by enhancing the training procedure to explore the temporal redundancy in MVDNet so that it can tolerate the temporal unalignment of input data. We explore several different ways of training enhancement and compare them quantitatively with experiments.</p></details> |  |

Recently, neural network-based VADs have alleviated the degradation of performance to some extent. However, the majority of existing studies have employed excessively large models and incorporated future context, while neglecting to evaluate the operational efficiency and latency of the models. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and real-time neural network called MagicNet, which utilizes casual and depth separable 1-D convolutions and GRU. Without relying on future features as input, our proposed model is compared with two state-of-the-art algorithms on synthesized in-domain and out-domain test datasets. The evaluation results demonstrate that MagicNet can achieve improved performance and robustness with fewer parameter costs.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, a new time-dependent complex variable solution on quasi three-dimensional shallow tunnelling in gravitational geomaterial is derived, and the far-field displacement singularity is eliminated by fixed far-field ground surface in the whole excavation time span. With an equivalent coefficient of three-dimensional effect, the quasi three-dimensional shallow tunnelling is transformed into a plane strain problem with time-dependent virtual traction along tunnel periphery. The mixed boundaries of fixed far-field ground surface and nearby free segment form a homogenerous Riemann-Hilbert problem with extra constraints of the virtual traction along tunnel periphery, which is simultaneously solved using an iterative linear system with good numerical stability. The mixed boundary conditions along the ground surface in the whole excavation time span are well satisified in a numerical case, which is further examined by comparing with corresponding finite element solution. The results are in good agreements, and the proposed solution illustrates high efficiency. More discussions are made on excavation rate, viscosity, and solution convergence.

Recently, Banno et al. (CAV'22) proposed a protocol for online LTL monitoring that keeps data concealed from the server using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). We build on this protocol to allow arithmetic operations over encrypted values, e.g., to compute a safety measurement combining distance, velocity, and so forth. Overall, our protocol enables oblivious online monitoring of discrete-time real-valued signals against signal temporal logic (STL) formulas. Our protocol combines two FHE schemes, CKKS and TFHE, leveraging their respective strengths. We employ CKKS to evaluate arithmetic predicates in STL formulas while utilizing TFHE to process them using a DFA derived from the STL formula. We conducted case studies on monitoring blood glucose levels and vehicles' behavior against the Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) rules. Our results suggest the practical relevance of our protocol.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Law for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15124v2)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling law that rewards large datasets, complex models and enhanced data granularity has been observed in various fields of deep learning. Yet, studies on time series forecasting have cast doubt on scaling behaviors of deep learning methods for time series forecasting: while more training data improves performance, more capable models do not always outperform less capable models, and longer input horizons may hurt performance for some models. We propose a theory for scaling law for time series forecasting that can explain these seemingly abnormal behaviors. We take into account the impact of dataset size and model complexity, as well as time series data granularity, particularly focusing on the look-back horizon, an aspect that has been unexplored in previous theories. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate various models using a diverse set of time series forecasting datasets, which (1) verifies the validity of scaling law on dataset size and model complexity within the realm of time series forecasting, and (2) validates our theoretical framework, particularly regarding the influence of look back horizon. We hope our findings may inspire new models targeting time series forecasting datasets of limited size, as well as large foundational datasets and models for time series forecasting in future works.\footnote{Codes for our experiments will be made public at: \url{https://github.com/JingzheShi/ScalingLawForTimeSeriesForecasting}.</p></details> | 20 pages |

| **[Scalable Numerical Embeddings for Multivariate Time Series: Enhancing Healthcare Data Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16557v1)** | 2024-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series (MTS) data, when sampled irregularly and asynchronously, often present extensive missing values. Conventional methodologies for MTS analysis tend to rely on temporal embeddings based on timestamps that necessitate subsequent imputations, yet these imputed values frequently deviate substantially from their actual counterparts, thereby compromising prediction accuracy. Furthermore, these methods typically fail to provide robust initial embeddings for values infrequently observed or even absent within the training set, posing significant challenges to model generalizability. In response to these challenges, we propose SCAlable Numerical Embedding (SCANE), a novel framework that treats each feature value as an independent token, effectively bypassing the need for imputation. SCANE regularizes the traits of distinct feature embeddings and enhances representational learning through a scalable embedding mechanism. Coupling SCANE with the Transformer Encoder architecture, we develop the Scalable nUMerical eMbeddIng Transformer (SUMMIT), which is engineered to deliver precise predictive outputs for MTS characterized by prevalent missing entries. Our experimental validation, conducted across three disparate electronic health record (EHR) datasets marked by elevated missing value frequencies, confirms the superior performance of SUMMIT over contemporary state-of-the-art approaches addressing similar challenges. These results substantiate the efficacy of SCANE and SUMMIT, underscoring their potential applicability across a broad spectrum of MTS data analytical tasks.</p></details> |  |

Existing CTDGNs are effective for modeling temporal graph data due to their ability to capture complex temporal dependencies but perform poorly on LTF due to the substantial requirement for historical data, which is not practical in most cases. To relieve this problem, a most intuitive way is data augmentation. In this study, we propose \textbf{\underline{U}ncertainty \underline{M}asked \underline{M}ix\underline{U}p (UmmU)}: a plug-and-play module that conducts uncertainty estimation to introduce uncertainty into the embedding of intermediate layer of CTDGNs, and perform masked mixup to further enhance the uncertainty of the embedding to make it generalize to more situations. UmmU can be easily inserted into arbitrary CTDGNs without increasing the number of parameters. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three real-world dynamic graph datasets, the results demonstrate that UmmU can effectively improve the long-term forecasting performance for CTDGNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Recen...</summary><p>Recent evidence has emerged that directly contradicts the main findings of our paper, particularly those in Section 4.

| **[Decomposing the Neurons: Activation Sparsity via Mixture of Experts for Continual Test Time Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16486v1)** | 2024-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA), which aims to adapt the pre-trained model to ever-evolving target domains, emerges as an important task for vision models. As current vision models appear to be heavily biased towards texture, continuously adapting the model from one domain distribution to another can result in serious catastrophic forgetting. Drawing inspiration from the human visual system's adeptness at processing both shape and texture according to the famous Trichromatic Theory, we explore the integration of a Mixture-of-Activation-Sparsity-Experts (MoASE) as an adapter for the CTTA task. Given the distinct reaction of neurons with low/high activation to domain-specific/agnostic features, MoASE decomposes the neural activation into high-activation and low-activation components with a non-differentiable Spatial Differentiate Dropout (SDD). Based on the decomposition, we devise a multi-gate structure comprising a Domain-Aware Gate (DAG) that utilizes domain information to adaptive combine experts that process the post-SDD sparse activations of different strengths, and the Activation Sparsity Gate (ASG) that adaptively assigned feature selection threshold of the SDD for different experts for more precise feature decomposition. Finally, we introduce a Homeostatic-Proximal (HP) loss to bypass the error accumulation problem when continuously adapting the model. Extensive experiments on four prominent benchmarks substantiate that our methodology achieves state-of-the-art performance in both classification and segmentation CTTA tasks. Our code is now available at https://github.com/RoyZry98/MoASE-Pytorch.</p></details> |  |

Existing frequency-domain augmentations disturb the original data with various full-spectrum noises, leading to excess domain gap between augmented and original data. Although impressive performance has been achieved in certain cases, frequency-domain DA has yet to be generalized to time series prediction datasets. In this paper, we found that frequency-domain augmentations can be significantly improved by two modifications that limit the perturbations. First, we found that limiting the perturbation to only dominant frequencies significantly outperforms full-spectrum perturbations. Dominant fre quencies represent the main periodicity and trends of the signal and are more important than other frequencies. Second, we found that simply shuffling the dominant frequency components is superior over sophisticated designed random perturbations. Shuffle rearranges the original components (magnitudes and phases) and limits the external noise. With these two modifications, we proposed dominant shuffle, a simple yet effective data augmentation for time series prediction. Our method is very simple yet powerful and can be implemented with just a few lines of code. Extensive experiments with eight datasets and six popular time series models demonstrate that our method consistently improves the baseline performance under various settings and significantly outperforms other DA methods.

A recent model, Mamba, based on selective state space models (SSMs), has emerged as a competitive alternative to Transformer, offering comparable performance with higher throughput and linear complexity related to sequence length. In this study, we analyze the limitations of current Mamba in LTSF and propose four targeted improvements, leading to MambaTS. We first introduce variable scan along time to arrange the historical information of all the variables together. We suggest that causal convolution in Mamba is not necessary for LTSF and propose the Temporal Mamba Block (TMB). We further incorporate a dropout mechanism for selective parameters of TMB to mitigate model overfitting. Moreover, we tackle the issue of variable scan order sensitivity by introducing variable permutation training. We further propose variable-aware scan along time to dynamically discover variable relationships during training and decode the optimal variable scan order by solving the shortest path visiting all nodes problem during inference. Extensive experiments conducted on eight public datasets demonstrate that MambaTS achieves new state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

These models approximate continuous systems using a set of basis functions and discretize them to handle input data, making them well-suited for modeling time series data collected at specific frequencies from continuous systems. Despite its potential, the application of SSMs in time series forecasting remains underexplored, with most existing models treating SSMs as a black box for capturing temporal or channel dependencies. To address this gap, this paper proposes a novel theoretical framework termed Dynamic Spectral Operator, offering more intuitive and general guidance on applying SSMs to time series data.

Test-time adaptation has proven its effectiveness in tackling the cross-domain distribution shift during inference. However, most existing methods achieve adaptation by updating the pre-trained models, rendering them susceptible to error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting when encountering a series of distribution shifts (i.e., under the continual test-time adaptation setup). To overcome these challenges caused by updating the models, in this paper, we freeze the pre-trained model and propose the Visual Prompt-based Test-Time Adaptation (VPTTA) method to train a specific prompt for each test image to align the statistics in the batch normalization layers. Specifically, we present the low-frequency prompt, which is lightweight with only a few parameters and can be effectively trained in a single iteration. To enhance prompt initialization, we equip VPTTA with a memory bank to benefit the current prompt from previous ones. Additionally, we design a warm-up mechanism, which mixes source and target statistics to construct warm-up statistics, thereby facilitating the training process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our VPTTA over other state-of-the-art methods on two medical image segmentation benchmark tasks. The code and weights of pre-trained source models are available at https://github.com/Chen-Ziyang/VPTTA.</p></details> |  |

However, these approaches often rest on the assumption that data distributions conform to Gaussian models, overlooking the diversity of patterns that can manifest in both normal and abnormal states, thereby diminishing discriminative performance. Our innovation addresses this limitation by introducing a combination of data augmentation and soft contrastive learning, specifically designed to capture the multifaceted nature of state behaviors more accurately. The data augmentation process enriches the dataset with varied representations of normal states, while soft contrastive learning fine-tunes the model's sensitivity to the subtle differences between normal and abnormal patterns, enabling it to recognize a broader spectrum of anomalies. This dual strategy significantly boosts the model's ability to distinguish between normal and abnormal states, leading to a marked improvement in fault detection performance across multiple datasets and settings, thereby setting a new benchmark for unsupervised fault detection in complex systems.

While recent efforts are focused on building such FMs by unlocking the potential of language models (LMs) for time series analysis, dedicated parameters for various downstream forecasting tasks need training, which hinders the common knowledge sharing across domains. Moreover, data owners may hesitate to share the access to local data due to privacy concerns and copyright protection, which makes it impossible to simply construct a FM on cross-domain training instances. To address these issues, we propose Time-FFM, a Federated Foundation Model for Time series forecasting by leveraging pretrained LMs. Specifically, we begin by transforming time series into the modality of text tokens. To bootstrap LMs for time series reasoning, we propose a prompt adaption module to determine domain-customized prompts dynamically instead of artificially. Given the data heterogeneity across domains, we design a personalized federated training strategy by learning global encoders and local prediction heads. Our comprehensive experiments indicate that Time-FFM outperforms state-of-the-arts and promises effective few-shot and zero-shot forecaster.</p></details> |  |

However, this is a nontrivial problem and poses two critical challenges: sparse spatio-temporal correlation between audio-video pairs and multimodal correlation overwriting that forgets audio-video relations. To tackle this problem, we propose a new continual audio-video pre-training method with two novel ideas: (1) Localized Patch Importance Scoring: we introduce a multimodal encoder to determine the importance score for each patch, emphasizing semantically intertwined audio-video patches. (2) Replay-guided Correlation Assessment: to reduce the corruption of previously learned audiovisual knowledge due to drift, we propose to assess the correlation of the current patches on the past steps to identify the patches exhibiting high correlations with the past steps. Based on the results from the two ideas, we perform probabilistic patch selection for effective continual audio-video pre-training. Experimental validation on multiple benchmarks shows that our method achieves a 3.69%p of relative performance gain in zero-shot retrieval tasks compared to strong continual learning baselines, while reducing memory consumption by ~45%.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |
| **[A Unified Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning Model Towards Interpolation and Extrapolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18106v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal knowledge graph (TKG) reasoning has two settings: interpolation reasoning and extrapolation reasoning. Both of them draw plenty of research interest and have great significance. Methods of the former de-emphasize the temporal correlations among facts sequences, while methods of the latter require strict chronological order of knowledge and ignore inferring clues provided by missing facts of the past. These limit the practicability of TKG applications as almost all of the existing TKG reasoning methods are designed specifically to address either one setting. To this end, this paper proposes an original Temporal PAth-based Reasoning (TPAR) model for both the interpolation and extrapolation reasoning. TPAR performs a neural-driven symbolic reasoning fashion that is robust to ambiguous and noisy temporal data and with fine interpretability as well. Comprehensive experiments show that TPAR outperforms SOTA methods on the link prediction task for both the interpolation and the extrapolation settings. A novel pipeline experimental setting is designed to evaluate the performances of SOTA combinations and the proposed TPAR towards interpolation and extrapolation reasoning. More diverse experiments are conducted to show the robustness and interpretability of TPAR.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ACL 2024 main conference</p></details> |

While Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have been effective in scene reconstruction, their slow inference speeds and lengthy training durations limit their applicability. To overcome these limitations, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) based methods have emerged as a recent trend, offering rapid inference capabilities and superior 3D quality. However, these methods still struggle with under-reconstruction in both static and dynamic scenes. In this paper, we propose HFGS, a novel approach for deformable endoscopic reconstruction that addresses these challenges from spatial and temporal frequency perspectives. Our approach incorporates deformation fields to better handle dynamic scenes and introduces Spatial High-Frequency Emphasis Reconstruction (SHF) to minimize discrepancies in spatial frequency spectra between the rendered image and its ground truth. Additionally, we introduce Temporal High-Frequency Emphasis Reconstruction (THF) to enhance dynamic awareness in neural rendering by leveraging flow priors, focusing optimization on motion-intensive parts. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate that HFGS achieves superior rendering quality. Our code will be available.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Spanning Training Progress: Temporal Dual-Depth Scoring (TDDS) for Enhanced Dataset Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13613v3)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset pruning aims to construct a coreset capable of achieving performance comparable to the original, full dataset. Most existing dataset pruning methods rely on snapshot-based criteria to identify representative samples, often resulting in poor generalization across various pruning and cross-architecture scenarios. Recent studies have addressed this issue by expanding the scope of training dynamics considered, including factors such as forgetting event and probability change, typically using an averaging approach. However, these works struggle to integrate a broader range of training dynamics without overlooking well-generalized samples, which may not be sufficiently highlighted in an averaging manner. In this study, we propose a novel dataset pruning method termed as Temporal Dual-Depth Scoring (TDDS), to tackle this problem. TDDS utilizes a dual-depth strategy to achieve a balance between incorporating extensive training dynamics and identifying representative samples for dataset pruning. In the first depth, we estimate the series of each sample's individual contributions spanning the training progress, ensuring comprehensive integration of training dynamics. In the second depth, we focus on the variability of the sample-wise contributions identified in the first depth to highlight well-generalized samples. Extensive experiments conducted on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets verify the superiority of TDDS over previous SOTA methods. Specifically on CIFAR-100, our method achieves 54.51% accuracy with only 10% training data, surpassing random selection by 7.83% and other comparison methods by at least 12.69%.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2024 |
| **[On Robust Clustering of Temporal Point Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17828v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clustering of event stream data is of great importance in many application scenarios, including but not limited to, e-commerce, electronic health, online testing, mobile music service, etc. Existing clustering algorithms fail to take outlier data into consideration and are implemented without theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we propose a robust temporal point processes clustering framework which works under mild assumptions and meanwhile addresses several important issues in the event stream clustering problem.Specifically, we introduce a computationally efficient model-free distance function to quantify the dissimilarity between different event streams so that the outliers can be detected and the good initial clusters could be obtained. We further consider an expectation-maximization-type algorithm incorporated with a Catoni's influence function for robust estimation and fine-tuning of clusters. We also establish the theoretical results including algorithmic convergence, estimation error bound, outlier detection, etc. Simulation results corroborate our theoretical findings and real data applications show the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAMSGL: Series-Aligned Multi-Scale Graph Learning for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02646v3)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting in various domains, like traffic prediction and weather forecasting, is a challenging endeavor, primarily due to the difficulties in modeling propagation dynamics and capturing high-dimensional interactions among nodes. Despite the significant strides made by graph-based networks in spatio-temporal forecasting, there remain two pivotal factors closely related to forecasting performance that need further consideration: time delays in propagation dynamics and multi-scale high-dimensional interactions. In this work, we present a Series-Aligned Multi-Scale Graph Learning (SAMSGL) framework, aiming to enhance forecasting performance. In order to handle time delays in spatial interactions, we propose a series-aligned graph convolution layer to facilitate the aggregation of non-delayed graph signals, thereby mitigating the influence of time delays for the improvement in accuracy. To understand global and local spatio-temporal interactions, we develop a spatio-temporal architecture via multi-scale graph learning, which encompasses two essential components: multi-scale graph structure learning and graph-fully connected (Graph-FC) blocks. The multi-scale graph structure learning includes a global graph structure to learn both delayed and non-delayed node embeddings, as well as a local one to learn node variations influenced by neighboring factors. The Graph-FC blocks synergistically fuse spatial and temporal information to boost prediction accuracy. To evaluate the performance of SAMSGL, we conduct experiments on meteorological and traffic forecasting datasets, which demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority.</p></details> | Accepted by Chaos |
| **[The surprising efficiency of temporal difference learning for rare event prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17638v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We quantify the efficiency of temporal difference (TD) learning over the direct, or Monte Carlo (MC), estimator for policy evaluation in reinforcement learning, with an emphasis on estimation of quantities related to rare events. Policy evaluation is complicated in the rare event setting by the long timescale of the event and by the need for \emph{relative accuracy} in estimates of very small values. Specifically, we focus on least-squares TD (LSTD) prediction for finite state Markov chains, and show that LSTD can achieve relative accuracy far more efficiently than MC. We prove a central limit theorem for the LSTD estimator and upper bound the \emph{relative asymptotic variance} by simple quantities characterizing the connectivity of states relative to the transition probabilities between them. Using this bound, we show that, even when both the timescale of the rare event and the relative accuracy of the MC estimator are exponentially large in the number of states, LSTD maintains a fixed level of relative accuracy with a total number of observed transitions of the Markov chain that is only \emph{polynomially} large in the number of states.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gaussian Embedding of Temporal Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17253v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representing the nodes of continuous-time temporal graphs in a low-dimensional latent space has wide-ranging applications, from prediction to visualization. Yet, analyzing continuous-time relational data with timestamped interactions introduces unique challenges due to its sparsity. Merely embedding nodes as trajectories in the latent space overlooks this sparsity, emphasizing the need to quantify uncertainty around the latent positions. In this paper, we propose TGNE (\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{G}aussian \textbf{N}etwork \textbf{E}mbedding), an innovative method that bridges two distinct strands of literature: the statistical analysis of networks via Latent Space Models (LSM)\cite{Hoff2002} and temporal graph machine learning. TGNE embeds nodes as piece-wise linear trajectories of Gaussian distributions in the latent space, capturing both structural information and uncertainty around the trajectories. We evaluate TGNE's effectiveness in reconstructing the original graph and modelling uncertainty. The results demonstrate that TGNE generates competitive time-varying embedding locations compared to common baselines for reconstructing unobserved edge interactions based on observed edges. Furthermore, the uncertainty estimates align with the time-varying degree distribution in the network, providing valuable insights into the temporal dynamics of the graph. To facilitate reproducibility, we provide an open-source implementation of TGNE at \url{https://github.com/aida-ugent/tgne}.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpikeReveal: Unlocking Temporal Sequences from Real Blurry Inputs with Spike Streams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09486v2)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing a sequence of sharp images from the blurry input is crucial for enhancing our insights into the captured scene and poses a significant challenge due to the limited temporal features embedded in the image. Spike cameras, sampling at rates up to 40,000 Hz, have proven effective in capturing motion features and beneficial for solving this ill-posed problem. Nonetheless, existing methods fall into the supervised learning paradigm, which suffers from notable performance degradation when applied to real-world scenarios that diverge from the synthetic training data domain. Moreover, the quality of reconstructed images is capped by the generated images based on motion analysis interpolation, which inherently differs from the actual scene, affecting the generalization ability of these methods in real high-speed scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the first self-supervised framework for the task of spike-guided motion deblurring. Our approach begins with the formulation of a spike-guided deblurring model that explores the theoretical relationships among spike streams, blurry images, and their corresponding sharp sequences. We subsequently develop a self-supervised cascaded framework to alleviate the issues of spike noise and spatial-resolution mismatching encountered in the deblurring model. With knowledge distillation and re-blurring loss, we further design a lightweight deblur network to generate high-quality sequences with brightness and texture consistency with the original input. Quantitative and qualitative experiments conducted on our real-world and synthetic datasets with spikes validate the superior generalization of the proposed framework. Our code, data and trained models will be available at \url{https://github.com/chenkang455/S-SDM}.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[Hidden Markov modelling of spatio-temporal dynamics of measles in 1750-1850 Finland](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16885v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real world spatio-temporal datasets, and phenomena related to them, are often challenging to visualise or gain a general overview of. In order to summarise information encompassed in such data, we combine two well known statistical modelling methods. To account for the spatial dimension, we use the intrinsic modification of the conditional autoregression, and incorporate it with the hidden Markov model, allowing the spatial patterns to vary over time. We apply our method into parish register data considering deaths caused by measles in Finland in 1750-1850, and gain novel insight of previously undiscovered infection dynamics. Five distinctive, reoccurring states describing spatially and temporally differing infection burden and potential routes of spread are identified. We also find that there is a change in the occurrences of the most typical spatial patterns circa 1812, possibly due to changes in communication routes after major administrative transformations in Finland.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Spiking Neural Networks with Synaptic Delay for Graph Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16851v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are investigated as biologically inspired models of neural computation, distinguished by their computational capability and energy efficiency due to precise spiking times and sparse spikes with event-driven computation. A significant question is how SNNs can emulate human-like graph-based reasoning of concepts and relations, especially leveraging the temporal domain optimally. This paper reveals that SNNs, when amalgamated with synaptic delay and temporal coding, are proficient in executing (knowledge) graph reasoning. It is elucidated that spiking time can function as an additional dimension to encode relation properties via a neural-generalized path formulation. Empirical results highlight the efficacy of temporal delay in relation processing and showcase exemplary performance in diverse graph reasoning tasks. The spiking model is theoretically estimated to achieve $20\times$ energy savings compared to non-spiking counterparts, deepening insights into the capabilities and potential of biologically inspired SNNs for efficient reasoning.

In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from the stochastic processes associated with the particle labels. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over the large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the dynamic evolution of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transformers Learn Temporal Difference Methods for In-Context Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13861v2)** | 2024-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning refers to the learning ability of a model during inference time without adapting its parameters. The input (i.e., prompt) to the model (e.g., transformers) consists of both a context (i.e., instance-label pairs) and a query instance. The model is then able to output a label for the query instance according to the context during inference. A possible explanation for in-context learning is that the forward pass of (linear) transformers implements iterations of gradient descent on the instance-label pairs in the context. In this paper, we prove by construction that transformers can also implement temporal difference (TD) learning in the forward pass, a phenomenon we refer to as in-context TD. We demonstrate the emergence of in-context TD after training the transformer with a multi-task TD algorithm, accompanied by theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we prove that transformers are expressive enough to implement many other policy evaluation algorithms in the forward pass, including residual gradient, TD with eligibility trace, and average-reward TD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion4D: Fast Spatial-temporal Consistent 4D Generation via Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16645v1)** | 2024-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The availability of large-scale multimodal datasets and advancements in diffusion models have significantly accelerated progress in 4D content generation. Most prior approaches rely on multiple image or video diffusion models, utilizing score distillation sampling for optimization or generating pseudo novel views for direct supervision. However, these methods are hindered by slow optimization speeds and multi-view inconsistency issues. Spatial and temporal consistency in 4D geometry has been extensively explored respectively in 3D-aware diffusion models and traditional monocular video diffusion models. Building on this foundation, we propose a strategy to migrate the temporal consistency in video diffusion models to the spatial-temporal consistency required for 4D generation. Specifically, we present a novel framework, \textbf{Diffusion4D}, for efficient and scalable 4D content generation. Leveraging a meticulously curated dynamic 3D dataset, we develop a 4D-aware video diffusion model capable of synthesizing orbital views of dynamic 3D assets. To control the dynamic strength of these assets, we introduce a 3D-to-4D motion magnitude metric as guidance. Additionally, we propose a novel motion magnitude reconstruction loss and 3D-aware classifier-free guidance to refine the learning and generation of motion dynamics. After obtaining orbital views of the 4D asset, we perform explicit 4D construction with Gaussian splatting in a coarse-to-fine manner. The synthesized multi-view consistent 4D image set enables us to swiftly generate high-fidelity and diverse 4D assets within just several minutes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art techniques in terms of generation efficiency and 4D geometry consistency across various prompt modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://vita-group.github.io/Diffusion4D</p></details> |

Mobile networks offer a promising alternative using network activity counts, but these lack crucial directionality. Thus, we present the TeltoMob dataset, featuring undirected telecom counts and corresponding directional flows, to predict directional mobility flows on roadways. To address this, we propose a two-stage spatio-temporal graph neural network (STGNN) framework. The first stage uses a pre-trained STGNN to process telecom data, while the second stage integrates directional and geographic insights for accurate prediction. Our experiments demonstrate the framework's compatibility with various STGNN models and confirm its effectiveness. We also show how to incorporate the framework into real-world transportation systems, enhancing sustainable urban mobility.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 Fig...</summary><p>8 Figures, 5 Tables.

| **[RealTCD: Temporal Causal Discovery from Interventional Data with Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14786v2)** | 2024-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of Artificial Intelligence for Information Technology Operations, causal discovery is pivotal for operation and maintenance of graph construction, facilitating downstream industrial tasks such as root cause analysis. Temporal causal discovery, as an emerging method, aims to identify temporal causal relationships between variables directly from observations by utilizing interventional data. However, existing methods mainly focus on synthetic datasets with heavy reliance on intervention targets and ignore the textual information hidden in real-world systems, failing to conduct causal discovery for real industrial scenarios. To tackle this problem, in this paper we propose to investigate temporal causal discovery in industrial scenarios, which faces two critical challenges: 1) how to discover causal relationships without the interventional targets that are costly to obtain in practice, and 2) how to discover causal relations via leveraging the textual information in systems which can be complex yet abundant in industrial contexts. To address these challenges, we propose the RealTCD framework, which is able to leverage domain knowledge to discover temporal causal relationships without interventional targets. Specifically, we first develop a score-based temporal causal discovery method capable of discovering causal relations for root cause analysis without relying on interventional targets through strategic masking and regularization. Furthermore, by employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle texts and integrate domain knowledge, we introduce LLM-guided meta-initialization to extract the meta-knowledge from textual information hidden in systems to boost the quality of discovery. We conduct extensive experiments on simulation and real-world datasets to show the superiority of our proposed RealTCD framework over existing baselines in discovering temporal causal structures.</p></details> |  |

Current training methods cannot simultaneously solve both training and inference dilemmas. This work proposes a novel Temporal Reversible architecture for SNNs (T-RevSNN) to jointly address the training and inference challenges by altering the forward propagation of SNNs. We turn off the temporal dynamics of most spiking neurons and design multi-level temporal reversible interactions at temporal turn-on spiking neurons, resulting in a $O(L)$ training memory. Combined with the temporal reversible nature, we redesign the input encoding and network organization of SNNs to achieve $O(1)$ inference energy cost. Then, we finely adjust the internal units and residual connections of the basic SNN block to ensure the effectiveness of sparse temporal information interaction. T-RevSNN achieves excellent accuracy on ImageNet, while the memory efficiency, training time acceleration, and inference energy efficiency can be significantly improved by $8.6 \times$, $2.0 \times$, and $1.6 \times$, respectively. This work is expected to break the technical bottleneck of significantly increasing memory cost and training time for large-scale SNNs while maintaining high performance and low inference energy cost.

This issue is particularly challenging in spatio-temporal analyses, where it has been less explored so far. To study the effects of air pollution on mortality in Italy, we argue that a model that simultaneously accounts for spatio-temporal confounding and for the non-linear form of the effect of interest is needed. To this end, we propose a Bayesian dynamic generalized linear model, which allows for a non-linear association and for a decomposition of the exposure effect into two components. This decomposition accommodates associations with the outcome at fine and coarse temporal and spatial scales of variation. These features, when combined, allow reducing the spatio-temporal confounding bias and recovering the true shape of the association, as demonstrated through simulation studies. The results from the real-data application indicate that the exposure effect seems to have different magnitudes in different seasons, with peaks in the summer. We hypothesize that this could be due to possible interactions between the exposure variable with air temperature and unmeasured confounders.</p></details> | 40 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Continuous Temporal Domain Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16075v1)** | 2024-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) addresses the challenge of training predictive models under temporally varying data distributions. Traditional TDG approaches typically focus on domain data collected at fixed, discrete time intervals, which limits their capability to capture the inherent dynamics within continuous-evolving and irregularly-observed temporal domains. To overcome this, this work formalizes the concept of Continuous Temporal Domain Generalization (CTDG), where domain data are derived from continuous times and are collected at arbitrary times. CTDG tackles critical challenges including: 1) Characterizing the continuous dynamics of both data and models, 2) Learning complex high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics, and 3) Optimizing and controlling the generalization across continuous temporal domains. To address them, we propose a Koopman operator-driven continuous temporal domain generalization (Koodos) framework. We formulate the problem within a continuous dynamic system and leverage the Koopman theory to learn the underlying dynamics; the framework is further enhanced with a comprehensive optimization strategy equipped with analysis and control driven by prior knowledge of the dynamics patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.</p></details> |  |

To improve the efficiency while keeping the performance, we present a novel perspective centered on per-segment classification. By harnessing the capabilities of Transformers, we tokenize each video segment as an instance token, endowed with intrinsic instance segmentation. To realize efficient action segmentation, we introduce BaFormer, a boundary-aware Transformer network. It employs instance queries for instance segmentation and a global query for class-agnostic boundary prediction, yielding continuous segment proposals. During inference, BaFormer employs a simple yet effective voting strategy to classify boundary-wise segments based on instance segmentation. Remarkably, as a single-stage approach, BaFormer significantly reduces the computational costs, utilizing only 6% of the running time compared to state-of-the-art method DiffAct, while producing better or comparable accuracy over several popular benchmarks.

However, most data-driven weather forecasting models are black-box systems that focus on learning data mapping rather than fine-grained physical evolution in the time dimension. Consequently, the limitations in the temporal scale of datasets prevent these models from forecasting at finer time scales. This paper proposes a physics-AI hybrid model (i.e., WeatherGFT) which Generalizes weather forecasts to Finer-grained Temporal scales beyond training dataset. Specifically, we employ a carefully designed PDE kernel to simulate physical evolution on a small time scale (e.g., 300 seconds) and use a parallel neural networks with a learnable router for bias correction. Furthermore, we introduce a lead time-aware training framework to promote the generalization of the model at different lead times. The weight analysis of physics-AI modules indicates that physics conducts major evolution while AI performs corrections adaptively. Extensive experiments show that WeatherGFT trained on an hourly dataset, achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple lead times and exhibits the capability to generalize 30-minute forecasts.</p></details> |  |

However, many methods that rely on filtering-based algorithms, such as the Kalman Filter, often work well in linear motion scenarios but struggle to accurately predict the locations of objects undergoing complex and non-linear movements. To tackle these scenarios, we propose a motion-based MOT approach with an enhanced temporal motion predictor, ETTrack. Specifically, the motion predictor integrates a transformer model and a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) to capture short-term and long-term motion patterns, and it predicts the future motion of individual objects based on the historical motion information. Additionally, we propose a novel Momentum Correction Loss function that provides additional information regarding the motion direction of objects during training. This allows the motion predictor rapidly adapt to motion variations and more accurately predict future motion. Our experimental results demonstrate that ETTrack achieves a competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art trackers on DanceTrack and SportsMOT, scoring 56.4% and 74.4% in HOTA metrics, respectively.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |

One critical aspect is formulating a consistency constraint specifically for temporal-spatial illumination and appearance enhanced versions, a dimension overlooked in existing methods. In this paper, we present an innovative video Retinex-based decomposition strategy that operates without the need for explicit supervision to delineate illumination and reflectance components. We leverage dynamic cross-frame correspondences for intrinsic appearance and enforce a scene-level continuity constraint on the illumination field to yield satisfactory consistent decomposition results. To further ensure consistent decomposition, we introduce a dual-structure enhancement network featuring a novel cross-frame interaction mechanism. This mechanism can seamlessly integrate with encoder-decoder single-frame networks, incurring minimal additional parameter costs. By supervising different frames simultaneously, this network encourages them to exhibit matching decomposition features, thus achieving the desired temporal propagation.

Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a crucial soil attribute providing valuable insights into soil health, nutrient cycling, greenhouse gas emissions, and overall ecosystem productivity. This study highlights the significance of spatial-temporal deep learning (DL) techniques within the DSM framework. A novel architecture is proposed, incorporating spatial information using a base convolutional neural network (CNN) model and spatial attention mechanism, along with climate temporal information using a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, for SOC prediction across Europe. The model utilizes a comprehensive set of environmental features, including Landsat-8 images, topography, remote sensing indices, and climate time series, as input features. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms conventional ML approaches like random forest commonly used in DSM, yielding lower root mean square error (RMSE). This model is a robust tool for predicting SOC and could be applied to other soil properties, thereby contributing to the advancement of DSM techniques and facilitating land management and decision-making processes based on accurate information.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

However, inherent physical and technical constraints of imaging hardware often necessitate a compromise between temporal resolution and image quality. Frame interpolation emerges as a pivotal solution to this challenge. Previous methods often suffer from discretion when they estimate the intermediate motion and execute the forward warping. In this study, we draw inspiration from fluid mechanics to propose a novel approach for continuously modeling patient anatomic motion using implicit neural representation. It ensures both spatial and temporal continuity, effectively bridging Eulerian and Lagrangian specifications together to naturally facilitate continuous frame interpolation. Our experiments across multiple datasets underscore the method's superior accuracy and speed. Furthermore, as a case-specific optimization (training-free) approach, it circumvents the need for extensive datasets and addresses model generalization issues.</p></details> |  |

This approach proves advantageous in staving off computational challenges that constitute known hindrances to existing nonparametric quantile regression methods when the number of predictors is much larger than the available sample size. We investigate conditions under which estimation is feasible and of good overall quality and obtain sharp approximations that we employ to devising statistical inference methodology. These include simultaneous confidence intervals and tests of hypotheses, whose asymptotics is borne by a non-trivial functional central limit theorem tailored to martingale differences.

| **[On the Identification of Temporally Causal Representation with Instantaneous Dependence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15325v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporally causal representation learning aims to identify the latent causal process from time series observations, but most methods require the assumption that the latent causal processes do not have instantaneous relations. Although some recent methods achieve identifiability in the instantaneous causality case, they require either interventions on the latent variables or grouping of the observations, which are in general difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose an \textbf{ID}entification framework for instantane\textbf{O}us \textbf{L}atent dynamics (\textbf{IDOL}) by imposing a sparse influence constraint that the latent causal processes have sparse time-delayed and instantaneous relations. Specifically, we establish identifiability results of the latent causal process based on sufficient variability and the sparse influence constraint by employing contextual information of time series data. Based on these theories, we incorporate a temporally variational inference architecture to estimate the latent variables and a gradient-based sparsity regularization to identify the latent causal process. Experimental results on simulation datasets illustrate that our method can identify the latent causal process. Furthermore, evaluations on multiple human motion forecasting benchmarks with instantaneous dependencies indicate the effectiveness of our method in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |

Prior works have attempted to address this challenge by creating self-supervised auxiliary tasks, aiming to enrich the agent's learned representations with control-relevant information for future state prediction. However, these objectives are often insufficient to learn representations that can represent the optimal policy or value function, and they often consider tasks with small, abstract discrete action spaces and thus overlook the importance of action representation learning in continuous control. In this paper, we introduce TACO: Temporal Action-driven Contrastive Learning, a simple yet powerful temporal contrastive learning approach that facilitates the concurrent acquisition of latent state and action representations for agents. TACO simultaneously learns a state and an action representation by optimizing the mutual information between representations of current states paired with action sequences and representations of the corresponding future states. Theoretically, TACO can be shown to learn state and action representations that encompass sufficient information for control, thereby improving sample efficiency. For online RL, TACO achieves 40% performance boost after one million environment interaction steps on average across nine challenging visual continuous control tasks from Deepmind Control Suite. In addition, we show that TACO can also serve as a plug-and-play module adding to existing offline visual RL methods to establish the new state-of-the-art performance for offline visual RL across offline datasets with varying quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023)</p></details> |
| **[Facilitating Battery Swapping Services for Freight Trucks with Spatial-Temporal Demand Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04440v2)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electrifying heavy-duty trucks offers a substantial opportunity to curtail carbon emissions, advancing toward a carbon-neutral future. However, the inherent challenges of limited battery energy and the sheer weight of heavy-duty trucks lead to reduced mileage and prolonged charging durations. Consequently, battery-swapping services emerge as an attractive solution for these trucks. This paper employs a two-fold approach to investigate the potential and enhance the efficacy of such services. Firstly, spatial-temporal demand prediction models are adopted to predict the traffic patterns for the upcoming hours. Subsequently, the prediction guides an optimization module for efficient battery allocation and deployment. Analyzing the heavy-duty truck data on a highway network spanning over 2,500 miles, our model and analysis underscore the value of prediction/machine learning in facilitating future decision-makings. In particular, we find that the initial phase of implementing battery-swapping services favors mobile battery-swapping stations, but as the system matures, fixed-location stations are preferred.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

The utilization of DRL for decision-making facilitates dynamic interaction with the environment, generating control actions aimed at maximizing cumulative rewards. Nevertheless, the inherent uncertainty of the operational environment and the intricate nature of ICPS necessitate exploration within complex and dynamic state spaces during the learning phase. DRL confronts challenges in terms of efficiency, generalization capabilities, and data scarcity during decision-making process. In response to these challenges, we propose an innovative abstract modeling approach grounded in spatial-temporal value semantics, capturing the evolution in the distribution of semantic value across time and space. A semantics-based abstraction is introduced to construct an abstract Markov Decision Process (MDP) for the DRL learning process. Furthermore, optimization techniques for abstraction are delineated, aiming to refine the abstract model and mitigate semantic gaps between abstract and concrete states. The efficacy of the abstract modeling is assessed through the evaluation and analysis of the abstract MDP model using PRISM. A series of experiments are conducted, involving diverse scenarios such as lane-keeping, adaptive cruise control, and intersection crossroad assistance, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our abstracting approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 7 figures, conference</p></details> |

Recently, transformer based models have shown remarkable potential in weather forecasting achieving state-of-the-art results. However, transformers are discrete models which limit their ability to learn the continuous spatio-temporal features of the dynamical weather system. We address this issue with STC-ViT, a Spatio-Temporal Continuous Vision Transformer for weather forecasting. STC-ViT incorporates the continuous time Neural ODE layers with multi-head attention mechanism to learn the continuous weather evolution over time. The attention mechanism is encoded as a differentiable function in the transformer architecture to model the complex weather dynamics. We evaluate STC-ViT against a operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model and several deep learning based weather forecasting models. STC-ViT performs competitively with current data-driven methods in global forecasting while only being trained at lower resolution data and with less compute power.</p></details> |  |

The model takes as inputs sequences of stamp images and metadata contained in each alert, as well as features from the All-WISE catalog. The proposed model, called temporal stamp classifier, is able to discriminate between three classes of astronomical objects: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), Super-Novae (SNe) and Variable Stars (VS), with an accuracy of approximately 98% in the test set, when using 2 to 5 detections. The results show that the model performance improves with the addition of more detections. Simple recurrence models obtain competitive results with those of more complex models such as LSTM.We also propose changes to the original stamp classifier model, which only uses the first detection. The performance of the latter model improves with changes in the architecture and the addition of random rotations, achieving a 1.46% increase in test accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in International Joint Conference on Neural Networks 2024</p></details> |

But with increasing task complexity, LTL formulas unavoidably grow lengthy, complicating interpretation and specification generation, and straining the computational capacities of the planners. A recent development has been the hierarchical representation of LTL~\cite{luo2024simultaneous} that contains multiple temporal logic specifications, providing a more interpretable framework. However, the proposed planning algorithm assumes the independence of robots within each specification, limiting their application to multi-robot coordination with complex temporal constraints. In this work, we formulated a decomposition-based hierarchical framework. At the high level, each specification is first decomposed into a set of atomic sub-tasks. We further infer the temporal relations among the sub-tasks of different specifications to construct a task network. Subsequently, a Mixed Integer Linear Program is used to assign sub-tasks to various robots. At the lower level, domain-specific controllers are employed to execute sub-tasks. Our approach was experimentally applied to domains of navigation and manipulation. The simulation demonstrated that our approach can find better solutions using less runtimes.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures.

However, it has two critical issues: high sensitivity to hyperparameters, especially weight decay, and unsatisfactory performance in online and continual learning, where neuroscientists believe that powerful memory functions are necessary, as in brains. In this paper, we propose PhiNet, inspired by a hippocampal model based on the temporal prediction hypothesis. Unlike SimSiam, which aligns two augmented views of the original image, PhiNet integrates an additional predictor block that estimates the original image representation to imitate the CA1 region in the hippocampus. Moreover, we model the neocortex inspired by the Complementary Learning Systems theory with a momentum encoder block as a slow learner, which works as long-term memory. We demonstrate through analysing the learning dynamics that PhiNet benefits from the additional predictor to prevent the complete collapse of learned representations, a notorious challenge in non-contrastive learning. This dynamics analysis may partially corroborate why this hippocampal model is biologically plausible. Experimental results demonstrate that PhiNet is more robust to weight decay and performs better than SimSiam in memory-intensive tasks like online and continual learning.</p></details> |  |

The existing video editing methods usually apply the typical 2D DDIM inversion or naive spatial-temporal DDIM inversion before editing, which leverages time-varying representation for each frame to derive noisy latent. Unlike most existing approaches, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Expectation-Maximization (STEM) inversion, which formulates the dense video feature under an expectation-maximization manner and iteratively estimates a more compact basis set to represent the whole video. Each frame applies the fixed and global representation for inversion, which is more friendly for temporal consistency during reconstruction and editing. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our STEM inversion can achieve consistent improvement on two state-of-the-art video editing methods.

Although pretrained foundation models for natural languages have experienced remarkable breakthroughs, wherein one general-purpose model can tackle multiple tasks across various domains, urban spatio-temporal modeling lags behind. Existing approaches for urban prediction are usually tailored for specific spatio-temporal scenarios, requiring task-specific model designs and extensive in-domain training data. In this work, we propose a universal model, UniST, for urban spatio-temporal prediction. Drawing inspiration from large language models, UniST achieves success through: (i) flexibility towards diverse spatio-temporal data characteristics, (ii) effective generative pre-training with elaborated masking strategies to capture complex spatio-temporal relationships, (iii) spatio-temporal knowledge-guided prompts that align and leverage intrinsic and shared knowledge across scenarios. These designs together unlock the potential of a one-for-all model for spatio-temporal prediction with powerful generalization capability. Extensive experiments on 15 cities and 6 domains demonstrate the universality of UniST in advancing state-of-the-art prediction performance, especially in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios. The implementation is available at this repository: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/UniST.</p></details> |  |

This design captures and utilizes temporal dependencies, significantly enhancing the generative capabilities of SNNs. Neuroscientific research has identified hippocampal "time cells" that fire sequentially during temporally structured experiences. Our temporal codebook emulates this behavior by triggering the activation of time cell populations based on similarity measures as input stimuli pass through it. We conducted extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets, including MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR10, CelebA, and downsampled LSUN Bedroom, to validate our model's performance. Furthermore, we evaluated the effectiveness of the temporal codebook on neuromorphic datasets NMNIST and DVS-CIFAR10, and demonstrated the model's capability with high-resolution datasets such as CelebA-HQ, LSUN Bedroom, and LSUN Church. The experimental results indicate that our method consistently outperforms existing SNN-based generative models across multiple datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our approach excels in generating high-resolution and temporally consistent data, underscoring the crucial role of temporal information in SNN-based generative modeling.</p></details> |  |

Despite significant advancements, existing methods face challenges in managing confidence bias towards salient objects and capturing long-term dependencies in video sequences. To address these issues, we introduce SpikeMba: a multi-modal spiking saliency mamba for temporal video grounding. Our approach integrates Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with state space models (SSMs) to leverage their unique advantages in handling different aspects of the task. Specifically, we use SNNs to develop a spiking saliency detector that generates the proposal set. The detector emits spike signals when the input signal exceeds a predefined threshold, resulting in a dynamic and binary saliency proposal set. To enhance the model's capability to retain and infer contextual information, we introduce relevant slots which learnable tensors that encode prior knowledge. These slots work with the contextual moment reasoner to maintain a balance between preserving contextual information and exploring semantic relevance dynamically. The SSMs facilitate selective information propagation, addressing the challenge of long-term dependency in video content. By combining SNNs for proposal generation and SSMs for effective contextual reasoning, SpikeMba addresses confidence bias and long-term dependencies, thereby significantly enhancing fine-grained multimodal relationship capture. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SpikeMba, which consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across mainstream benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Despite the recognized importance of this task, a notable gap exists due to the discreteness of symbolic representations and the continuous nature of machine-learning computations. One of the desired bridges between these two worlds would be to define semantically grounded vector representation (feature embedding) of logic formulae, thus enabling to perform continuous learning and optimization in the semantic space of formulae. We tackle this goal for knowledge expressed in Signal Temporal Logic (STL) and devise a method to compute continuous embeddings of formulae with several desirable properties: the embedding (i) is finite-dimensional, (ii) faithfully reflects the semantics of the formulae, (iii) does not require any learning but instead is defined from basic principles, (iv) is interpretable. Another significant contribution lies in demonstrating the efficacy of the approach in two tasks: learning model checking, where we predict the probability of requirements being satisfied in stochastic processes; and integrating the embeddings into a neuro-symbolic framework, to constrain the output of a deep-learning generative model to comply to a given logical specification.</p></details> |  |

Existing TAS methods are constrained to offline scenarios due to their heavy reliance on multimodal features and complete contextual information. The STAS task requires the model to classify each frame of the entire untrimmed video sequence clip by clip in time, thereby extending the applicability of TAS methods to online scenarios. However, directly applying existing TAS methods to SATS tasks results in significantly poor segmentation outcomes. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze the fundamental differences between STAS tasks and TAS tasks, attributing the severe performance degradation when transferring models to model bias and optimization dilemmas. We introduce an end-to-end streaming video temporal action segmentation model with reinforcement learning (SVTAS-RL). The end-to-end modeling method mitigates the modeling bias introduced by the change in task nature and enhances the feasibility of online solutions. Reinforcement learning is utilized to alleviate the optimization dilemma. Through extensive experiments, the SVTAS-RL model significantly outperforms existing STAS models and achieves competitive performance to the state-of-the-art TAS model on multiple datasets under the same evaluation criteria, demonstrating notable advantages on the ultra-long video dataset EGTEA.

An important step in this direction is requirement mining, i.e. inferring formally specified system properties from observed behaviors, in order to discover knowledge about the system. Signal Temporal Logic (STL) offers a concise yet expressive language for specifying requirements, particularly suited for CPS, where behaviors are typically represented as time series data. This work addresses the task of learning STL requirements from observed behaviors in a data-driven manner, focusing on binary classification, i.e. on inferring properties of the system which are able to discriminate between regular and anomalous behaviour, and that can be used both as classifiers and as monitors of the compliance of the CPS to desirable specifications. We present a novel framework that combines Bayesian Optimization (BO) and Information Retrieval (IR) techniques to simultaneously learn both the structure and the parameters of STL formulae, without restrictions on the STL grammar. Specifically, we propose a framework that leverages a dense vector database containing semantic-preserving continuous representations of millions of formulae, queried for facilitating the mining of requirements inside a BO loop. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in several signal classification applications, showing its ability to extract interpretable insights from system executions and advance the state-of-the-art in requirement mining for CPS.</p></details> |  |

Although static 3D point cloud processing has witnessed significant advancements, designing an effective 4D point cloud video backbone remains challenging, mainly due to the irregular and unordered distribution of points and temporal inconsistencies across frames. Moreover, recent state-of-the-art 4D backbones predominantly rely on transformer-based architectures, which commonly suffer from large computational costs due to their quadratic complexity, particularly when processing long video sequences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel 4D point cloud video understanding backbone based on the recently advanced State Space Models (SSMs). Specifically, our backbone begins by disentangling space and time in raw 4D sequences, and then establishing spatio-temporal correlations using our newly developed Intra-frame Spatial Mamba and Inter-frame Temporal Mamba blocks. The Intra-frame Spatial Mamba module is designed to encode locally similar or related geometric structures within a certain temporal searching stride, which can effectively capture short-term dynamics. Subsequently, these locally correlated tokens are delivered to the Inter-frame Temporal Mamba module, which globally integrates point features across the entire video with linear complexity, further establishing long-range motion dependencies. Experimental results on human action recognition and 4D semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method. Especially, for long video sequences, our proposed Mamba-based method has an 87.5% GPU memory reduction, 5.36 times speed-up, and much higher accuracy (up to +10.4%) compared with transformer-based counterparts on MSR-Action3D dataset.</p></details> |  |

Existing models often overlook the temporal dimension in their training process, leading to suboptimal performance of those models over time, as they treat training data as a single homogeneous block. To address this, we introduce ChronosLex, an incremental training paradigm that trains models on chronological splits, preserving the temporal order of the data. However, this incremental approach raises concerns about overfitting to recent data, prompting an assessment of mitigation strategies using continual learning and temporal invariant methods. Our experimental results over six legal multi-label text classification datasets reveal that continual learning methods prove effective in preventing overfitting thereby enhancing temporal generalizability, while temporal invariant methods struggle to capture these dynamics of temporal shifts.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL 2024 |

Conventional methods in TKGR typically depend on deep learning algorithms or temporal logical rules. However, deep learning-based TKGRs often lack interpretability, whereas rule-based TKGRs struggle to effectively learn temporal rules that capture temporal patterns. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated extensive knowledge and remarkable proficiency in temporal reasoning. Consequently, the employment of LLMs for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning (TKGR) has sparked increasing interest among researchers. Nonetheless, LLMs are known to function as black boxes, making it challenging to comprehend their reasoning process. Additionally, due to the resource-intensive nature of fine-tuning, promptly updating LLMs to integrate evolving knowledge within TKGs for reasoning is impractical. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Large Language Models-guided Dynamic Adaptation (LLM-DA) method for reasoning on TKGs. Specifically, LLM-DA harnesses the capabilities of LLMs to analyze historical data and extract temporal logical rules. These rules unveil temporal patterns and facilitate interpretable reasoning. To account for the evolving nature of TKGs, a dynamic adaptation strategy is proposed to update the LLM-generated rules with the latest events. This ensures that the extracted rules always incorporate the most recent knowledge and better generalize to the predictions on future events.

The algorithm can be used for both probabilistic and deterministic multi-step forecasting, making it applicable for estimation and generation tasks. Comparative evaluations against various baselines, including temporal graph neural network (TGNN) models and classical Kalman filters, demonstrate that mspace performs at par with the state-of-the-art and even surpasses them on some datasets. Importantly, mspace demonstrates consistent performance across datasets with varying training sizes, a notable advantage over TGNN models that require abundant training samples to effectively learn the spatiotemporal trends in the data. Therefore, employing mspace is advantageous in scenarios where the training sample availability is limited. Additionally, we establish theoretical bounds on multi-step forecasting error of mspace and show that it scales linearly with the number of forecast steps $q$ as $\mathcal{O}(q)$. For an asymptotically large number of nodes $n$, and timesteps $T$, the computational complexity of mspace grows linearly with both $n$, and $T$, i.e., $\mathcal{O}(nT)$, while its space complexity remains constant $\mathcal{O}(1)$. We compare the performance of various mspace variants against ten recent TGNN baselines and two classical baselines, ARIMA and the Kalman filter across ten real-world datasets. Additionally, we propose a technique to generate synthetic datasets to aid in evaluating node feature forecasting methods, with the potential to serve as a benchmark for future research. Lastly, we have investigate the interpretability of different mspace variants by analyzing model parameters alongside dataset characteristics to derive model and data-centric insights.</p></details> | 23 pages |

Literature in the field of behavioural psychology indicates that gait, described as the way a person walks, is an additional indicator of emotions. In this work, we propose a deep framework for emotion recognition through the analysis of gait. More specifically, our model is composed of a sequence of spatial-temporal Graph Convolutional Networks that produce a robust skeleton-based representation for the task of emotion classification. We evaluate our proposed framework on the E-Gait dataset, composed of a total of 2177 samples. The results obtained represent an improvement of approximately 5% in accuracy compared to the state of the art. In addition, during training we observed a faster convergence of our model compared to the state-of-the-art methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the LXCV Workshop @ CVPR 2024</p></details> |

We focus on interfacing these networks with event-based data to perform online spatiotemporal classification and detection with low latency. By virtue of using structured temporal kernels and event-based data, we have the freedom to vary the sample rate of the data along with the discretization step-size of the network without additional finetuning. We experimented with three event-based benchmarks and obtained state-of-the-art results on all three by large margins with significantly smaller memory and compute costs. We achieved: 1) 99.59% accuracy with 192K parameters on the DVS128 hand gesture recognition dataset and 100% with a small additional output filter; 2) 99.58% test accuracy with 277K parameters on the AIS 2024 eye tracking challenge; and 3) 0.556 mAP with 576k parameters on the PROPHESEE 1 Megapixel Automotive Detection Dataset.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |

However, most existing methods are limited in highway or highly simplified intersection scenarios due to the intricacy and diversity of traffic scenarios. In response, we propose Traffic Scenario Logic (TSL), which is a spatial-temporal logic designed for modeling and reasoning of urban pedestrian-free traffic scenarios. TSL provides a formal representation of the urban road network that can be derived from OpenDRIVE, i.e., the de facto industry standard of high-definition maps for autonomous driving, enabling the representation of a broad range of traffic scenarios. We implemented the reasoning of TSL using Telingo, i.e., a solver for temporal programs based on the Answer Set Programming, and tested it on different urban road layouts. Demonstrations show the effectiveness of TSL in test scenario generation and its potential value in areas like decision-making and control verification of autonomous driving.</p></details> | Submitted to KR 2024 |
| **[VTG-LLM: Integrating Timestamp Knowledge into Video LLMs for Enhanced Video Temporal Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13382v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) focuses on accurately identifying event timestamps within a particular video based on a linguistic query, playing a vital role in downstream tasks such as video browsing and editing. While Video Large Language Models (video LLMs) have made significant progress in understanding video content, they often face challenges in accurately pinpointing timestamps within videos, which limits their performance on VTG tasks. Therefore, to improve video LLMs' ability to effectively locate timestamps, we argue that two critical aspects need to be enhanced. First, it is essential to have high-quality instructional tuning datasets that encompass mainstream VTG tasks. Second, directly incorporating timestamp knowledge into video LLMs is crucial, as it enables models to efficiently comprehend timestamp information. To address these needs, we first introduce VTG-IT-120K, a high-quality and comprehensive instruction tuning dataset that covers VTG tasks such as moment retrieval, dense video captioning, video summarization, and video highlight detection. Furthermore, we propose a specially designed video LLM model for VTG tasks, VTG-LLM, which (1) effectively integrates timestamp knowledge into visual tokens; (2) incorporates absolute-time tokens that specifically handle timestamp knowledge, thereby avoiding concept shifts; and (3) introduces a lightweight, high-performance slot-based token compression method to facilitate the sampling of more video frames. Comprehensive experiments showcase the superior performance of VTG-LLM in comparison to other video LLM methods across various VTG tasks.

| **[System Safety Monitoring of Learned Components Using Temporal Metric Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13254v1)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In learning-enabled autonomous systems, safety monitoring of learned components is crucial to ensure their outputs do not lead to system safety violations, given the operational context of the system. However, developing a safety monitor for practical deployment in real-world applications is challenging. This is due to limited access to internal workings and training data of the learned component. Furthermore, safety monitors should predict safety violations with low latency, while consuming a reasonable amount of computation. To address the challenges, we propose a safety monitoring method based on probabilistic time series forecasting. Given the learned component outputs and an operational context, we empirically investigate different Deep Learning (DL)-based probabilistic forecasting to predict the objective measure capturing the satisfaction or violation of a safety requirement (safety metric). We empirically evaluate safety metric and violation prediction accuracy, and inference latency and resource usage of four state-of-the-art models, with varying horizons, using an autonomous aviation case study. Our results suggest that probabilistic forecasting of safety metrics, given learned component outputs and scenarios, is effective for safety monitoring. Furthermore, for the autonomous aviation case study, Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) was the most accurate model for predicting imminent safety violations, with acceptable latency and resource consumption.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretable Spatio-Temporal Embedding for Brain Structural-Effective Network with Ordinary Differential Equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13190v1)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The MRI-derived brain network serves as a pivotal instrument in elucidating both the structural and functional aspects of the brain, encompassing the ramifications of diseases and developmental processes. However, prevailing methodologies, often focusing on synchronous BOLD signals from functional MRI (fMRI), may not capture directional influences among brain regions and rarely tackle temporal functional dynamics. In this study, we first construct the brain-effective network via the dynamic causal model. Subsequently, we introduce an interpretable graph learning framework termed Spatio-Temporal Embedding ODE (STE-ODE). This framework incorporates specifically designed directed node embedding layers, aiming at capturing the dynamic interplay between structural and effective networks via an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model, which characterizes spatial-temporal brain dynamics. Our framework is validated on several clinical phenotype prediction tasks using two independent publicly available datasets (HCP and OASIS). The experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantages of our model compared to several state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing equivariant Graph Neural Network (GNN) based methods have encapsulated the symmetry of physics, \emph{e.g.}, translations, rotations, etc, leading to better generalization ability. Nevertheless, their frame-to-frame formulation of the task overlooks the non-Markov property mainly incurred by unobserved dynamics in the environment. In this paper, we reformulate dynamics simulation as a spatio-temporal prediction task, by employing the trajectory in the past period to recover the Non-Markovian interactions. We propose Equivariant Spatio-Temporal Attentive Graph Networks (ESTAG), an equivariant version of spatio-temporal GNNs, to fulfill our purpose. At its core, we design a novel Equivariant Discrete Fourier Transform (EDFT) to extract periodic patterns from the history frames, and then construct an Equivariant Spatial Module (ESM) to accomplish spatial message passing, and an Equivariant Temporal Module (ETM) with the forward attention and equivariant pooling mechanisms to aggregate temporal message. We evaluate our model on three real datasets corresponding to the molecular-, protein- and macro-level. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of ESTAG compared to typical spatio-temporal GNNs and equivariant GNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been published to the conference of NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |

Classical control theoretical tools addressing STL constraints either adopt a limited fragment of the STL formula or require approximations of min/max operators, whereas works maximising robustness through optimisation-based methods often suffer from local minima, relaxing any completeness arguments due to the NP-hard nature of the problem. Endowed with probabilistic guarantees, MAPS$^2$ provides an anytime algorithm that iteratively improves the robots' trajectories. The algorithm selectively imposes spatial constraints by taking advantage of the temporal properties of the STL. The algorithm is distributed, in the sense that each robot calculates its trajectory by communicating only with its immediate neighbours as defined via a communication graph. We illustrate the efficiency of MAPS$^2$ by conducting extensive simulation and experimental studies, verifying the generation of STL satisfying trajectories.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedASTA: Federated adaptive spatial-temporal attention for traffic flow prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13090v1)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile devices and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices nowadays generate a large amount of heterogeneous spatial-temporal data. It remains a challenging problem to model the spatial-temporal dynamics under privacy concern. Federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a framework to enable model training across distributed devices without sharing original data which reduce privacy concern. Personalized federated learning (PFL) methods further address data heterogenous problem. However, these methods don't consider natural spatial relations among nodes. For the sake of modeling spatial relations, Graph Neural Netowork (GNN) based FL approach have been proposed. But dynamic spatial-temporal relations among edge nodes are not taken into account. Several approaches model spatial-temporal dynamics in a centralized environment, while less effort has been made under federated setting. To overcome these challeges, we propose a novel Federated Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Attention (FedASTA) framework to model the dynamic spatial-temporal relations. On the client node, FedASTA extracts temporal relations and trend patterns from the decomposed terms of original time series. Then, on the server node, FedASTA utilize trend patterns from clients to construct adaptive temporal-spatial aware graph which captures dynamic correlation between clients. Besides, we design a masked spatial attention module with both static graph and constructed adaptive graph to model spatial dependencies among clients. Extensive experiments on five real-world public traffic flow datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-art performance in federated scenario. In addition, the experiments made in centralized setting show the effectiveness of our novel adaptive graph construction approach compared with other popular dynamic spatial-temporal aware methods.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a temporal logic based approach that allows robots' behaviors and goals to adapt to the semantics of the environment. In particular, we present a hierarchical representation of soccer in which the robot selects the level of operation based on the perceived semantic characteristics of the environment, thus modifying dynamically the set of rules and goals to apply. The proposed approach enables the robot to operate in unstructured environments, just as it happens when humans go from soccer played on an official field to soccer played on a street. Three different use cases set in different scenarios are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>RoboC...</summary><p>RoboCup 2023: Robot World Cup XXVI Best Paper</p></details> |

However, their performance is constrained by the reliance on extensive data for training on specific tasks, which limits their adaptability to new urban domains with varied demands. Although transfer learning has been proposed to address this problem by leveraging knowledge across domains, cross-task generalization remains underexplored in spatio-temporal graph transfer learning methods due to the absence of a unified framework. To bridge this gap, we propose Spatio-Temporal Graph Prompting (STGP), a prompt-enhanced transfer learning framework capable of adapting to diverse tasks in data-scarce domains. Specifically, we first unify different tasks into a single template and introduce a task-agnostic network architecture that aligns with this template. This approach enables the capture of spatio-temporal dependencies shared across tasks. Furthermore, we employ learnable prompts to achieve domain and task transfer in a two-stage prompting pipeline, enabling the prompts to effectively capture domain knowledge and task-specific properties at each stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STGP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in three downstream tasks forecasting, kriging, and extrapolation by a notable margin.</p></details> |  |

Although deep learning approaches have achieved considerable success in predicting RUL, challenges such as low prediction accuracy and interpretability pose significant challenges, hindering their practical implementation. In this work, we introduce a Spatio-temporal Attention-based Hidden Physics-informed Neural Network (STA-HPINN) for RUL prediction, which can utilize the associated physics of the system degradation. The spatio-temporal attention mechanism can extract important features from the input data. With the self-attention mechanism on both the sensor dimension and time step dimension, the proposed model can effectively extract degradation information. The hidden physics-informed neural network is utilized to capture the physics mechanisms that govern the evolution of RUL. With the constraint of physics, the model can achieve higher accuracy and reasonable predictions. The approach is validated on a benchmark dataset, demonstrating exceptional performance when compared to cutting-edge methods, especially in the case of complex conditions.</p></details> |  |

The co-dynamics can be mediated by immunosuppression or -modulation, shared environmental or climatic drivers, or competition for susceptible hosts. Research and statistical methods in epidemiology often concentrate on large pooled datasets, or high quality data from cities, leaving rural areas underrepresented in literature. Data considering rural populations are typically sparse and scarce, especially in the case of historical data sources, which may introduce considerable methodological challenges. In order to overcome many obstacles due to such data, we present a general Bayesian spatio-temporal model for disease co-dynamics. Applying the proposed model on historical (1820-1850) Finnish parish register data, we study the spread of infectious diseases in pre-healthcare Finland. We observe that measles, pertussis, and smallpox exhibit positively correlated dynamics, which could be attributed to immunosuppressive effects or, for example, the general weakening of the population due to recurring infections or poor nutritional conditions.</p></details> |  |

However, leveraging such pretrained models for video editing is considered a major challenge. Many existing works attempt to enforce temporal consistency in the edited video through explicit correspondence mechanisms, either in pixel space or between deep features. These methods, however, struggle with strong nonrigid motion. In this paper, we introduce a fundamentally different approach, which is based on the observation that spatiotemporal slices of natural videos exhibit similar characteristics to natural images. Thus, the same T2I diffusion model that is normally used only as a prior on video frames, can also serve as a strong prior for enhancing temporal consistency by applying it on spatiotemporal slices. Based on this observation, we present Slicedit, a method for text-based video editing that utilizes a pretrained T2I diffusion model to process both spatial and spatiotemporal slices. Our method generates videos that retain the structure and motion of the original video while adhering to the target text. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate Slicedit's ability to edit a wide range of real-world videos, confirming its clear advantages compared to existing competing methods.

While large strides have been made towards developing dynamic SLAM approaches that estimate the robot pose accurately, a lesser emphasis has been put on the construction of dense spatio-temporal representations of the robot environment. A detailed understanding of the scene and its evolution through time is crucial for long-term robot autonomy and essential to tasks that require long-term reasoning, such as operating effectively in environments shared with humans and other agents and thus are subject to short and long-term dynamics. To address this challenge, this work defines the Spatio-temporal Metric-semantic SLAM (SMS) problem, and presents a framework to factorize and solve it efficiently. We show that the proposed factorization suggests a natural organization of a spatio-temporal perception system, where a fast process tracks short-term dynamics in an active temporal window, while a slower process reasons over long-term changes in the environment using a factor graph formulation. We provide an efficient implementation of the proposed spatio-temporal perception approach, that we call Khronos, and show that it unifies exiting interpretations of short-term and long-term dynamics and is able to construct a dense spatio-temporal map in real-time. We provide simulated and real results, showing that the spatio-temporal maps built by Khronos are an accurate reflection of a 3D scene over time and that Khronos outperforms baselines across multiple metrics. We further validate our approach on two heterogeneous robots in challenging, large-scale real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics: Science and Systems, 2024.

They usually need to be adjusted before being used in impact studies. The suite of statistical methods that enable such adjustments is called bias correction (BC). However, BC methods currently struggle to adjust temporal biases. Because they mostly disregard the dependence between consecutive time points. As a result, climate statistics with long-range temporal properties, such as heatwave duration and frequency, cannot be corrected accurately. This makes it more difficult to produce reliable impact studies on such climate statistics. This paper offers a novel BC methodology to correct temporal biases. This is made possible by rethinking the philosophy behind BC. We will introduce BC as a time-indexed regression task with stochastic outputs. Rethinking BC enables us to adapt state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) attention models and thereby learn different types of biases, including temporal asynchronicities. With a case study of heatwave duration statistics in Abuja, Nigeria, and Tokyo, Japan, we show more accurate results than current climate model outputs and alternative BC methods.</p></details> | 38 pages, 31 figures |

Despite these empirical successes, a theoretical understanding of QTD has proven elusive until now. Unlike classical TD learning, which can be analysed with standard stochastic approximation tools, QTD updates do not approximate contraction mappings, are highly non-linear, and may have multiple fixed points. The core result of this paper is a proof of convergence to the fixed points of a related family of dynamic programming procedures with probability 1, putting QTD on firm theoretical footing. The proof establishes connections between QTD and non-linear differential inclusions through stochastic approximation theory and non-smooth analysis.</p></details> | Accepted to JMLR |

However, susceptibility to various physiological and environmental artifacts introduces noise in recorded EEG data, impeding accurate analysis of underlying brain activity. Denoising techniques are crucial to mitigate this challenge. Recent advancements in deep learningbased approaches exhibit substantial potential for enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of EEG data compared to traditional methods. In the realm of large-scale language models (LLMs), the Retentive Network (Retnet) infrastructure, prevalent for some models, demonstrates robust feature extraction and global modeling capabilities. Recognizing the temporal similarities between EEG signals and natural language, we introduce the Retnet from natural language processing to EEG denoising. This integration presents a novel approach to EEG denoising, opening avenues for a profound understanding of brain activities and accurate diagnosis of neurological diseases. Nonetheless, direct application of Retnet to EEG denoising is unfeasible due to the one-dimensional nature of EEG signals, while natural language processing deals with two-dimensional data. To facilitate Retnet application to EEG denoising, we propose the signal embedding method, transforming one-dimensional EEG signals into two dimensions for use as network inputs. Experimental results validate the substantial improvement in denoising effectiveness achieved by the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, we develop a method for a low-rigidity robot to autonomously learn visual servoing of its body. We also develop a mechanism that can adaptively change its visual servoing according to temporal body changes.

Most rs-fMRI studies compute a single static functional connectivity matrix across brain regions of interest, or dynamic functional connectivity matrices with a sliding window approach. These approaches are at risk of oversimplifying brain dynamics and lack proper consideration of the goal at hand. While deep learning has gained substantial popularity for modeling complex relational data, its application to uncovering the spatiotemporal dynamics of the brain is still limited. We propose a novel interpretable deep learning framework that learns goal-specific functional connectivity matrix directly from time series and employs a specialized graph neural network for the final classification. Our model, DSAM, leverages temporal causal convolutional networks to capture the temporal dynamics in both low- and high-level feature representations, a temporal attention unit to identify important time points, a self-attention unit to construct the goal-specific connectivity matrix, and a novel variant of graph neural network to capture the spatial dynamics for downstream classification. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments on the Human Connectome Project dataset with 1075 samples to build and interpret the model for the classification of sex group, and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Dataset with 8520 samples for independent testing. Compared our proposed framework with other state-of-art models, results suggested this novel approach goes beyond the assumption of a fixed connectivity matrix and provides evidence of goal-specific brain connectivity patterns, which opens up the potential to gain deeper insights into how the human brain adapts its functional connectivity specific to the task at hand.</p></details> | 18 Pages, 4 figures |

Typical methods use a speaker representation from a pre-trained speaker verification (SV) model or learn speaker representation during VC training to achieve zero-shot VC. However, existing speaker modeling methods overlook the variation of speaker information richness in temporal and frequency channel dimensions of speech. This insufficient speaker modeling hampers the ability of the VC model to accurately represent unseen speakers who are not in the training dataset. In this study, we present a robust zero-shot VC model with multi-level temporal-channel retrieval, referred to as MTCR-VC. Specifically, to flexibly adapt to the dynamic-variant speaker characteristic in the temporal and channel axis of the speech, we propose a novel fine-grained speaker modeling method, called temporal-channel retrieval (TCR), to find out when and where speaker information appears in speech. It retrieves variable-length speaker representation from both temporal and channel dimensions under the guidance of a pre-trained SV model. Besides, inspired by the hierarchical process of human speech production, the MTCR speaker module stacks several TCR blocks to extract speaker representations from multi-granularity levels. Furthermore, to achieve better speech disentanglement and reconstruction, we introduce a cycle-based training strategy to simulate zero-shot inference recurrently. We adopt perpetual constraints on three aspects, including content, style, and speaker, to drive this process. Experiments demonstrate that MTCR-VC is superior to the previous zero-shot VC methods in modeling speaker timbre while maintaining good speech naturalness.</p></details> | Submitted to TASLP |
| **[UrbanGPT: Spatio-Temporal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00813v3)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal prediction aims to forecast and gain insights into the ever-changing dynamics of urban environments across both time and space. Its purpose is to anticipate future patterns, trends, and events in diverse facets of urban life, including transportation, population movement, and crime rates. Although numerous efforts have been dedicated to developing neural network techniques for accurate predictions on spatio-temporal data, it is important to note that many of these methods heavily depend on having sufficient labeled data to generate precise spatio-temporal representations. Unfortunately, the issue of data scarcity is pervasive in practical urban sensing scenarios. Consequently, it becomes necessary to build a spatio-temporal model with strong generalization capabilities across diverse spatio-temporal learning scenarios. Taking inspiration from the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs), our objective is to create a spatio-temporal LLM that can exhibit exceptional generalization capabilities across a wide range of downstream urban tasks. To achieve this objective, we present the UrbanGPT, which seamlessly integrates a spatio-temporal dependency encoder with the instruction-tuning paradigm. This integration enables LLMs to comprehend the complex inter-dependencies across time and space, facilitating more comprehensive and accurate predictions under data scarcity. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on various public datasets, covering different spatio-temporal prediction tasks. The results consistently demonstrate that our UrbanGPT, with its carefully designed architecture, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These findings highlight the potential of building large language models for spatio-temporal learning, particularly in zero-shot scenarios where labeled data is scarce.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD'2024 as Full Paper</p></details> |

There are many proposals for the design of intelligent intersections that introduce central decision-makers to intersections for enhancing the efficiency and safety of the vehicles. To guarantee the safety of such designs, we develop a safety framework for intersections based on temporal logic and reachability analysis. We start by specifying the required behavior for all the vehicles that need to pass through the intersection as linear temporal logic formula. Then, using temporal logic trees, we break down the linear temporal logic specification into a series of Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analyses in an automated fashion. By successfully constructing the temporal logic tree through reachability analysis, we verify the feasibility of the intersection specification. By taking this approach, we enable a safety framework that is able to automatically provide safety guarantees on new intersection behavior specifications. To evaluate our approach, we implement the framework on a simulated T-intersection, where we show that we can check and guarantee the safety of vehicles with potentially conflicting paths.</p></details> |  |

In the past few years, various GNN-based methods have been proposed to solely focus on mimicking the relationships among node individuals of the STG network, ignoring the significance of modeling the intrinsic features that exist in STG system over time. In contrast, modern Selective State Space Models (SSSMs) present a new approach which treat STG Network as a system, and meticulously explore the STG system's dynamic state evolution across temporal dimension. In this work, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Graph Mamba (STG-Mamba) as the first exploration of leveraging the powerful selective state space models for STG learning by treating STG Network as a system, and employing the Spatial-Temporal Selective State Space Module (ST-S3M) to precisely focus on the selected STG latent features. Furthermore, to strengthen GNN's ability of modeling STG data under the setting of selective state space models, we propose Kalman Filtering Graph Neural Networks (KFGN) for dynamically integrate and upgrade the STG embeddings from different temporal granularities through a learnable Kalman Filtering statistical theory-based approach. Extensive empirical studies are conducted on three benchmark STG forecasting datasets, demonstrating the performance superiority and computational efficiency of STG-Mamba. It not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of STG forecasting performance, but also effectively alleviate the computational bottleneck of large-scale graph networks in reducing the computational cost of FLOPs and test inference time. The implementation code is available at: \url{https://github.com/LincanLi98/STG-Mamba}.</p></details> |  |
| **[ST-Mamba: Spatial-Temporal Selective State Space Model for Traffic Flow Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13257v2)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic flow prediction, a critical aspect of intelligent transportation systems, has been increasingly popular in the field of artificial intelligence, driven by the availability of extensive traffic data. The current challenges of traffic flow prediction lie in integrating diverse factors while balancing the trade-off between computational complexity and the precision necessary for effective long-range and large-scale predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce a Spatial-Temporal Selective State Space (ST-Mamba) model, which is the first to leverage the power of spatial-temporal learning in traffic flow prediction without using graph modeling. The ST-Mamba model can effectively capture the long-range dependency for traffic flow data, thereby avoiding the issue of over-smoothing. The proposed ST-Mamba model incorporates an effective Spatial-Temporal Mixer (ST-Mixer) to seamlessly integrate spatial and temporal data processing into a unified framework and employs a Spatial-Temporal Selective State Space (ST-SSM) block to improve computational efficiency. The proposed ST-Mamba model, specifically designed for spatial-temporal data, simplifies processing procedure and enhances generalization capabilities, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of long-range traffic flow prediction. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) model, the proposed ST-Mamba model achieves a 61.11\% improvement in computational speed and increases prediction accuracy by 0.67\%. Extensive experiments with real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the \textsf{ST-Mamba} model sets a new benchmark in traffic flow prediction, achieving SOTA performance in computational efficiency for both long- and short-range predictions and significantly improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness of traffic management.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Temporal and spatial downscaling for solar radiation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11046v1)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global and regional climate model projections are useful for gauging future patterns of climate variables, including solar radiation, but data from these models is often too coarse to assess local impacts. Within the context of solar radiation, the changing climate may have an effect on photovoltaic (PV) production, especially as the PV industry moves to extend plant lifetimes to 50 years. Predicting PV production while taking into account a changing climate requires data at a resolution that is useful for building PV plants. Although temporal and spatial downscaling of solar radiation data is widely studied, we present a novel method to downscale solar radiation data from daily averages to hourly profiles, while maintaining spatial correlation of parameters characterizing the diurnal profile of solar radiation. The method focuses on the use of a diurnal template which can be shifted and scaled according to the time or year and location and the use of thin plate splines for spatial downscaling. This analysis is applied to data from the National Solar Radiation Database housed at the National Renewable Energy Lab and a case study of the mentioned methods over several sub-regions of continental United States is presented.</p></details> | 35 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Synthesis of Temporal Causality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10912v1)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an automata-based algorithm to synthesize omega-regular causes for omega-regular effects on executions of a reactive system, such as counterexamples uncovered by a model checker. Our theory is a generalization of temporal causality, which has recently been proposed as a framework for drawing causal relationships between trace properties on a given trace. So far, algorithms exist only for verifying a single causal relationship and, as an extension, cause synthesis through enumeration, which is complete only for a small fragment of effect properties. This work presents the first complete cause-synthesis algorithm for the class of omega-regular effects. We show that in this case, causes are guaranteed to be omega-regular themselves and can be computed as, e.g., nondeterministic B\"uchi automata. We demonstrate the practical feasibility of this algorithm with a prototype tool and evaluate its performance for cause synthesis and cause checking.</p></details> | <details><summary>36th ...</summary><p>36th International Conference on Computer Aided Verification (CAV 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Open-Vocabulary Spatio-Temporal Action Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10832v1)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal action detection (STAD) is an important fine-grained video understanding task. Current methods require box and label supervision for all action classes in advance. However, in real-world applications, it is very likely to come across new action classes not seen in training because the action category space is large and hard to enumerate. Also, the cost of data annotation and model training for new classes is extremely high for traditional methods, as we need to perform detailed box annotations and re-train the whole network from scratch. In this paper, we propose a new challenging setting by performing open-vocabulary STAD to better mimic the situation of action detection in an open world. Open-vocabulary spatio-temporal action detection (OV-STAD) requires training a model on a limited set of base classes with box and label supervision, which is expected to yield good generalization performance on novel action classes. For OV-STAD, we build two benchmarks based on the existing STAD datasets and propose a simple but effective method based on pretrained video-language models (VLM). To better adapt the holistic VLM for the fine-grained action detection task, we carefully fine-tune it on the localized video region-text pairs. This customized fine-tuning endows the VLM with better motion understanding, thus contributing to a more accurate alignment between video regions and texts. Local region feature and global video feature fusion before alignment is adopted to further improve the action detection performance by providing global context. Our method achieves a promising performance on novel classes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-World Graph Analysis: Techniques for Static, Dynamic, and Temporal Communities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10824v1)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are widely used in various fields of computer science. They have also found application in unrelated areas, leading to a diverse range of problems. These problems can be modeled as relationships between entities in various contexts, such as social networks, protein interactions in cells, and route maps. Therefore it is logical to analyze these data structures with diverse approaches, whether they are numerical or structural, global or local, approximate or exact. In particular, the concept of community plays an important role in local structural analysis, as it is able to highlight the composition of the underlying graph while providing insights into what the organization and importance of the nodes in a network look like. This thesis pursues the goal of extracting knowledge from different kinds of graphs, including static, dynamic, and temporal graphs, with a particular focus on their community substructures. To tackle this task we use combinatorial algorithms that can list all the communities in a graph according to different formalizations, such as cliques, $k$-graphlets, and $k$-cores. We first develop new algorithms to enumerate subgraphs, using traditional and novel techniques such as push-out amortization, and CPU cache analysis to boost their efficiency. We then extend these concepts to the analysis of real-world graphs across diverse domains, ranging from social networks to autonomous systems modeled as temporal graphs. In this field, there is currently no widely accepted adaptation, even for straightforward subgraphs like $k$-cores, and the available data is expanding both in terms of quantity and scale. As a result, our findings advance the state of the art both from a theoretical and a practical perspective and can be used in a static or dynamic setting to further speed up and refine graph analysis techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[STLCCP: An Efficient Convex Optimization-based Framework for Signal Temporal Logic Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09441v2)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is capable of expressing a broad range of temporal properties that controlled dynamical systems must satisfy. In the literature, both mixed-integer programming (MIP) and nonlinear programming (NLP) methods have been applied to solve optimal control problems with STL specifications. However, neither approach has succeeded in solving problems with complex long-horizon STL specifications within a realistic timeframe. This study proposes a new optimization framework, called \textit{STLCCP}, which explicitly incorporates several structures of STL to mitigate this issue. The core of our framework is a structure-aware decomposition of STL formulas, which converts the original program into a difference of convex (DC) programs. This program is then solved as a convex quadratic program sequentially, based on the convex-concave procedure (CCP). Our numerical experiments on several commonly used benchmarks demonstrate that this framework can effectively handle complex scenarios over long horizons, which have been challenging to address even using state-of-the-art optimization methods.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[Historically Relevant Event Structuring for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10621v1)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) reasoning focuses on predicting events through historical information within snapshots distributed on a timeline. Existing studies mainly concentrate on two perspectives of leveraging the history of TKGs, including capturing evolution of each recent snapshot or correlations among global historical facts. Despite the achieved significant accomplishments, these models still fall short of (1) investigating the influences of multi-granularity interactions across recent snapshots and (2) harnessing the expressive semantics of significant links accorded with queries throughout the entire history, especially events exerting a profound impact on the future. These inadequacies restrict representation ability to reflect historical dependencies and future trends thoroughly. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose an innovative TKG reasoning approach towards \textbf{His}torically \textbf{R}elevant \textbf{E}vents \textbf{S}tructuring ($\mathsf{HisRES}$). Concretely, $\mathsf{HisRES}$ comprises two distinctive modules excelling in structuring historically relevant events within TKGs, including a multi-granularity evolutionary encoder that captures structural and temporal dependencies of the most recent snapshots, and a global relevance encoder that concentrates on crucial correlations among events relevant to queries from the entire history. Furthermore, $\mathsf{HisRES}$ incorporates a self-gating mechanism for adaptively merging multi-granularity recent and historically relevant structuring representations. Extensive experiments on four event-based benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of $\mathsf{HisRES}$ and indicate the superiority and effectiveness of structuring historical relevance for TKG reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Knowledge Question Answering via Abstract Reasoning Induction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09149v2)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we address the challenge of enhancing temporal knowledge reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs often struggle with this task, leading to the generation of inaccurate or misleading responses. This issue mainly arises from their limited ability to handle evolving factual knowledge and complex temporal logic. To overcome these limitations, we propose Abstract Reasoning Induction (ARI) framework, which divides temporal reasoning into two distinct phases: Knowledge-agnostic and Knowledge-based. This framework offers factual knowledge support to LLMs while minimizing the incorporation of extraneous noisy data. Concurrently, informed by the principles of constructivism, ARI provides LLMs the capability to engage in proactive, self-directed learning from both correct and incorrect historical reasoning samples. By teaching LLMs to actively construct knowledge and methods, it can significantly boosting their temporal reasoning abilities. Our approach achieves remarkable improvements, with relative gains of 29.7% and 9.27% on two temporal QA datasets, underscoring its efficacy in advancing temporal reasoning in LLMs. The code can be found at https://github.com/czy1999/ARI-QA</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2024. 17 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[How Can Large Language Models Understand Spatial-Temporal Data?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14192v2)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) dominate tasks like natural language processing and computer vision, harnessing their power for spatial-temporal forecasting remains challenging. The disparity between sequential text and complex spatial-temporal data hinders this application. To address this issue, this paper introduces STG-LLM, an innovative approach empowering LLMs for spatial-temporal forecasting. We tackle the data mismatch by proposing: 1) STG-Tokenizer: This spatial-temporal graph tokenizer transforms intricate graph data into concise tokens capturing both spatial and temporal relationships; 2) STG-Adapter: This minimalistic adapter, consisting of linear encoding and decoding layers, bridges the gap between tokenized data and LLM comprehension. By fine-tuning only a small set of parameters, it can effectively grasp the semantics of tokens generated by STG-Tokenizer, while preserving the original natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs. Extensive experiments on diverse spatial-temporal benchmark datasets show that STG-LLM successfully unlocks LLM potential for spatial-temporal forecasting. Remarkably, our approach achieves competitive performance on par with dedicated SOTA methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Timeline-based Sentence Decomposition with In-Context Learning for Temporal Fact Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10288v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facts extraction is pivotal for constructing knowledge graphs. Recently, the increasing demand for temporal facts in downstream tasks has led to the emergence of the task of temporal fact extraction. In this paper, we specifically address the extraction of temporal facts from natural language text. Previous studies fail to handle the challenge of establishing time-to-fact correspondences in complex sentences. To overcome this hurdle, we propose a timeline-based sentence decomposition strategy using large language models (LLMs) with in-context learning, ensuring a fine-grained understanding of the timeline associated with various facts. In addition, we evaluate the performance of LLMs for direct temporal fact extraction and get unsatisfactory results. To this end, we introduce TSDRE, a method that incorporates the decomposition capabilities of LLMs into the traditional fine-tuning of smaller pre-trained language models (PLMs). To support the evaluation, we construct ComplexTRED, a complex temporal fact extraction dataset. Our experiments show that TSDRE achieves state-of-the-art results on both HyperRED-Temporal and ComplexTRED datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL2024 main conference</p></details> |
| **[Temporal-Spatial Object Relations Modeling for Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15691v2)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a challenging task where an agent is required to navigate to a natural language described location via vision observations. The navigation abilities of the agent can be enhanced by the relations between objects, which are usually learned using internal objects or external datasets. The relationships between internal objects are modeled employing graph convolutional network (GCN) in traditional studies. However, GCN tends to be shallow, limiting its modeling ability. To address this issue, we utilize a cross attention mechanism to learn the connections between objects over a trajectory, which takes temporal continuity into account, termed as Temporal Object Relations (TOR). The external datasets have a gap with the navigation environment, leading to inaccurate modeling of relations. To avoid this problem, we construct object connections based on observations from all viewpoints in the navigational environment, which ensures complete spatial coverage and eliminates the gap, called Spatial Object Relations (SOR). Additionally, we observe that agents may repeatedly visit the same location during navigation, significantly hindering their performance. For resolving this matter, we introduce the Turning Back Penalty (TBP) loss function, which penalizes the agent's repetitive visiting behavior, substantially reducing the navigational distance. Experimental results on the REVERIE, SOON, and R2R datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

However, reasoning accuracy is adversely impacted due to an imbalance between new and recurring events in the datasets. To achieve more accurate TKG reasoning, we propose an attention masking-based contrastive event network (AMCEN) with local-global temporal patterns for the two-stage prediction of future events. In the network, historical and non-historical attention mask vectors are designed to control the attention bias towards historical and non-historical entities, acting as the key to alleviating the imbalance. A local-global message-passing module is proposed to comprehensively consider and capture multi-hop structural dependencies and local-global temporal evolution for the in-depth exploration of latent impact factors of different event types. A contrastive event classifier is used to classify events more accurately by incorporating local-global temporal patterns into contrastive learning. Therefore, AMCEN refines the prediction scope with the results of the contrastive event classification, followed by utilizing attention masking-based decoders to finalize the specific outcomes. The results of our experiments on four benchmark datasets highlight the superiority of AMCEN. Especially, the considerable improvements in Hits@1 prove that AMCEN can make more precise predictions about future occurrences.</p></details> |  |

With the advancements in RNNs, CNNs, and other non-generative techniques, researchers have explored their application in capturing temporal and spatial dependencies within spatial-temporal data. However, the emergence of generative techniques such as LLMs, SSL, Seq2Seq and diffusion models has opened up new possibilities for enhancing spatial-temporal data mining further. The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of generative technique-based spatial-temporal methods and introduces a standardized framework specifically designed for the spatial-temporal data mining pipeline. By offering a detailed review and a novel taxonomy of spatial-temporal methodology utilizing generative techniques, the paper enables a deeper understanding of the various techniques employed in this field. Furthermore, the paper highlights promising future research directions, urging researchers to delve deeper into spatial-temporal data mining. It emphasizes the need to explore untapped opportunities and push the boundaries of knowledge to unlock new insights and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of spatial-temporal data mining.

The fundamental goal of MLR is to learn the regression models from unlabeled observations. The EM algorithm finds extensive applications in solving the mixture of linear regressions. Recent results have established the super-linear convergence of EM for 2MLR in the noiseless and high SNR settings under some assumptions and its global convergence rate with random initialization has been affirmed. However, the exponent of convergence has not been theoretically estimated and the geometric properties of the trajectory of EM iterations are not well-understood. In this paper, first, using Bessel functions we provide explicit closed-form expressions for the EM updates under all SNR regimes. Then, in the noiseless setting, we completely characterize the behavior of EM iterations by deriving a recurrence relation at the population level and notably show that all the iterations lie on a certain cycloid. Based on this new trajectory-based analysis, we exhibit the theoretical estimate for the exponent of super-linear convergence and further improve the statistical error bound at the finite-sample level. Our analysis provides a new framework for studying the behavior of EM for Mixed Linear Regression.</p></details> |  |

Data augmentation techniques, such as noise injection and data synthesizing, aim to improve Q-function approximation by smoothing the learned state-action region. However, these methods often fall short of directly improving the quality of offline datasets, leading to suboptimal results. In response, we introduce \textbf{GTA}, Generative Trajectory Augmentation, a novel generative data augmentation approach designed to enrich offline data by augmenting trajectories to be both high-rewarding and dynamically plausible. GTA applies a diffusion model within the data augmentation framework. GTA partially noises original trajectories and then denoises them with classifier-free guidance via conditioning on amplified return value. Our results show that GTA, as a general data augmentation strategy, enhances the performance of widely used offline RL algorithms in both dense and sparse reward settings. Furthermore, we conduct a quality analysis of data augmented by GTA and demonstrate that GTA improves the quality of the data.

| **[Resisting Stochastic Risks in Diffusion Planners with the Trajectory Aggregation Tree](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17879v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion planners have shown promise in handling long-horizon and sparse-reward tasks due to the non-autoregressive plan generation. However, their inherent stochastic risk of generating infeasible trajectories presents significant challenges to their reliability and stability. We introduce a novel approach, the Trajectory Aggregation Tree (TAT), to address this issue in diffusion planners. Compared to prior methods that rely solely on raw trajectory predictions, TAT aggregates information from both historical and current trajectories, forming a dynamic tree-like structure. Each trajectory is conceptualized as a branch and individual states as nodes. As the structure evolves with the integration of new trajectories, unreliable states are marginalized, and the most impactful nodes are prioritized for decision-making. TAT can be deployed without modifying the original training and sampling pipelines of diffusion planners, making it a training-free, ready-to-deploy solution. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to support TAT's effectiveness. Our results highlight its remarkable ability to resist the risk from unreliable trajectories, guarantee the performance boosting of diffusion planners in $100\%$ of tasks, and exhibit an appreciable tolerance margin for sample quality, thereby enabling planning with a more than $3\times$ acceleration.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 4...</summary><p>The 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024)</p></details> |

This discards efficacy information carried by partial responses, complete responses, and stable disease that frequently precede progressive disease and death. Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis (CWTA) is a generalization of KM that simultaneously assesses multiple rank-ordered endpoints. We hypothesized that CWTA could use this efficacy information to reduce sample size requirements and expedite efficacy signals in advanced cancer trials. We performed 100-fold and 1000-fold simulations of solid tumour systemic therapy RCTs with health statuses rank ordered from complete response (Stage 0) to death (Stage 4). At increments of sample size and hazard ratio, we compared KM PFS and OS with CWTA for (i) sample size requirements to achieve a power of 0.8 and (ii) time-to-first significant efficacy signal. CWTA consistently demonstrated greater power, and reduced sample size requirements by 18% to 35% compared to KM PFS and 14% to 20% compared to KM OS. CWTA also expedited time-to-efficacy signals 2- to 6-fold. CWTA, by incorporating all efficacy signals in the cancer treatment trajectory, provides clinically relevant reduction in required sample size and meaningfully expedites the efficacy signals of cancer treatments compared to KM PFS and KM OS. Using CWTA rather than KM as the primary trial outcome has the potential to meaningfully reduce the numbers of patients, trial duration, and costs to evaluate therapies in advanced cancer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory-Based Individualized Treatment Rules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09810v3)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A core component of precision medicine research involves optimizing individualized treatment rules (ITRs) based on patient characteristics. Many studies used to estimate ITRs are longitudinal in nature, collecting outcomes over time. Yet, to date, methods developed to estimate ITRs often ignore the longitudinal structure of the data. Information available from the longitudinal nature of the data can be especially useful in mental health studies. Although treatment means might appear similar, understanding the trajectory of outcomes over time can reveal important differences between treatments and placebo effects. This longitudinal perspective is especially beneficial in mental health research, where subtle shifts in outcome patterns can hold significant implications. Despite numerous studies involving the collection of outcome data across various time points, most precision medicine methods used to develop ITRs overlook the information available from the longitudinal structure. The prevalence of missing data in such studies exacerbates the issue, as neglecting the longitudinal nature of the data can significantly impair the effectiveness of treatment rules. This paper develops a powerful longitudinal trajectory-based ITR construction method that incorporates baseline variables, via a single-index or biosignature, into the modeling of longitudinal outcomes. This trajectory-based ITR approach substantially minimizes the negative impact of missing data compared to more traditional ITR approaches. The approach is illustrated through simulation studies and a clinical trial for depression, contrasting it with more traditional ITRs that ignore longitudinal information.</p></details> |  |

The conventional approach involves analyzing agent movements through three primary tasks: trajectory prediction, imputation, and spatial-temporal recovery. Considering the unique input formulation and constraint of these tasks, most existing methods are tailored to address only one specific task. However, in real-world applications, these scenarios frequently occur simultaneously. Consequently, methods designed for one task often fail to adapt to others, resulting in performance drops. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Unified Trajectory Generation model, UniTraj, that processes arbitrary trajectories as masked inputs, adaptable to diverse scenarios. Specifically, we introduce a Ghost Spatial Masking (GSM) module embedded within a Transformer encoder for spatial feature extraction. We further extend recent successful State Space Models (SSMs), particularly the Mamba model, into a Bidirectional Temporal Mamba to effectively capture temporal dependencies. Additionally, we incorporate a Bidirectional Temporal Scaled (BTS) module to comprehensively scan trajectories while maintaining the temporal missing relationships within the sequence. We curate and benchmark three practical sports game datasets, Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U, for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses this unified problem through a versatile generative framework, thereby enhancing our understanding of multi-agent movement.

However, calibrating stereo vision systems that incorporate both event and frame-based cameras remains a significant challenge. In this letter, we present EF-Calib, a spatiotemporal calibration framework for event- and frame-based cameras using continuous-time trajectories. A novel calibration pattern applicable to both camera types and the corresponding event recognition algorithm is proposed. Leveraging the asynchronous nature of events, a derivable piece-wise B-spline to represent camera pose continuously is introduced, enabling calibration for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset, with analytical Jacobians provided. Various experiments are carried out to evaluate the calibration performance of EF-Calib, including calibration experiments for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset. Experimental results show that EF-Calib achieves the most accurate intrinsic parameters compared to current SOTA, the close accuracy of the extrinsic parameters compared to the frame-based results, and accurate time offset estimation. EF-Calib provides a convenient and accurate toolbox for calibrating the system that fuses events and frames.

| **[SemanticFormer: Holistic and Semantic Traffic Scene Representation for Trajectory Prediction using Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19379v2)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction in autonomous driving relies on accurate representation of all relevant contexts of the driving scene, including traffic participants, road topology, traffic signs, as well as their semantic relations to each other. Despite increased attention to this issue, most approaches in trajectory prediction do not consider all of these factors sufficiently. We present SemanticFormer, an approach for predicting multimodal trajectories by reasoning over a semantic traffic scene graph using a hybrid approach. It utilizes high-level information in the form of meta-paths, i.e. trajectories on which an agent is allowed to drive from a knowledge graph which is then processed by a novel pipeline based on multiple attention mechanisms to predict accurate trajectories. SemanticFormer comprises a hierarchical heterogeneous graph encoder to capture spatio-temporal and relational information across agents as well as between agents and road elements. Further, it includes a predictor to fuse different encodings and decode trajectories with probabilities. Finally, a refinement module assesses permitted meta-paths of trajectories and speed profiles to obtain final predicted trajectories. Evaluation of the nuScenes benchmark demonstrates improved performance compared to several SOTA methods. In addition, we demonstrate that our knowledge graph can be easily added to two graph-based existing SOTA methods, namely VectorNet and Laformer, replacing their original homogeneous graphs. The evaluation results suggest that by adding our knowledge graph the performance of the original methods is enhanced by 5% and 4%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted to RA-L</p></details> |

This pattern is also often observed within-seasons as athlete aims for their performance to peak at key events such as the Olympic Games or World Championships. A Bayesian hierarchical model is developed to analyse the evolution of athletic sporting performance throughout an athlete's career and separate these effects whilst allowing for confounding factors such as environmental conditions. Our model works in continuous time and estimates both the average performance level of the population, $g(t)$, at age $t$ and how each $i$-th athlete differs from the average $f_i(t)$. We further decompose $f_i(t)$ into changes from season-to-season, termed the between-season performance trajectory, and within-season performance trajectories which are modelled by a constrained Bernstein polynomial. Hence, the specific focus of this project is to identify the differences in performance that exist both between and within-seasons for each athlete. For the implementation of the model an adaptive Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm is used. An illustration of algorithm's performance on 100 metres and 200 metres freestyle swimming in both female and male athletes is presented.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Data Suffices for Statistically Efficient Learning in Offline RL with Linear $q^π$-Realizability and Concentrability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16809v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider offline reinforcement learning (RL) in $H$-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) under the linear $q^\pi$-realizability assumption, where the action-value function of every policy is linear with respect to a given $d$-dimensional feature function. The hope in this setting is that learning a good policy will be possible without requiring a sample size that scales with the number of states in the MDP. Foster et al. [2021] have shown this to be impossible even under $\textit{concentrability}$, a data coverage assumption where a coefficient $C_\text{conc}$ bounds the extent to which the state-action distribution of any policy can veer off the data distribution. However, the data in this previous work was in the form of a sequence of individual transitions. This leaves open the question of whether the negative result mentioned could be overcome if the data was composed of sequences of full trajectories. In this work we answer this question positively by proving that with trajectory data, a dataset of size $\text{poly}(d,H,C_\text{conc})/\epsilon^2$ is sufficient for deriving an $\epsilon$-optimal policy, regardless of the size of the state space. The main tool that makes this result possible is due to Weisz et al. [2023], who demonstrate that linear MDPs can be used to approximate linearly $q^\pi$-realizable MDPs. The connection to trajectory data is that the linear MDP approximation relies on "skipping" over certain states. The associated estimation problems are thus easy when working with trajectory data, while they remain nontrivial when working with individual transitions. The question of computational efficiency under our assumptions remains open.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combining Constrained Diffusion Models and Numerical Solvers for Efficient and Robust Non-Convex Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05571v3)** | 2024-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the need to solve open-loop optimal control problems with computational efficiency and reliable constraint satisfaction, we introduce a general framework that combines diffusion models and numerical optimization solvers. Optimal control problems are rarely solvable in closed form, hence they are often transcribed into numerical trajectory optimization problems, which then require initial guesses. These initial guesses are supplied in our framework by diffusion models. To mitigate the effect of samples that violate the problem constraints, we develop a novel constrained diffusion model to approximate the true distribution of locally optimal solutions with an additional constraint violation loss in training. To further enhance the robustness, the diffusion samples as initial guesses are fed to the numerical solver to refine and derive final optimal (and hence feasible) solutions. Experimental evaluations on three tasks verify the improved constraint satisfaction and computational efficiency with 4$\times$ to 30$\times$ acceleration using our proposed framework, which generalizes across trajectory optimization problems and scales well with problem complexity.</p></details> |  |

We utilize OpenCV's CSRT algorithm to accurately track the baseball and fixed reference points in 2D video frames. These tracked pixel coordinates are then used as input features for our neural network model, which comprises multiple fully connected layers to map the 2D coordinates to 3D space. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled trajectories using a mean squared error loss function and the Adam optimizer, optimizing the network to minimize prediction errors. Our experimental results demonstrate that this approach achieves high accuracy in reconstructing 3D trajectories from 2D inputs. This method shows great potential for applications in sports analysis, coaching, and enhancing the accuracy of trajectory predictions in various sports.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlightPatchNet: Multi-Scale Patch Network with Differential Coding for Flight Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16200v1)** | 2024-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate multi-step flight trajectory prediction plays an important role in Air Traffic Control, which can ensure the safety of air transportation. Two main issues limit the flight trajectory prediction performance of existing works. The first issue is the negative impact on prediction accuracy caused by the significant differences in data range. The second issue is that real-world flight trajectories involve underlying temporal dependencies, and existing methods fail to reveal the hidden complex temporal variations and only extract features from one single time scale. To address the above issues, we propose FlightPatchNet, a multi-scale patch network with differential coding for flight trajectory prediction. Specifically, FlightPatchNet first utilizes the differential coding to encode the original values of longitude and latitude into first-order differences and generates embeddings for all variables at each time step. Then, a global temporal attention is introduced to explore the dependencies between different time steps. To fully explore the diverse temporal patterns in flight trajectories, a multi-scale patch network is delicately designed to serve as the backbone. The multi-scale patch network exploits stacked patch mixer blocks to capture inter- and intra-patch dependencies under different time scales, and further integrates multi-scale temporal features across different scales and variables. Finally, FlightPatchNet ensembles multiple predictors to make direct multi-step prediction. Extensive experiments on ADS-B datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the competitive baselines.

| **[Optimal Flow Matching: Learning Straight Trajectories in Just One Step](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13117v2)** | 2024-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the several recent years, there has been a boom in development of Flow Matching (FM) methods for generative modeling. One intriguing property pursued by the community is the ability to learn flows with straight trajectories which realize the Optimal Transport (OT) displacements. Straightness is crucial for the fast integration (inference) of the learned flow's paths. Unfortunately, most existing flow straightening methods are based on non-trivial iterative FM procedures which accumulate the error during training or exploit heuristics based on minibatch OT. To address these issues, we develop and theoretically justify the novel Optimal Flow Matching approach which allows recovering the straight OT displacement for the quadratic transport in just one FM step. The main idea of our approach is the employment of vector field for FM which are parameterized by convex functions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Delving into the Trajectory Long-tail Distribution for Muti-object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04700v2)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) is a critical area within computer vision, with a broad spectrum of practical implementations. Current research has primarily focused on the development of tracking algorithms and enhancement of post-processing techniques. Yet, there has been a lack of thorough examination concerning the nature of tracking data it self. In this study, we pioneer an exploration into the distribution patterns of tracking data and identify a pronounced long-tail distribution issue within existing MOT datasets. We note a significant imbalance in the distribution of trajectory lengths across different pedestrians, a phenomenon we refer to as ``pedestrians trajectory long-tail distribution''. Addressing this challenge, we introduce a bespoke strategy designed to mitigate the effects of this skewed distribution. Specifically, we propose two data augmentation strategies, including Stationary Camera View Data Augmentation (SVA) and Dynamic Camera View Data Augmentation (DVA) , designed for viewpoint states and the Group Softmax (GS) module for Re-ID. SVA is to backtrack and predict the pedestrian trajectory of tail classes, and DVA is to use diffusion model to change the background of the scene. GS divides the pedestrians into unrelated groups and performs softmax operation on each group individually. Our proposed strategies can be integrated into numerous existing tracking systems, and extensive experimentation validates the efficacy of our method in reducing the influence of long-tail distribution on multi-object tracking performance.

| **[Language-Driven Interactive Traffic Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15388v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic trajectory generation with natural language control is pivotal for advancing autonomous vehicle technology. However, previous methods focus on individual traffic participant trajectory generation, thus failing to account for the complexity of interactive traffic dynamics. In this work, we propose InteractTraj, the first language-driven traffic trajectory generator that can generate interactive traffic trajectories. InteractTraj interprets abstract trajectory descriptions into concrete formatted interaction-aware numerical codes and learns a mapping between these formatted codes and the final interactive trajectories. To interpret language descriptions, we propose a language-to-code encoder with a novel interaction-aware encoding strategy. To produce interactive traffic trajectories, we propose a code-to-trajectory decoder with interaction-aware feature aggregation that synergizes vehicle interactions with the environmental map and the vehicle moves. Extensive experiments show our method demonstrates superior performance over previous SoTA methods, offering a more realistic generation of interactive traffic trajectories with high controllability via diverse natural language commands.

| **[Trajectory-Based Multi-Objective Hyperparameter Optimization for Model Retraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15303v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training machine learning models inherently involves a resource-intensive and noisy iterative learning procedure that allows epoch-wise monitoring of the model performance. However, in multi-objective hyperparameter optimization scenarios, the insights gained from the iterative learning procedure typically remain underutilized. We notice that tracking the model performance across multiple epochs under a hyperparameter setting creates a trajectory in the objective space and that trade-offs along the trajectories are often overlooked despite their potential to offer valuable insights to decision-making for model retraining. Therefore, in this study, we propose to enhance the multi-objective hyperparameter optimization problem by having training epochs as an additional decision variable to incorporate trajectory information. Correspondingly, we present a novel trajectory-based multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithm characterized by two features: 1) an acquisition function that captures the improvement made by the predictive trajectory of any hyperparameter setting and 2) a multi-objective early stopping mechanism that determines when to terminate the trajectory to maximize epoch efficiency. Numerical experiments on diverse synthetic simulations and hyperparameter tuning benchmarks indicate that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-objective optimizers in both locating better trade-offs and tuning efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Drones Help Drones: A Collaborative Framework for Multi-Drone Object Trajectory Prediction and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14674v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative trajectory prediction can comprehensively forecast the future motion of objects through multi-view complementary information. However, it encounters two main challenges in multi-drone collaboration settings. The expansive aerial observations make it difficult to generate precise Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations. Besides, excessive interactions can not meet real-time prediction requirements within the constrained drone-based communication bandwidth. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework named "Drones Help Drones" (DHD). Firstly, we incorporate the ground priors provided by the drone's inclined observation to estimate the distance between objects and drones, leading to more precise BEV generation. Secondly, we design a selective mechanism based on the local feature discrepancy to prioritize the critical information contributing to prediction tasks during inter-drone interactions. Additionally, we create the first dataset for multi-drone collaborative prediction, named "Air-Co-Pred", and conduct quantitative and qualitative experiments to validate the effectiveness of our DHD framework.The results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art approaches, DHD reduces position deviation in BEV representations by over 20% and requires only a quarter of the transmission ratio for interactions while achieving comparable prediction performance. Moreover, DHD also shows promising generalization to the collaborative 3D object detection in CoPerception-UAVs.</p></details> |  |

The proposed model ensures the drivability of the predicted trajectory by integrating non-holonomic motion constraints and physical constraints into the generative prediction module. Central to the architecture of cVMD is its capacity to perform uncertainty quantification, a feature that is crucial in safety-critical applications. By integrating the quantified uncertainty into the prediction process, the cVMD's trajectory prediction performance is improved considerably. The model's performance was evaluated using the publicly available highD dataset. Experiments show that the proposed architecture achieves competitive trajectory prediction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models, while providing guaranteed drivable trajectories and uncertainty quantification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/CVF Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference Workshops (CVPRW) 2024</p></details> |

At the control center, offline motion planning is fundamental in the computation of optimized trajectories accounting for the system's constraints. Smooth movements, collision and forbidden areas avoidance, target visibility and energy consumption are all important factors to consider to be able to generate feasible and optimal plans. When mobile manipulators (terrestrial, aerial) are employed, the base and the arm movements are often separately planned, ultimately resulting in sub-optimal solutions. We propose an Optimal Whole Body Planner (OptiWB) based on Discrete Dynamic Programming (DDP) and optimal interpolation. Kinematic redundancy is exploited for collision and forbidden areas avoidance, and to improve target illumination and visibility from onboard cameras. The planner, implemented in ROS (Robot Operating System), interfaces 3DROCS, a mission planner used in several programs of the European Space Agency (ESA) to support planetary exploration surface missions and part of the ExoMars Rover's planning software. The proposed approach is exercised on a simplified version of the Analog-1 Interact rover by ESA, a 7-DOFs robotic arm mounted on a four wheels non-holonomic platform.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Volatility for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Mathematical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14039v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world data deviating from the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption of in-distribution training data poses security threats to deep networks, thus advancing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection algorithms. Detection methods in generative language models (GLMs) mainly focus on uncertainty estimation and embedding distance measurement, with the latter proven to be most effective in traditional linguistic tasks like summarization and translation. However, another complex generative scenario mathematical reasoning poses significant challenges to embedding-based methods due to its high-density feature of output spaces, but this feature causes larger discrepancies in the embedding shift trajectory between different samples in latent spaces. Hence, we propose a trajectory-based method TV score, which uses trajectory volatility for OOD detection in mathematical reasoning. Experiments show that our method outperforms all traditional algorithms on GLMs under mathematical reasoning scenarios and can be extended to more applications with high-density features in output spaces, such as multiple-choice questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 6 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

Existing traditional or learning-based methods face challenges in adequately addressing all these aspects. In response, this paper proposes a novel component termed the Logical Guidance Layer (LGL), designed for seamless integration into autonomous driving trajectory planning frameworks, specifically tailored for highway scenarios. The LGL guides the trajectory planning with a local target area determined through scenario reasoning, scenario evaluation, and guidance area calculation. Integrating the Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) model, the LGL ensures formal safety guarantees while accommodating various user preferences defined by logical formulae. Experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness of the LGL in achieving a balance between safety and efficiency, and meeting user preferences in autonomous highway driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ITSC 2024</p></details> |
| **[Hyper-SD: Trajectory Segmented Consistency Model for Efficient Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13686v2)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a series of diffusion-aware distillation algorithms have emerged to alleviate the computational overhead associated with the multi-step inference process of Diffusion Models (DMs). Current distillation techniques often dichotomize into two distinct aspects: i) ODE Trajectory Preservation; and ii) ODE Trajectory Reformulation. However, these approaches suffer from severe performance degradation or domain shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Hyper-SD, a novel framework that synergistically amalgamates the advantages of ODE Trajectory Preservation and Reformulation, while maintaining near-lossless performance during step compression. Firstly, we introduce Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation to progressively perform consistent distillation within pre-defined time-step segments, which facilitates the preservation of the original ODE trajectory from a higher-order perspective. Secondly, we incorporate human feedback learning to boost the performance of the model in a low-step regime and mitigate the performance loss incurred by the distillation process. Thirdly, we integrate score distillation to further improve the low-step generation capability of the model and offer the first attempt to leverage a unified LoRA to support the inference process at all steps. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that Hyper-SD achieves SOTA performance from 1 to 8 inference steps for both SDXL and SD1.5. For example, Hyper-SDXL surpasses SDXL-Lightning by +0.68 in CLIP Score and +0.51 in Aes Score in the 1-step inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://hyper-sd.github.io/</p></details> |

Many existing automatic methods focus on roughly controlling predefined shot types or movement patterns, which struggle to engage viewers with the circumstances of the actor. Real-world cinematographic rules show that directors can create immersion by comprehensively synchronizing the camera with the actor. Inspired by this strategy, we propose a deep camera control framework that enables actor-camera synchronization in three aspects, considering frame aesthetics, spatial action, and emotional status in the 3D virtual stage. Following rule-of-thirds, our framework first modifies the initial camera placement to position the actor aesthetically. This adjustment is facilitated by a self-supervised adjustor that analyzes frame composition via camera projection. We then design a GAN model that can adversarially synthesize fine-grained camera movement based on the physical action and psychological state of the actor, using an encoder-decoder generator to map kinematics and emotional variables into camera trajectories. Moreover, we incorporate a regularizer to align the generated stylistic variances with specific emotional categories and intensities. The experimental results show that our proposed method yields immersive cinematic videos of high quality, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Live examples can be found in the supplementary video.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Interaction Modeling with Agent Selection and Physical Methods for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13152v1)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we address the limitations inherent in most existing vehicle trajectory prediction methodologies that indiscriminately incorporate all agents within a predetermined proximity when accounting for inter-agent interactions. These approaches commonly employ attention-based architecture or graph neural networks for encoding interactions, which introduces three challenges: (i) The indiscriminate selection of all nearby agents substantially escalates the computational demands of the model, particularly in those interaction-rich scenarios. (ii) Moreover, the simplistic feature extraction of current time agents falls short of adequately capturing the nuanced dynamics of interactions. (iii) Compounded by the inherently low interpretability of attention mechanism and graph neural networks, there is a propensity for the model to allocate unreliable correlation coefficients to certain agents, adversely impacting the accuracy of trajectory predictions. To mitigate these issues, we introduce ASPILin, a novel approach that enhances the selection of interacting agents by considering their current and future lanes, extending this consideration across all historical frames. Utilizing the states of the agents, we estimate the nearest future distance between agents and the time needed to reach this distance. Then, combine these with their current distances to derive a physical correlation coefficient to encode interactions. Experiments conducted on popular trajectory prediction datasets demonstrate that our method is efficient and straightforward, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code:https://github.com/kkk00714/ASPILin</p></details> |

Developing a versatile trajectory learning approach that can adapt to different tasks while ensuring high accuracy is crucial. This requires effectively extracting movement patterns and travel purposes embedded in trajectories. However, this task is challenging due to limitations in the size and quality of available trajectory datasets. On the other hand, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown great success in adapting to different tasks by training on large-scale, high-quality corpus datasets. Given the similarities between trajectories and sentences, there is potential in leveraging PLMs to enhance the development of a versatile and effective trajectory learning method. Nevertheless, vanilla PLMs are not tailored to handle the unique spatio-temporal features present in trajectories and lack the capability to extract movement patterns and travel purposes from them. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a model called PLM4Traj that effectively utilizes PLMs to model trajectories. PLM4Traj leverages the strengths of PLMs to create a versatile trajectory learning approach while addressing the limitations of vanilla PLMs in modeling trajectories. Firstly, PLM4Traj incorporates a novel trajectory semantic embedder that enables PLMs to process spatio-temporal features in trajectories and extract movement patterns and travel purposes from them. Secondly, PLM4Traj introduces a novel trajectory prompt that integrates movement patterns and travel purposes into PLMs, while also allowing the model to adapt to various tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets and two representative tasks demonstrate that PLM4Traj successfully achieves its design goals.

However, there are still open questions about the effects of perturbations on inputs other than state histories, and how these attacks impact downstream planning and control. In this paper, we conduct a sensitivity analysis on two trajectory prediction models, Trajectron++ and AgentFormer. The analysis reveals that between all inputs, almost all of the perturbation sensitivities for both models lie only within the most recent position and velocity states. We additionally demonstrate that, despite dominant sensitivity on state history perturbations, an undetectable image map perturbation made with the Fast Gradient Sign Method can induce large prediction error increases in both models, revealing that these trajectory predictors are, in fact, susceptible to image-based attacks. Using an optimization-based planner and example perturbations crafted from sensitivity results, we show how these attacks can cause a vehicle to come to a sudden stop from moderate driving speeds.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 1 tables</p></details> |

Dynamic obstacles may also be interactive, i.e., their behavior varies based on the behavior of other entities. We propose a novel representation for interactive behavior of dynamic obstacles and a decentralized real-time multi-robot trajectory planning algorithm allowing inter-robot collision avoidance as well as static and dynamic obstacle avoidance. Our planner simulates the behavior of dynamic obstacles, accounting for interactivity. We account for the perception inaccuracy of static and prediction inaccuracy of dynamic obstacles. We handle asynchronous planning between teammates and message delays, drops, and re-orderings. We evaluate our algorithm in simulations using 25400 random cases and compare it against three state-of-the-art baselines using 2100 random cases. Our algorithm achieves up to 1.68x success rate using as low as 0.28x time in single-robot, and up to 2.15x success rate using as low as 0.36x time in multi-robot cases compared to the best baseline.

Mamba, a promising new linear-time sequence model, offers performance on par with transformers while delivering substantially fewer parameters on long sequences. As it remains unclear whether Mamba is compatible with trajectory optimization, this work aims to conduct comprehensive experiments to explore the potential of Decision Mamba in offline RL (dubbed DeMa) from the aspect of data structures and network architectures with the following insights: (1) Long sequences impose a significant computational burden without contributing to performance improvements due to the fact that DeMa's focus on sequences diminishes approximately exponentially. Consequently, we introduce a Transformer-like DeMa as opposed to an RNN-like DeMa. (2) For the components of DeMa, we identify that the hidden attention mechanism is key to its success, which can also work well with other residual structures and does not require position embedding. Extensive evaluations from eight Atari games demonstrate that our specially designed DeMa is compatible with trajectory optimization and surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods, outdoing Decision Transformer (DT) by 80\% with 30\% fewer parameters, and exceeds DT in MuJoCo with only a quarter of the parameters.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

We propose methods for clustering trajectory-states and sampling strategies in an active learning framework, aiming to reduce annotation and data costs while maintaining model performance. Our approach leverages trajectory information to guide data selection, promoting diversity in the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on the trajectory prediction task using the nuScenes dataset, showing consistent performance gains over random sampling across different data pool sizes, and even reaching sub-baseline displacement errors at just 50% of the data cost. Our results suggest that sampling typical data initially helps overcome the ''cold start problem,'' while introducing novelty becomes more beneficial as the training pool size increases. By integrating trajectory-state-informed active learning, we demonstrate that more efficient and robust autonomous driving systems are possible and practical using low-cost data curation strategies.</p></details> |  |

| **[AI Algorithm for Predicting and Optimizing Trajectory of UAV Swarm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11722v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques for generating the trajectories of fleets of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The two main challenges addressed include accurately predicting the paths of UAVs and efficiently avoiding collisions between them. Firstly, the paper systematically applies a diverse set of activation functions to a Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) with a single hidden layer, which enhances the accuracy of the predicted path compared to previous work. Secondly, we introduce a novel activation function, AdaptoSwelliGauss, which is a sophisticated fusion of Swish and Elliott activations, seamlessly integrated with a scaled and shifted Gaussian component. Swish facilitates smooth transitions, Elliott captures abrupt trajectory changes, and the scaled and shifted Gaussian enhances robustness against noise. This dynamic combination is specifically designed to excel in capturing the complexities of UAV trajectory prediction. This new activation function gives substantially better accuracy than all existing activation functions. Thirdly, we propose a novel Integrated Collision Detection, Avoidance, and Batching (ICDAB) strategy that merges two complementary UAV collision avoidance techniques: changing UAV trajectories and altering their starting times, also referred to as batching. This integration helps overcome the disadvantages of both - reduction in the number of trajectory manipulations, which avoids overly convoluted paths in the first technique, and smaller batch sizes, which reduce overall takeoff time in the second.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 Pa...</summary><p>24 Pages, 9 Tables, 6 Figures</p></details> |
| **[Semantic Trajectory Data Mining with LLM-Informed POI Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11715v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human travel trajectory mining is crucial for transportation systems, enhancing route optimization, traffic management, and the study of human travel patterns. Previous rule-based approaches without the integration of semantic information show a limitation in both efficiency and accuracy. Semantic information, such as activity types inferred from Points of Interest (POI) data, can significantly enhance the quality of trajectory mining. However, integrating these insights is challenging, as many POIs have incomplete feature information, and current learning-based POI algorithms require the integrity of datasets to do the classification. In this paper, we introduce a novel pipeline for human travel trajectory mining. Our approach first leverages the strong inferential and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to annotate POI with activity types and then uses a Bayesian-based algorithm to infer activity for each stay point in a trajectory. In our evaluation using the OpenStreetMap (OSM) POI dataset, our approach achieves a 93.4% accuracy and a 96.1% F-1 score in POI classification, and a 91.7% accuracy with a 92.3% F-1 score in activity inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Bayesian Nonparametric Approach for Clustering Functional Trajectories over Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11358v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional concurrent, or varying-coefficient, regression models are commonly used in biomedical and clinical settings to investigate how the relation between an outcome and observed covariate varies as a function of another covariate. In this work, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric approach to investigate how clusters of these functional relations evolve over time. Our model clusters individual functional trajectories within and across time periods while flexibly accommodating the evolution of the partitions across time periods with covariates. Motivated by mobile health data collected in a novel, smartphone-based smoking cessation intervention study, we demonstrate how our proposed method can simultaneously cluster functional trajectories, accommodate temporal dependence, and provide insights into the transitions between functional clusters over time.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Trajectory Regularity of ODE-based Diffusion Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11326v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models use stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and their equivalent ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to establish a smooth connection between a complex data distribution and a tractable prior distribution. In this paper, we identify several intriguing trajectory properties in the ODE-based sampling process of diffusion models. We characterize an implicit denoising trajectory and discuss its vital role in forming the coupled sampling trajectory with a strong shape regularity, regardless of the generated content. We also describe a dynamic programming-based scheme to make the time schedule in sampling better fit the underlying trajectory structure. This simple strategy requires minimal modification to any given ODE-based numerical solvers and incurs negligible computational cost, while delivering superior performance in image generation, especially in $5\sim 10$ function evaluations.</p></details> | ICML 2024, 30 pages |
| **[Dreamer XL: Towards High-Resolution Text-to-3D Generation via Trajectory Score Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11252v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a novel Trajectory Score Matching (TSM) method that aims to solve the pseudo ground truth inconsistency problem caused by the accumulated error in Interval Score Matching (ISM) when using the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion process. Unlike ISM which adopts the inversion process of DDIM to calculate on a single path, our TSM method leverages the inversion process of DDIM to generate two paths from the same starting point for calculation. Since both paths start from the same starting point, TSM can reduce the accumulated error compared to ISM, thus alleviating the problem of pseudo ground truth inconsistency. TSM enhances the stability and consistency of the model's generated paths during the distillation process. We demonstrate this experimentally and further show that ISM is a special case of TSM. Furthermore, to optimize the current multi-stage optimization process from high-resolution text to 3D generation, we adopt Stable Diffusion XL for guidance. In response to the issues of abnormal replication and splitting caused by unstable gradients during the 3D Gaussian splatting process when using Stable Diffusion XL, we propose a pixel-by-pixel gradient clipping method. Extensive experiments show that our model significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art models in terms of visual quality and performance.

| **[RuleFuser: Injecting Rules in Evidential Networks for Robust Out-of-Distribution Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11139v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern neural trajectory predictors in autonomous driving are developed using imitation learning (IL) from driving logs. Although IL benefits from its ability to glean nuanced and multi-modal human driving behaviors from large datasets, the resulting predictors often struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and with traffic rule compliance. On the other hand, classical rule-based predictors, by design, can predict traffic rule satisfying behaviors while being robust to OOD scenarios, but these predictors fail to capture nuances in agent-to-agent interactions and human driver's intent. In this paper, we present RuleFuser, a posterior-net inspired evidential framework that combines neural predictors with classical rule-based predictors to draw on the complementary benefits of both, thereby striking a balance between performance and traffic rule compliance. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated on the real-world nuPlan dataset where RuleFuser leverages the higher performance of the neural predictor in in-distribution (ID) scenarios and the higher safety offered by the rule-based predictor in OOD scenarios.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

This report investigates the potential of deploying a fully actuated Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) for shallow area exploration beneath ice sheets. Leveraging advancements in marine robotics technology, ROVs offer a promising solution for extending human presence into remote underwater locations. To enable successful under-ice exploration, the ROV must follow precise trajectories for effective localization signal reception. This study develops a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear system controller, incorporating a Lyapunov-based stability guarantee and an adaptation law to mitigate unknown environmental disturbances. Fuzzy logic is employed to dynamically adjust adaptation rates, enhancing performance in highly nonlinear ROV dynamic systems. Additionally, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm automates the tuning of controller parameters for optimal trajectory tracking. The report details the ROV dynamic model, the proposed control framework, and the PSO-based tuning process. Simulation-based experiments validate the efficacy of the methodology, with experimental results demonstrating superior trajectory tracking performance compared to baseline controllers. This work contributes to the advancement of under-ice exploration capabilities and sets the stage for future research in marine robotics and autonomous underwater systems.</p></details> |  |

Despite this recent upsurge, this area is still rarely systematically studied. In this paper, we provide an extensive survey, investigating CRL methods based on both interactive reinforcement learning algorithms and human-AI collaborative frameworks that were proposed in the past decade. We elucidate and discuss via synergistic analysis methods both the growth of the field and the state-of-the-art; we conceptualise the existing frameworks from the perspectives of design patterns, collaborative levels, parties and capabilities, and review interactive methods and algorithmic models. Specifically, we create a new Human-AI CRL Design Trajectory Map, as a systematic modelling tool for the selection of existing CRL frameworks, as well as a method of designing new CRL systems, and finally of improving future CRL designs. Furthermore, we elaborate generic Human-AI CRL challenges, providing the research community with a guide towards novel research directions. The aim of this paper is to empower researchers with a systematic framework for the design of efficient and 'natural' human-AI collaborative methods, making it possible to work on maximised realisation of humans' and AI's potentials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Maritime Trajectory Forecasting via H3 Index and Causal Language Modelling (CLM)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09596v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prediction of ship trajectories is a growing field of study in artificial intelligence. Traditional methods rely on the use of LSTM, GRU networks, and even Transformer architectures for the prediction of spatio-temporal series. This study proposes a viable alternative for predicting these trajectories using only GNSS positions. It considers this spatio-temporal problem as a natural language processing problem. The latitude/longitude coordinates of AIS messages are transformed into cell identifiers using the H3 index. Thanks to the pseudo-octal representation, it becomes easier for language models to learn the spatial hierarchy of the H3 index. The method is compared with a classical Kalman filter, widely used in the maritime domain, and introduces the Fr\'echet distance as the main evaluation metric. We show that it is possible to predict ship trajectories quite precisely up to 8 hours with 30 minutes of context. We demonstrate that this alternative works well enough to predict trajectories worldwide.</p></details> | 22 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Application of Gated Recurrent Units for CT Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09333v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in computed tomography (CT) imaging, especially with dual-robot systems, have introduced new challenges for scan trajectory optimization. This paper presents a novel approach using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to optimize CT scan trajectories. Our approach exploits the flexibility of robotic CT systems to select projections that enhance image quality by improving resolution and contrast while reducing scan time. We focus on cone-beam CT and employ several projection-based metrics, including absorption, pixel intensities, contrast-to-noise ratio, and data completeness. The GRU network aims to minimize data redundancy and maximize completeness with a limited number of projections. We validate our method using simulated data of a test specimen, focusing on a specific voxel of interest. The results show that the GRU-optimized scan trajectories can outperform traditional circular CT trajectories in terms of image quality metrics. For the used specimen, SSIM improves from 0.38 to 0.49 and CNR increases from 6.97 to 9.08. This finding suggests that the application of GRU in CT scan trajectory optimization can lead to more efficient, cost-effective, and high-quality imaging solutions.</p></details> | 4 pages, 6 figures |

The handwritten recognition is one of the useful area in real life use where both offline and online handwriting recognition are required. The chain code as feature extraction technique has shown significant results in literature and we have been able to use chain codes with graph neural networks. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents first time a novel combination of handwritten trajectories features as chain codes and graph neural networks together. The handwritten trajectories for offline handwritten text has been evaluated using recovery of drawing order, whereas online handwritten trajectories are directly used with chain codes. Our results prove that present combination surpass previous results and minimize error rate in few epochs only.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOMTP: Self-Supervised Learning-Based Optimizer for MPC-Based Safe Trajectory Planning Problems in Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09212v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based trajectory planning has been widely used in robotics, and incorporating Control Barrier Function (CBF) constraints into MPC can greatly improve its obstacle avoidance efficiency. Unfortunately, traditional optimizers are resource-consuming and slow to solve such non-convex constrained optimization problems (COPs) while learning-based methods struggle to satisfy the non-convex constraints. In this paper, we propose SOMTP algorithm, a self-supervised learning-based optimizer for CBF-MPC trajectory planning. Specifically, first, SOMTP employs problem transcription to satisfy most of the constraints. Then the differentiable SLPG correction is proposed to move the solution closer to the safe set and is then converted as the guide policy in the following training process. After that, inspired by the Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM), our training algorithm integrated with guide policy constraints is proposed to enable the optimizer network to converge to a feasible solution. Finally, experiments show that the proposed algorithm has better feasibility than other learning-based methods and can provide solutions much faster than traditional optimizers with similar optimality.</p></details> |  |

Prompted by the need for dependable uncertainty estimates in motion planning applications where the behavior of diverse objects may be more or less unpredictable, we blend different techniques from online conformal prediction of single and multiple time series, as well as ideas for addressing heteroscedasticity in regression. This solution is both principled, providing precise finite-sample guarantees, and effective, often leading to more informative predictions than prior methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dim Small Target Detection and Tracking: A Novel Method Based on Temporal Energy Selective Scaling and Trajectory Association](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09054v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The detection and tracking of small targets in passive optical remote sensing (PORS) has broad applications. However, most of the previously proposed methods seldom utilize the abundant temporal features formed by target motion, resulting in poor detection and tracking performance for low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) targets. In this article, we analyze the difficulty based on spatial features and the feasibility based on temporal features of realizing effective detection. According to this analysis, we use a multi-frame as a detection unit and propose a detection method based on temporal energy selective scaling (TESS). Specifically, we investigated the composition of intensity temporal profiles (ITPs) formed by pixels on a multi-frame detection unit. For the target-present pixel, the target passing through the pixel will bring a weak transient disturbance on the ITP and introduce a change in the statistical properties of ITP. We use a well-designed function to amplify the transient disturbance, suppress the background and noise components, and output the trajectory of the target on the multi-frame detection unit. Subsequently, to solve the contradiction between the detection rate and the false alarm rate brought by the traditional threshold segmentation, we associate the temporal and spatial features of the output trajectory and propose a trajectory extraction method based on the 3D Hough transform. Finally, we model the trajectory of the target and propose a trajectory-based multi-target tracking method. Compared with the various state-of-the-art detection and tracking methods, experiments in multiple scenarios prove the superiority of our proposed methods.</p></details> |  |

To address this constraint, we propose a derivative-based lifting function construction method, show that the corresponding infinite dimensional Koopman bilinear model over the lifting function is equivalent to the original control-affine system. Further, we analyze the propagation and bounds of state prediction errors caused by the truncation in derivative order. The identified finite dimensional Koopman bilinear model would serve as predictive model in the next step. Koopman Bilinear Model Predictive control (K-BMPC) is proposed to solve the trajectory tracking problem. We linearize the bilinear model around the estimation of the lifted state and control input. Then the bilinear Model Predictive Control problem is approximated by a quadratic programming problem. Further, the estimation is updated at each iteration until the convergence is reached. Moreover, we implement our algorithm on a tractor-trailer system, taking into account the longitudinal and side slip effects. The open-loop simulation shows the proposed Koopman bilinear model captures the dynamics with unknown parameters and has good prediction performance. Closed-loop tracking results show the proposed K-BMPC exhibits elevated tracking precision with the commendable computational efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of K-BMPC.</p></details> |  |

In this framework, a terrestrial-aerial path-searching method with the crawling limitation of HyFCQs is proposed to guarantee the dynamical feasibility of trajectories. Additionally, a trajectory tracking method is proposed to address the challenges associated with the deformation time required by HyFCQs, which makes tracking hybrid trajectories at the junction between terrestrial and aerial segments difficult. Simulations and real-world experiments in diverse scenarios validate the exceptional performance of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReeSPOT: Reeb Graph Models Semantic Patterns of Normalcy in Human Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00808v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces ReeSPOT, a novel Reeb graph-based method to model patterns of life in human trajectories (akin to a fingerprint). Human behavior typically follows a pattern of normalcy in day-to-day activities. This is marked by recurring activities within specific time periods. In this paper, we model this behavior using Reeb graphs where any deviation from usual day-to-day activities is encoded as nodes in the Reeb graph. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear with respect to the number of time points in a given trajectory. We demonstrate the usage of ReeSPOT and how it captures the critically significant spatial and temporal deviations using the nodes of the Reeb graph. Our case study presented in this paper includes realistic human movement scenarios: visiting uncommon locations, taking odd routes at infrequent times, uncommon time visits, and uncommon stay durations. We analyze the Reeb graph to interpret the topological structure of the GPS trajectories. Potential applications of ReeSPOT include urban planning, security surveillance, and behavioral research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Plan Maneuverable and Agile Flight Trajectory with Optimization Embedded Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07736v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent times, an increasing number of researchers have been devoted to utilizing deep neural networks for end-to-end flight navigation. This approach has gained traction due to its ability to bridge the gap between perception and planning that exists in traditional methods, thereby eliminating delays between modules. However, the practice of replacing original modules with neural networks in a black-box manner diminishes the overall system's robustness and stability. It lacks principled explanations and often fails to consistently generate high-quality motion trajectories. Furthermore, such methods often struggle to rigorously account for the robot's kinematic constraints, resulting in the generation of trajectories that cannot be executed satisfactorily. In this work, we combine the advantages of traditional methods and neural networks by proposing an optimization-embedded neural network. This network can learn high-quality trajectories directly from visual inputs without the need of mapping, while ensuring dynamic feasibility. Here, the deep neural network is employed to directly extract environment safety regions from depth images. Subsequently, we employ a model-based approach to represent these regions as safety constraints in trajectory optimization. Leveraging the availability of highly efficient optimization algorithms, our method robustly converges to feasible and optimal solutions that satisfy various user-defined constraints. Moreover, we differentiate the optimization process, allowing it to be trained as a layer within the neural network. This approach facilitates the direct interaction between perception and planning, enabling the network to focus more on the spatial regions where optimal solutions exist. As a result, it further enhances the quality and stability of the generated trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/e2e_opt</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Similarity Measurement: An Efficiency Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00960v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectories that capture object movement have numerous applications, in which similarity computation between trajectories often plays a key role. Traditionally, the similarity between two trajectories is quantified by means of heuristic measures, e.g., Hausdorff or ERP, that operate directly on the trajectories. In contrast, recent studies exploit deep learning to map trajectories to d-dimensional vectors, called embeddings. Then, some distance measure, e.g., Manhattan or Euclidean, is applied to the embeddings to quantify trajectory similarity. The resulting similarities are inaccurate: they only approximate the similarities obtained using the heuristic measures. As distance computation on embeddings is efficient, focus has been on achieving embeddings yielding high accuracy. Adopting an efficiency perspective, we analyze the time complexities of both the heuristic and the learning-based approaches, finding that the time complexities of the former approaches are not necessarily higher. Through extensive experiments on open datasets, we find that, on both CPUs and GPUs, only a few learning-based approaches can deliver the promised higher efficiency, when the embeddings can be pre-computed, while heuristic approaches are more efficient for one-off computations. Among the learning-based approaches, the self-attention-based ones are the fastest to learn embeddings that also yield the highest accuracy for similarity queries. These results have implications for the use of trajectory similarity approaches given different application requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VLDB 2024</p></details> |
| **[Fighter flight trajectory prediction based on spatio-temporal graphcial attention network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08034v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quickly and accurately predicting the flight trajectory of a blue army fighter in close-range air combat helps a red army fighter gain a dominant situation, which is the winning factor in later air combat. However,due to the high speed and even hypersonic capabilities of advanced fighters, the diversity of tactical maneuvers,and the instantaneous nature of situational transitions,it is difficult to meet the requirements of practical combat applications in terms of prediction accuracy.To improve prediction accuracy,this paper proposes a spatio-temporal graph attention network (ST-GAT) using encoding and decoding structures to predict the flight trajectory. The encoder adopts a parallel structure of Transformer and GAT branches embedded with the multi-head self-attention mechanism in each front end. The Transformer branch network is used to extract the temporal characteristics of historical trajectories and capture the impact of the fighter's historical state on future trajectories, while the GAT branch network is used to extract spatial features in historical trajectories and capture potential spatial correlations between fighters.Then we concatenate the outputs of the two branches into a new feature vector and input it into a decoder composed of a fully connected network to predict the future position coordinates of the blue army fighter.The computer simulation results show that the proposed network significantly improves the prediction accuracy of flight trajectories compared to the enhanced CNN-LSTM network (ECNN-LSTM), with improvements of 47% and 34% in both ADE and FDE indicators,providing strong support for subsequent autonomous combat missions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Vehicle Using Iterative Reward Prediction in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12079v4)** | 2024-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional trajectory planning methods for autonomous vehicles have several limitations. For example, heuristic and explicit simple rules limit generalizability and hinder complex motions. These limitations can be addressed using reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning. However, reinforcement learning suffers from unstable learning, and existing reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning methods do not consider the uncertainties. Thus, this paper, proposes a reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning method for autonomous vehicles. The proposed method involves an iterative reward prediction approach that iteratively predicts expectations of future states. These predicted states are then used to forecast rewards and integrated into the learning process to enhance stability. Additionally, a method is proposed that utilizes uncertainty propagation to make the reinforcement learning agent aware of uncertainties. The proposed method was evaluated using the CARLA simulator. Compared to the baseline methods, the proposed method reduced the collision rate by 60.17 %, and increased the average reward by 30.82 times.

| **[Modeling Pedestrian Intrinsic Uncertainty for Multimodal Stochastic Trajectory Prediction via Energy Plan Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07164v1)** | 2024-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction plays a pivotal role in the realms of autonomous driving and smart cities. Despite extensive prior research employing sequence and generative models, the unpredictable nature of pedestrians, influenced by their social interactions and individual preferences, presents challenges marked by uncertainty and multimodality. In response, we propose the Energy Plan Denoising (EPD) model for stochastic trajectory prediction. EPD initially provides a coarse estimation of the distribution of future trajectories, termed the Plan, utilizing the Langevin Energy Model. Subsequently, it refines this estimation through denoising via the Probabilistic Diffusion Model. By initiating denoising with the Plan, EPD effectively reduces the need for iterative steps, thereby enhancing efficiency. Furthermore, EPD differs from conventional approaches by modeling the distribution of trajectories instead of individual trajectories. This allows for the explicit modeling of pedestrian intrinsic uncertainties and eliminates the need for multiple denoising operations. A single denoising operation produces a distribution from which multiple samples can be drawn, significantly enhancing efficiency. Moreover, EPD's fine-tuning of the Plan contributes to improved model performance. We validate EPD on two publicly available datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art results. Additionally, ablation experiments underscore the contributions of individual modules, affirming the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction via Distributional Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08367v2)** | 2024-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tremendous efforts have been put forth on predicting pedestrian trajectory with generative models to accommodate uncertainty and multi-modality in human behaviors. An individual's inherent uncertainty, e.g., change of destination, can be masked by complex patterns resulting from the movements of interacting pedestrians. However, latent variable-based generative models often entangle such uncertainty with complexity, leading to limited either latent expressivity or predictive diversity. In this work, we propose to separately model these two factors by implicitly deriving a flexible latent representation to capture intricate pedestrian movements, while integrating predictive uncertainty of individuals with explicit bivariate Gaussian mixture densities over their future locations. More specifically, we present a model-agnostic uncertainty-aware pedestrian trajectory prediction framework, parameterizing sufficient statistics for the mixture of Gaussians that jointly comprise the multi-modal trajectories. We further estimate these parameters of interest by approximating a denoising process that progressively recovers pedestrian movements from noise. Unlike previous studies, we translate the predictive stochasticity to explicit distributions, allowing it to readily generate plausible future trajectories indicating individuals' self-uncertainty. Moreover, our framework is compatible with different neural net architectures. We empirically show the performance gains over state-of-the-art even with lighter backbones, across most scenes on two public benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

The motion prediction of pedestrians and vehicles helps emergency braking, reduces collisions, and improves traffic safety. Current trajectory prediction research faces problems of complex social interactions, high dynamics and multi-modality. Especially, it still has limitations in long-time prediction. We propose Attention-aware Social Graph Transformer Networks for multi-modal trajectory prediction. We combine Graph Convolutional Networks and Transformer Networks by generating stable resolution pseudo-images from Spatio-temporal graphs through a designed stacking and interception method. Furthermore, we design the attention-aware module to handle social interaction information in scenarios involving mixed pedestrian-vehicle traffic. Thus, we maintain the advantages of the Graph and Transformer, i.e., the ability to aggregate information over an arbitrary number of neighbors and the ability to perform complex time-dependent data processing. We conduct experiments on datasets involving pedestrian, vehicle, and mixed trajectories, respectively. Our results demonstrate that our model minimizes displacement errors across various metrics and significantly reduces the likelihood of collisions. It is worth noting that our model effectively reduces the final displacement error, illustrating the ability of our model to predict for a long time.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

First, the detection network estimates the objects position and orientation in the image space. Furthermore, these are normalized and filtered. The direction and orientation is then the input to the trajectory planner, which considers the kinematic constrains of the used robotic system. This allows safe and stable control, since the kinematic boundary values are taken into account in planning. Also, by having direction estimation and velocity planner separated, the learning part of the method does not directly influence the control value. This also enables the transfer of the method to different robotic systems without retraining, therefore being robot agnostic. We evaluate our method on different visual servoing tasks with and without clutter on two different robotic systems. Our method achieved mean absolute position errors of <0.5 mm and orientation errors of <1{\deg}. Additionally, we transferred the method to a new system which differs in robot and camera, emphasizing robot agnostic capability of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

We refer to these node-specific row vectors as Krylov subspace trajectories. While power iteration using a random initial starting vector is commonly applied to the network adjacency matrix to compute eigenvector centrality values, this application only uses the final vector generated after numerical convergence. Importantly, use of a random initial vector means that the intermediate results of power iteration are also random and lack a clear interpretation. To the best of our knowledge, use of intermediate power iteration results for network analysis has been limited to techniques that leverage just a single pre-convergence solution, e.g., Power Iteration Clustering. In this paper, we explore methods that apply power iteration with a non-random inital vector to the network adjacency matrix to generate Krylov subspace trajectories for each node. These non-random trajectories provide important information regarding network structure, node importance, and response to perturbations. We have created this short preprint in part to generate feedback from others in the network analysis community who might be aware of similar existing work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Creating Geospatial Trajectories from Human Trafficking Text Corpora](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06130v1)** | 2024-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trafficking is a crime that affects the lives of millions of people across the globe. Traffickers exploit the victims through forced labor, involuntary sex, or organ harvesting. Migrant smuggling could also be seen as a form of human trafficking when the migrant fails to pay the smuggler and is forced into coerced activities. Several news agencies and anti-trafficking organizations have reported trafficking survivor stories that include the names of locations visited along the trafficking route. Identifying such routes can provide knowledge that is essential to preventing such heinous crimes. In this paper we propose a Narrative to Trajectory (N2T) information extraction system that analyzes reported narratives, extracts relevant information through the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, and applies geospatial augmentation in order to automatically plot trajectories of human trafficking routes. We evaluate N2T on human trafficking text corpora and demonstrate that our approach of utilizing data preprocessing and augmenting database techniques with NLP libraries outperforms existing geolocation detection methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Narrative to Trajectory (N2T+): Extracting Routes of Life or Death from Human Trafficking Text Corpora](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06129v1)** | 2024-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Climate change and political unrest in certain regions of the world are imposing extreme hardship on many communities and are forcing millions of vulnerable populations to abandon their homelands and seek refuge in safer lands. As international laws are not fully set to deal with the migration crisis, people are relying on networks of exploiting smugglers to escape the devastation in order to live in stability. During the smuggling journey, migrants can become victims of human trafficking if they fail to pay the smuggler and may be forced into coerced labor. Government agencies and anti-trafficking organizations try to identify the trafficking routes based on stories of survivors in order to gain knowledge and help prevent such crimes. In this paper, we propose a system called Narrative to Trajectory (N2T+), which extracts trajectories of trafficking routes. N2T+ uses Data Science and Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze trafficking narratives, automatically extract relevant location names, disambiguate possible name ambiguities, and plot the trafficking route on a map. In a comparative evaluation we show that the proposed multi-dimensional approach offers significantly higher geolocation detection than other state of the art techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Almost Global Asymptotic Trajectory Tracking for Fully-Actuated Mechanical Systems on Homogeneous Riemannian Manifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04900v2)** | 2024-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we address the design of tracking controllers that drive a mechanical system's state asymptotically towards a reference trajectory. Motivated by aerospace and robotics applications, we consider fully-actuated systems evolving on the broad class of homogeneous spaces (encompassing all vector spaces, Lie groups, and spheres of any finite dimension). In this setting, the transitive action of a Lie group on the configuration manifold enables an intrinsic description of the tracking error as an element of the state space, even in the absence of a group structure on the configuration manifold itself (e.g., for $\mathbb{S}^2$). Such an error state facilitates the design of a generalized control policy depending smoothly on state and time, which drives the geometric tracking error to a designated origin from almost every initial condition, thereby guaranteeing almost global convergence to the reference trajectory. Moreover, the proposed controller simplifies elegantly when specialized to a Lie group or the n-sphere. In summary, we propose a unified, intrinsic controller guaranteeing almost global asymptotic trajectory tracking for fully-actuated mechanical systems evolving on a broad class of manifolds. We apply the method to an axisymmetric satellite and an omnidirectional aerial robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, sending raw data containing personal, sensitive information to cloud computing nodes may lead to privacy exposure issue.The privacy-preserving matrix completion is a useful approach to perform matrix completion while preserving privacy. In this paper, we propose a high-performance method for privacy-preserving matrix completion. First,we use a lightweight encryption scheme to encrypt the raw data and then perform matrix completion using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Then,the complemented matrix is decrypted and compared with the original matrix to calculate the error. This method has faster speed with higher accuracy. The results of numerical experiments reveal that the proposed method is faster than other algorithms.</p></details> | 7 pages, 10 figures |

Though existing notable efforts have resulted in impressive performance improvements, a gap persists in scene cognitive and understanding of the complex traffic semantics. This paper proposes Traj-LLM, the first to investigate the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) without explicit prompt engineering to generate future motion from agents' past/observed trajectories and scene semantics. Traj-LLM starts with sparse context joint coding to dissect the agent and scene features into a form that LLMs understand. On this basis, we innovatively explore LLMs' powerful comprehension abilities to capture a spectrum of high-level scene knowledge and interactive information. Emulating the human-like lane focus cognitive function and enhancing Traj-LLM's scene comprehension, we introduce lane-aware probabilistic learning powered by the pioneering Mamba module. Finally, a multi-modal Laplace decoder is designed to achieve scene-compliant multi-modal predictions. Extensive experiments manifest that Traj-LLM, fortified by LLMs' strong prior knowledge and understanding prowess, together with lane-aware probability learning, outstrips state-of-the-art methods across evaluation metrics. Moreover, the few-shot analysis further substantiates Traj-LLM's performance, wherein with just 50% of the dataset, it outperforms the majority of benchmarks relying on complete data utilization. This study explores equipping the trajectory prediction task with advanced capabilities inherent in LLMs, furnishing a more universal and adaptable solution for forecasting agent motion in a new way.</p></details> |  |

To enhance similarity measurement across diverse contexts, invariant motion descriptors have been proposed. However, for rigid-body motion, few invariant descriptors exist that are bi-invariant, meaning invariant to both the body and world reference frames used to describe the motion. Moreover, their robustness to singularities is limited. This paper introduces a novel Bi-Invariant Local Trajectory-Shape descriptor (BILTS) and a corresponding dissimilarity measure. Mathematical relationships between BILTS and existing descriptors are derived, providing new insights into their properties. The paper also includes an algorithm to reproduce the motion from the BILTS descriptor, demonstrating its bidirectionality and usefulness for trajectory generation. Experimental validation using datasets of daily-life activities shows the higher robustness of the BILTS descriptor compared to the bi-invariant ISA descriptor. This higher robustness supports the further application of bi-invariant descriptors for motion recognition and generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted as a regular research paper for consideration in the IEEE Transactions on Robotics.

There exists many algorithms where these parameters are estimated using least-squares in a first, pre-processing, step, including subspace identification and multi-step least-squares algorithms, such as Weighted Null-Space Fitting. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in non-asymptotic analysis of estimation algorithms. In this contribution we identify the Markov parameters using weighted least-squares and present non-asymptotic analysis for such estimator. To cover both stable and unstable systems, multiple trajectories are collected. We show that with the optimal weighting matrix, weighted least-squares gives a tighter error bound than ordinary least-squares for the case of non-uniformly distributed measurement errors. Moreover, as the optimal weighting matrix depends on the system's true parameters, we introduce two methods to consistently estimate the optimal weighting matrix, where the convergence rate of these estimates is also provided. Numerical experiments demonstrate improvements of weighted least-squares over ordinary least-squares in finite sample settings.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods overlook complex interactions between traffic participants that often govern their future trajectories. In this paper, we propose SocialFormer, an agent interaction-aware trajectory prediction method that leverages the semantic relationship between the target vehicle and surrounding vehicles by making use of the road topology. We also introduce an edge-enhanced heterogeneous graph transformer (EHGT) as the aggregator in a graph neural network (GNN) to encode the semantic and spatial agent interaction information. Additionally, we introduce a temporal encoder based on gated recurrent units (GRU) to model the temporal social behavior of agent movements. Finally, we present an information fusion framework that integrates agent encoding, lane encoding, and agent interaction encoding for a holistic representation of the traffic scene. We evaluate SocialFormer for the trajectory prediction task on the popular nuScenes benchmark and achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

Our approach models all driving scenario elements in a unified model: the position of new agents, their initial state, and their future motion trajectories. By predicting the distributions of all these variables from a shared global scenario embedding, we ensure that the final generated scenario is fully conditioned on all available context in the existing scene. Our unified modeling approach, combined with autoregressive agent injection, conditions the placement and motion trajectory of every new agent on all existing agents and their trajectories, leading to realistic scenarios with low collision rates. Our experimental results show that UniGen outperforms prior state of the art on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICRA 2024</p></details> |

However, these methods do not model constraints crucial to ensure safety of the learned skill. Moreover, even when explicitly modelling constraints, they rely on the assumption of a known cost function, which limits their practical usability for task with unknown cost. In this work we propose a two-step optimization process that allow to estimate cost and constraints by decoupling the learning of cost functions from the identification of unknown constraints within the demonstrated trajectories. Initially, we identify the cost function by isolating the effect of constraints on parts of the demonstrations. Subsequently, a constraint leaning method is used to identify the unknown constraints. Our approach is validated both on simulated trajectories and a real robotic manipulation task. Our experiments show the impact that incorrect cost estimation has on the learned constraints and illustrate how the proposed method is able to infer unknown constraints, such as obstacles, from demonstrated trajectories without any initial knowledge of the cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |

Due to the limited acquisition capabilities of edge devices, a lot of trajectories are recorded at a low sampling rate, which may lead to the effectiveness drop of urban applications. We aim to recover a high-sampled trajectory based on the low-sampled trajectory in free space, i.e., without road network information, to enhance the usability of trajectory data and support urban applications more effectively. Recent proposals targeting trajectory recovery often assume that trajectories are available at a central location, which fail to handle the decentralized trajectories and hurt privacy. To bridge the gap between decentralized training and trajectory recovery, we propose a lightweight framework, LightTR, for federated trajectory recovery based on a client-server architecture, while keeping the data decentralized and private in each client/platform center (e.g., each data center of a company). Specifically, considering the limited processing capabilities of edge devices, LightTR encompasses a light local trajectory embedding module that offers improved computational efficiency without compromising its feature extraction capabilities. LightTR also features a meta-knowledge enhanced local-global training scheme to reduce communication costs between the server and clients and thus further offer efficiency improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was accepted by ICDE 2024</p></details> |
| **[REPLAY: Modeling Time-Varying Temporal Regularities of Human Mobility for Location Prediction over Sparse Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16310v2)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Location prediction forecasts a user's location based on historical user mobility traces. To tackle the intrinsic sparsity issue of real-world user mobility traces, spatiotemporal contexts have been shown as significantly useful. Existing solutions mostly incorporate spatiotemporal distances between locations in mobility traces, either by feeding them as additional inputs to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or by using them to search for informative past hidden states for prediction. However, such distance-based methods fail to capture the time-varying temporal regularities of human mobility, where human mobility is often more regular in the morning than in other periods, for example; this suggests the usefulness of the actual timestamps besides the temporal distances. Against this background, we propose REPLAY, a general RNN architecture learning to capture the time-varying temporal regularities for location prediction. Specifically, REPLAY not only resorts to the spatiotemporal distances in sparse trajectories to search for the informative past hidden states, but also accommodates the time-varying temporal regularities by incorporating smoothed timestamp embeddings using Gaussian weighted averaging with timestamp-specific learnable bandwidths, which can flexibly adapt to the temporal regularities of different strengths across different timestamps. Our extensive evaluation compares REPLAY against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on two real-world datasets. Results show that REPLAY consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.7\%-10.9\% in the location prediction task, and the bandwidths reveal interesting patterns of the time-varying temporal regularities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unscented Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02753v1)** | 2024-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a nutshell, unscented trajectory optimization is the generation of optimal trajectories through the use of an unscented transform. Although unscented trajectory optimization was introduced by the authors about a decade ago, it is reintroduced in this paper as a special instantiation of tychastic optimal control theory. Tychastic optimal control theory (from \textit{Tyche}, the Greek goddess of chance) avoids the use of a Brownian motion and the resulting It\^{o} calculus even though it uses random variables across the entire spectrum of a problem formulation. This approach circumvents the enormous technical and numerical challenges associated with stochastic trajectory optimization. Furthermore, it is shown how a tychastic optimal control problem that involves nonlinear transformations of the expectation operator can be quickly instantiated using an unscented transform. These nonlinear transformations are particularly useful in managing trajectory dispersions be it associated with path constraints or targeted values of final-time conditions. This paper also presents a systematic and rapid process for formulating and computing the most desirable tychastic trajectory using an unscented transform. Numerical examples are used to illustrate how unscented trajectory optimization may be used for risk reduction and mission recovery caused by uncertainties and failures.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 11 figures 2023 AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference, Big Sky, MT, Aug 13-17, 2023</p></details> |

This paper presents a deep representation learningbased phenotyping method to identify distinct groups of clinical trajectories of septic patients with ARF. For this retrospective study, we created a dataset from electronic medical records (EMR) consisting of data from sepsis patients admitted to medical intensive care units who required at least 24 hours of invasive mechanical ventilation at a quarternary care academic hospital in southeast USA for the years 2016-2021. A total of N=3349 patient encounters were included in this study. Clustering Representation Learning on Incomplete Time Series Data (CRLI) algorithm was applied to a parsimonious set of EMR variables in this data set. To validate the optimal number of clusters, the K-means algorithm was used in conjunction with dynamic time warping. Our model yielded four distinct patient phenotypes that were characterized as liver dysfunction/heterogeneous, hypercapnia, hypoxemia, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome by a critical care expert. A Kaplan-Meier analysis to compare the 28-day mortality trends exhibited significant differences (p < 0.005) between the four phenotypes. The study demonstrates the utility of our deep representation learning-based approach in unraveling phenotypes that reflect the heterogeneity in sepsis-induced ARF in terms of different mortality outcomes and severity. These phenotypes might reveal important clinical insights into an effective prognosis and tailored treatment strategies.</p></details> | 9 pages |

| **[CGD: Constraint-Guided Diffusion Policies for UAV Trajectory Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01758v1)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional optimization-based planners, while effective, suffer from high computational costs, resulting in slow trajectory generation. A successful strategy to reduce computation time involves using Imitation Learning (IL) to develop fast neural network (NN) policies from those planners, which are treated as expert demonstrators. Although the resulting NN policies are effective at quickly generating trajectories similar to those from the expert, (1) their output does not explicitly account for dynamic feasibility, and (2) the policies do not accommodate changes in the constraints different from those used during training. To overcome these limitations, we propose Constraint-Guided Diffusion (CGD), a novel IL-based approach to trajectory planning. CGD leverages a hybrid learning/online optimization scheme that combines diffusion policies with a surrogate efficient optimization problem, enabling the generation of collision-free, dynamically feasible trajectories. The key ideas of CGD include dividing the original challenging optimization problem solved by the expert into two more manageable sub-problems: (a) efficiently finding collision-free paths, and (b) determining a dynamically-feasible time-parametrization for those paths to obtain a trajectory. Compared to conventional neural network architectures, we demonstrate through numerical evaluations significant improvements in performance and dynamic feasibility under scenarios with new constraints never encountered during training.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

In this regard, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data plays a significant role by offering real-time streaming data on vessel movement, allowing enhanced traffic monitoring. This study explores using AIS data to prevent vessel-to-whale collisions by forecasting long-term vessel trajectories from engineered AIS data sequences. For such a task, we have developed an encoder-decoder model architecture using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (Bi-LSTM) to predict the next 12 hours of vessel trajectories using 1 to 3 hours of AIS data as input. We feed the model with probabilistic features engineered from historical AIS data that refer to each trajectory's potential route and destination. The model then predicts the vessel's trajectory, considering these additional features by leveraging convolutional layers for spatial feature learning and a position-aware attention mechanism that increases the importance of recent timesteps of a sequence during temporal feature learning. The probabilistic features have an F1 Score of approximately 85% and 75% for each feature type, respectively, demonstrating their effectiveness in augmenting information to the neural network. We test our model on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, a region known to be the habitat of North Atlantic Right Whales (NARW). Our model achieved a high R2 score of over 98% using various techniques and features. It stands out among other approaches as it can make complex decisions during turnings and path selection. Our study highlights the potential of data engineering and trajectory forecasting models for marine life species preservation.</p></details> |  |

Though the problem is rather ancient, apart from the fact that the previous approaches have never considered user- and time-specific QoS, we point out a prevalent mistake in coordinate optimization approaches adopted by the majority of the literature. Coordinate optimization approaches, which repetitively optimize radio resources for a fixed trajectory and vice versa, generally converge to local optima when all variables are differentiable. However, these methods often stagnate at a non-stationary point, significantly degrading the network utility in mixed-integer problems such as joint trajectory and radio resource optimization. We detour this problem by converting the formulated problem into the Markov decision process (MDP). Exploiting the beneficial characteristics of the MDP, we design a non-iterative framework that cooperatively optimizes trajectory and radio resources without initial trajectory choice. The proposed framework can incorporate various trajectory planning algorithms such as the genetic algorithm, tree search, and reinforcement learning. Extensive comparisons with diverse baselines verify that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method, nearly achieving the global optimum.

The fundamental goal of MLR is to learn the regression models from unlabeled observations. The EM algorithm finds extensive applications in solving the mixture of linear regressions. Recent results have established the super-linear convergence of EM for 2MLR in the noiseless and high SNR settings under some assumptions and its global convergence rate with random initialization has been affirmed. However, the exponent of convergence has not been theoretically estimated and the geometric properties of the trajectory of EM iterations are not well-understood. In this paper, first, using Bessel functions we provide explicit closed-form expressions for the EM updates under all SNR regimes. Then, in the noiseless setting, we completely characterize the behavior of EM iterations by deriving a recurrence relation at the population level and notably show that all the iterations lie on a certain cycloid. Based on this new trajectory-based analysis, we exhibit the theoretical estimate for the exponent of super-linear convergence and further improve the statistical error bound at the finite-sample level. Our analysis provides a new framework for studying the behavior of EM for Mixed Linear Regression.</p></details> |  |

Data augmentation techniques, such as noise injection and data synthesizing, aim to improve Q-function approximation by smoothing the learned state-action region. However, these methods often fall short of directly improving the quality of offline datasets, leading to suboptimal results. In response, we introduce \textbf{GTA}, Generative Trajectory Augmentation, a novel generative data augmentation approach designed to enrich offline data by augmenting trajectories to be both high-rewarding and dynamically plausible. GTA applies a diffusion model within the data augmentation framework. GTA partially noises original trajectories and then denoises them with classifier-free guidance via conditioning on amplified return value. Our results show that GTA, as a general data augmentation strategy, enhances the performance of widely used offline RL algorithms in both dense and sparse reward settings. Furthermore, we conduct a quality analysis of data augmented by GTA and demonstrate that GTA improves the quality of the data.

| **[Resisting Stochastic Risks in Diffusion Planners with the Trajectory Aggregation Tree](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17879v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion planners have shown promise in handling long-horizon and sparse-reward tasks due to the non-autoregressive plan generation. However, their inherent stochastic risk of generating infeasible trajectories presents significant challenges to their reliability and stability. We introduce a novel approach, the Trajectory Aggregation Tree (TAT), to address this issue in diffusion planners. Compared to prior methods that rely solely on raw trajectory predictions, TAT aggregates information from both historical and current trajectories, forming a dynamic tree-like structure. Each trajectory is conceptualized as a branch and individual states as nodes. As the structure evolves with the integration of new trajectories, unreliable states are marginalized, and the most impactful nodes are prioritized for decision-making. TAT can be deployed without modifying the original training and sampling pipelines of diffusion planners, making it a training-free, ready-to-deploy solution. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to support TAT's effectiveness. Our results highlight its remarkable ability to resist the risk from unreliable trajectories, guarantee the performance boosting of diffusion planners in $100\%$ of tasks, and exhibit an appreciable tolerance margin for sample quality, thereby enabling planning with a more than $3\times$ acceleration.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 4...</summary><p>The 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis reduces sample size requirements and expedites time-to-efficacy signals in advanced cancer clinical trials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02529v3)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis is limited to single unidirectional endpoints, most advanced cancer randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are powered for either progression free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS). This discards efficacy information carried by partial responses, complete responses, and stable disease that frequently precede progressive disease and death. Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis (CWTA) is a generalization of KM that simultaneously assesses multiple rank-ordered endpoints. We hypothesized that CWTA could use this efficacy information to reduce sample size requirements and expedite efficacy signals in advanced cancer trials. We performed 100-fold and 1000-fold simulations of solid tumour systemic therapy RCTs with health statuses rank ordered from complete response (Stage 0) to death (Stage 4). At increments of sample size and hazard ratio, we compared KM PFS and OS with CWTA for (i) sample size requirements to achieve a power of 0.8 and (ii) time-to-first significant efficacy signal. CWTA consistently demonstrated greater power, and reduced sample size requirements by 18% to 35% compared to KM PFS and 14% to 20% compared to KM OS. CWTA also expedited time-to-efficacy signals 2- to 6-fold. CWTA, by incorporating all efficacy signals in the cancer treatment trajectory, provides clinically relevant reduction in required sample size and meaningfully expedites the efficacy signals of cancer treatments compared to KM PFS and KM OS. Using CWTA rather than KM as the primary trial outcome has the potential to meaningfully reduce the numbers of patients, trial duration, and costs to evaluate therapies in advanced cancer.</p></details> |  |

Many studies used to estimate ITRs are longitudinal in nature, collecting outcomes over time. Yet, to date, methods developed to estimate ITRs often ignore the longitudinal structure of the data. Information available from the longitudinal nature of the data can be especially useful in mental health studies. Although treatment means might appear similar, understanding the trajectory of outcomes over time can reveal important differences between treatments and placebo effects. This longitudinal perspective is especially beneficial in mental health research, where subtle shifts in outcome patterns can hold significant implications. Despite numerous studies involving the collection of outcome data across various time points, most precision medicine methods used to develop ITRs overlook the information available from the longitudinal structure. The prevalence of missing data in such studies exacerbates the issue, as neglecting the longitudinal nature of the data can significantly impair the effectiveness of treatment rules. This paper develops a powerful longitudinal trajectory-based ITR construction method that incorporates baseline variables, via a single-index or biosignature, into the modeling of longitudinal outcomes. This trajectory-based ITR approach substantially minimizes the negative impact of missing data compared to more traditional ITR approaches. The approach is illustrated through simulation studies and a clinical trial for depression, contrasting it with more traditional ITRs that ignore longitudinal information.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deciphering Movement: Unified Trajectory Generation Model for Multi-Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17680v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding multi-agent behavior is critical across various fields. The conventional approach involves analyzing agent movements through three primary tasks: trajectory prediction, imputation, and spatial-temporal recovery. Considering the unique input formulation and constraint of these tasks, most existing methods are tailored to address only one specific task. However, in real-world applications, these scenarios frequently occur simultaneously. Consequently, methods designed for one task often fail to adapt to others, resulting in performance drops. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Unified Trajectory Generation model, UniTraj, that processes arbitrary trajectories as masked inputs, adaptable to diverse scenarios. Specifically, we introduce a Ghost Spatial Masking (GSM) module embedded within a Transformer encoder for spatial feature extraction. We further extend recent successful State Space Models (SSMs), particularly the Mamba model, into a Bidirectional Temporal Mamba to effectively capture temporal dependencies. Additionally, we incorporate a Bidirectional Temporal Scaled (BTS) module to comprehensively scan trajectories while maintaining the temporal missing relationships within the sequence. We curate and benchmark three practical sports game datasets, Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U, for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses this unified problem through a versatile generative framework, thereby enhancing our understanding of multi-agent movement. Our datasets, code, and model weights are available at https://github.com/colorfulfuture/UniTraj-pytorch.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Datasets, code, and model weights at available at: https://github.com/colorfulfuture/UniTraj-pytorch</p></details> |

However, calibrating stereo vision systems that incorporate both event and frame-based cameras remains a significant challenge. In this letter, we present EF-Calib, a spatiotemporal calibration framework for event- and frame-based cameras using continuous-time trajectories. A novel calibration pattern applicable to both camera types and the corresponding event recognition algorithm is proposed. Leveraging the asynchronous nature of events, a derivable piece-wise B-spline to represent camera pose continuously is introduced, enabling calibration for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset, with analytical Jacobians provided. Various experiments are carried out to evaluate the calibration performance of EF-Calib, including calibration experiments for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset. Experimental results show that EF-Calib achieves the most accurate intrinsic parameters compared to current SOTA, the close accuracy of the extrinsic parameters compared to the frame-based results, and accurate time offset estimation. EF-Calib provides a convenient and accurate toolbox for calibrating the system that fuses events and frames. The code of this paper will also be open-sourced at: https://github.com/wsakobe/EF-Calib.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

Despite increased attention to this issue, most approaches in trajectory prediction do not consider all of these factors sufficiently. We present SemanticFormer, an approach for predicting multimodal trajectories by reasoning over a semantic traffic scene graph using a hybrid approach. It utilizes high-level information in the form of meta-paths, i.e. trajectories on which an agent is allowed to drive from a knowledge graph which is then processed by a novel pipeline based on multiple attention mechanisms to predict accurate trajectories. SemanticFormer comprises a hierarchical heterogeneous graph encoder to capture spatio-temporal and relational information across agents as well as between agents and road elements. Further, it includes a predictor to fuse different encodings and decode trajectories with probabilities. Finally, a refinement module assesses permitted meta-paths of trajectories and speed profiles to obtain final predicted trajectories. Evaluation of the nuScenes benchmark demonstrates improved performance compared to several SOTA methods. In addition, we demonstrate that our knowledge graph can be easily added to two graph-based existing SOTA methods, namely VectorNet and Laformer, replacing their original homogeneous graphs. The evaluation results suggest that by adding our knowledge graph the performance of the original methods is enhanced by 5% and 4%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted to RA-L</p></details> |

This pattern is also often observed within-seasons as athlete aims for their performance to peak at key events such as the Olympic Games or World Championships. A Bayesian hierarchical model is developed to analyse the evolution of athletic sporting performance throughout an athlete's career and separate these effects whilst allowing for confounding factors such as environmental conditions. Our model works in continuous time and estimates both the average performance level of the population, $g(t)$, at age $t$ and how each $i$-th athlete differs from the average $f_i(t)$. We further decompose $f_i(t)$ into changes from season-to-season, termed the between-season performance trajectory, and within-season performance trajectories which are modelled by a constrained Bernstein polynomial. Hence, the specific focus of this project is to identify the differences in performance that exist both between and within-seasons for each athlete. For the implementation of the model an adaptive Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm is used. An illustration of algorithm's performance on 100 metres and 200 metres freestyle swimming in both female and male athletes is presented.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Data Suffices for Statistically Efficient Learning in Offline RL with Linear $q^π$-Realizability and Concentrability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16809v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider offline reinforcement learning (RL) in $H$-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) under the linear $q^\pi$-realizability assumption, where the action-value function of every policy is linear with respect to a given $d$-dimensional feature function. The hope in this setting is that learning a good policy will be possible without requiring a sample size that scales with the number of states in the MDP. Foster et al. [2021] have shown this to be impossible even under $\textit{concentrability}$, a data coverage assumption where a coefficient $C_\text{conc}$ bounds the extent to which the state-action distribution of any policy can veer off the data distribution. However, the data in this previous work was in the form of a sequence of individual transitions. This leaves open the question of whether the negative result mentioned could be overcome if the data was composed of sequences of full trajectories. In this work we answer this question positively by proving that with trajectory data, a dataset of size $\text{poly}(d,H,C_\text{conc})/\epsilon^2$ is sufficient for deriving an $\epsilon$-optimal policy, regardless of the size of the state space. The main tool that makes this result possible is due to Weisz et al. [2023], who demonstrate that linear MDPs can be used to approximate linearly $q^\pi$-realizable MDPs. The connection to trajectory data is that the linear MDP approximation relies on "skipping" over certain states. The associated estimation problems are thus easy when working with trajectory data, while they remain nontrivial when working with individual transitions. The question of computational efficiency under our assumptions remains open.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combining Constrained Diffusion Models and Numerical Solvers for Efficient and Robust Non-Convex Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05571v3)** | 2024-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the need to solve open-loop optimal control problems with computational efficiency and reliable constraint satisfaction, we introduce a general framework that combines diffusion models and numerical optimization solvers. Optimal control problems are rarely solvable in closed form, hence they are often transcribed into numerical trajectory optimization problems, which then require initial guesses. These initial guesses are supplied in our framework by diffusion models. To mitigate the effect of samples that violate the problem constraints, we develop a novel constrained diffusion model to approximate the true distribution of locally optimal solutions with an additional constraint violation loss in training. To further enhance the robustness, the diffusion samples as initial guesses are fed to the numerical solver to refine and derive final optimal (and hence feasible) solutions. Experimental evaluations on three tasks verify the improved constraint satisfaction and computational efficiency with 4$\times$ to 30$\times$ acceleration using our proposed framework, which generalizes across trajectory optimization problems and scales well with problem complexity.</p></details> |  |

We utilize OpenCV's CSRT algorithm to accurately track the baseball and fixed reference points in 2D video frames. These tracked pixel coordinates are then used as input features for our neural network model, which comprises multiple fully connected layers to map the 2D coordinates to 3D space. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled trajectories using a mean squared error loss function and the Adam optimizer, optimizing the network to minimize prediction errors. Our experimental results demonstrate that this approach achieves high accuracy in reconstructing 3D trajectories from 2D inputs. This method shows great potential for applications in sports analysis, coaching, and enhancing the accuracy of trajectory predictions in various sports.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlightPatchNet: Multi-Scale Patch Network with Differential Coding for Flight Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16200v1)** | 2024-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate multi-step flight trajectory prediction plays an important role in Air Traffic Control, which can ensure the safety of air transportation. Two main issues limit the flight trajectory prediction performance of existing works. The first issue is the negative impact on prediction accuracy caused by the significant differences in data range. The second issue is that real-world flight trajectories involve underlying temporal dependencies, and existing methods fail to reveal the hidden complex temporal variations and only extract features from one single time scale. To address the above issues, we propose FlightPatchNet, a multi-scale patch network with differential coding for flight trajectory prediction. Specifically, FlightPatchNet first utilizes the differential coding to encode the original values of longitude and latitude into first-order differences and generates embeddings for all variables at each time step. Then, a global temporal attention is introduced to explore the dependencies between different time steps. To fully explore the diverse temporal patterns in flight trajectories, a multi-scale patch network is delicately designed to serve as the backbone. The multi-scale patch network exploits stacked patch mixer blocks to capture inter- and intra-patch dependencies under different time scales, and further integrates multi-scale temporal features across different scales and variables. Finally, FlightPatchNet ensembles multiple predictors to make direct multi-step prediction. Extensive experiments on ADS-B datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the competitive baselines.

| **[Optimal Flow Matching: Learning Straight Trajectories in Just One Step](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13117v2)** | 2024-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the several recent years, there has been a boom in development of Flow Matching (FM) methods for generative modeling. One intriguing property pursued by the community is the ability to learn flows with straight trajectories which realize the Optimal Transport (OT) displacements. Straightness is crucial for the fast integration (inference) of the learned flow's paths. Unfortunately, most existing flow straightening methods are based on non-trivial iterative FM procedures which accumulate the error during training or exploit heuristics based on minibatch OT. To address these issues, we develop and theoretically justify the novel Optimal Flow Matching approach which allows recovering the straight OT displacement for the quadratic transport in just one FM step. The main idea of our approach is the employment of vector field for FM which are parameterized by convex functions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Delving into the Trajectory Long-tail Distribution for Muti-object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04700v2)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) is a critical area within computer vision, with a broad spectrum of practical implementations. Current research has primarily focused on the development of tracking algorithms and enhancement of post-processing techniques. Yet, there has been a lack of thorough examination concerning the nature of tracking data it self. In this study, we pioneer an exploration into the distribution patterns of tracking data and identify a pronounced long-tail distribution issue within existing MOT datasets. We note a significant imbalance in the distribution of trajectory lengths across different pedestrians, a phenomenon we refer to as ``pedestrians trajectory long-tail distribution''. Addressing this challenge, we introduce a bespoke strategy designed to mitigate the effects of this skewed distribution. Specifically, we propose two data augmentation strategies, including Stationary Camera View Data Augmentation (SVA) and Dynamic Camera View Data Augmentation (DVA) , designed for viewpoint states and the Group Softmax (GS) module for Re-ID. SVA is to backtrack and predict the pedestrian trajectory of tail classes, and DVA is to use diffusion model to change the background of the scene. GS divides the pedestrians into unrelated groups and performs softmax operation on each group individually. Our proposed strategies can be integrated into numerous existing tracking systems, and extensive experimentation validates the efficacy of our method in reducing the influence of long-tail distribution on multi-object tracking performance.

However, previous methods focus on individual traffic participant trajectory generation, thus failing to account for the complexity of interactive traffic dynamics. In this work, we propose InteractTraj, the first language-driven traffic trajectory generator that can generate interactive traffic trajectories. InteractTraj interprets abstract trajectory descriptions into concrete formatted interaction-aware numerical codes and learns a mapping between these formatted codes and the final interactive trajectories. To interpret language descriptions, we propose a language-to-code encoder with a novel interaction-aware encoding strategy. To produce interactive traffic trajectories, we propose a code-to-trajectory decoder with interaction-aware feature aggregation that synergizes vehicle interactions with the environmental map and the vehicle moves. Extensive experiments show our method demonstrates superior performance over previous SoTA methods, offering a more realistic generation of interactive traffic trajectories with high controllability via diverse natural language commands.

However, in multi-objective hyperparameter optimization scenarios, the insights gained from the iterative learning procedure typically remain underutilized. We notice that tracking the model performance across multiple epochs under a hyperparameter setting creates a trajectory in the objective space and that trade-offs along the trajectories are often overlooked despite their potential to offer valuable insights to decision-making for model retraining. Therefore, in this study, we propose to enhance the multi-objective hyperparameter optimization problem by having training epochs as an additional decision variable to incorporate trajectory information. Correspondingly, we present a novel trajectory-based multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithm characterized by two features: 1) an acquisition function that captures the improvement made by the predictive trajectory of any hyperparameter setting and 2) a multi-objective early stopping mechanism that determines when to terminate the trajectory to maximize epoch efficiency. Numerical experiments on diverse synthetic simulations and hyperparameter tuning benchmarks indicate that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-objective optimizers in both locating better trade-offs and tuning efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, it encounters two main challenges in multi-drone collaboration settings. The expansive aerial observations make it difficult to generate precise Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations. Besides, excessive interactions can not meet real-time prediction requirements within the constrained drone-based communication bandwidth. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework named "Drones Help Drones" (DHD). Firstly, we incorporate the ground priors provided by the drone's inclined observation to estimate the distance between objects and drones, leading to more precise BEV generation. Secondly, we design a selective mechanism based on the local feature discrepancy to prioritize the critical information contributing to prediction tasks during inter-drone interactions. Additionally, we create the first dataset for multi-drone collaborative prediction, named "Air-Co-Pred", and conduct quantitative and qualitative experiments to validate the effectiveness of our DHD framework.The results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art approaches, DHD reduces position deviation in BEV representations by over 20% and requires only a quarter of the transmission ratio for interactions while achieving comparable prediction performance. Moreover, DHD also shows promising generalization to the collaborative 3D object detection in CoPerception-UAVs.</p></details> |  |

At the control center, offline motion planning is fundamental in the computation of optimized trajectories accounting for the system's constraints. Smooth movements, collision and forbidden areas avoidance, target visibility and energy consumption are all important factors to consider to be able to generate feasible and optimal plans. When mobile manipulators (terrestrial, aerial) are employed, the base and the arm movements are often separately planned, ultimately resulting in sub-optimal solutions. We propose an Optimal Whole Body Planner (OptiWB) based on Discrete Dynamic Programming (DDP) and optimal interpolation. Kinematic redundancy is exploited for collision and forbidden areas avoidance, and to improve target illumination and visibility from onboard cameras. The planner, implemented in ROS (Robot Operating System), interfaces 3DROCS, a mission planner used in several programs of the European Space Agency (ESA) to support planetary exploration surface missions and part of the ExoMars Rover's planning software. The proposed approach is exercised on a simplified version of the Analog-1 Interact rover by ESA, a 7-DOFs robotic arm mounted on a four wheels non-holonomic platform.</p></details> |  |

Detection methods in generative language models (GLMs) mainly focus on uncertainty estimation and embedding distance measurement, with the latter proven to be most effective in traditional linguistic tasks like summarization and translation. However, another complex generative scenario mathematical reasoning poses significant challenges to embedding-based methods due to its high-density feature of output spaces, but this feature causes larger discrepancies in the embedding shift trajectory between different samples in latent spaces. Hence, we propose a trajectory-based method TV score, which uses trajectory volatility for OOD detection in mathematical reasoning. Experiments show that our method outperforms all traditional algorithms on GLMs under mathematical reasoning scenarios and can be extended to more applications with high-density features in output spaces, such as multiple-choice questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 6 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

Current distillation techniques often dichotomize into two distinct aspects: i) ODE Trajectory Preservation; and ii) ODE Trajectory Reformulation. However, these approaches suffer from severe performance degradation or domain shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Hyper-SD, a novel framework that synergistically amalgamates the advantages of ODE Trajectory Preservation and Reformulation, while maintaining near-lossless performance during step compression. Firstly, we introduce Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation to progressively perform consistent distillation within pre-defined time-step segments, which facilitates the preservation of the original ODE trajectory from a higher-order perspective. Secondly, we incorporate human feedback learning to boost the performance of the model in a low-step regime and mitigate the performance loss incurred by the distillation process. Thirdly, we integrate score distillation to further improve the low-step generation capability of the model and offer the first attempt to leverage a unified LoRA to support the inference process at all steps. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that Hyper-SD achieves SOTA performance from 1 to 8 inference steps for both SDXL and SD1.5. For example, Hyper-SDXL surpasses SDXL-Lightning by +0.68 in CLIP Score and +0.51 in Aes Score in the 1-step inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://hyper-sd.github.io/</p></details> |

Many existing automatic methods focus on roughly controlling predefined shot types or movement patterns, which struggle to engage viewers with the circumstances of the actor. Real-world cinematographic rules show that directors can create immersion by comprehensively synchronizing the camera with the actor. Inspired by this strategy, we propose a deep camera control framework that enables actor-camera synchronization in three aspects, considering frame aesthetics, spatial action, and emotional status in the 3D virtual stage. Following rule-of-thirds, our framework first modifies the initial camera placement to position the actor aesthetically. This adjustment is facilitated by a self-supervised adjustor that analyzes frame composition via camera projection. We then design a GAN model that can adversarially synthesize fine-grained camera movement based on the physical action and psychological state of the actor, using an encoder-decoder generator to map kinematics and emotional variables into camera trajectories. Moreover, we incorporate a regularizer to align the generated stylistic variances with specific emotional categories and intensities. The experimental results show that our proposed method yields immersive cinematic videos of high quality, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Live examples can be found in the supplementary video.</p></details> |  |

These approaches commonly employ attention-based architecture or graph neural networks for encoding interactions, which introduces three challenges: (i) The indiscriminate selection of all nearby agents substantially escalates the computational demands of the model, particularly in those interaction-rich scenarios. (ii) Moreover, the simplistic feature extraction of current time agents falls short of adequately capturing the nuanced dynamics of interactions. (iii) Compounded by the inherently low interpretability of attention mechanism and graph neural networks, there is a propensity for the model to allocate unreliable correlation coefficients to certain agents, adversely impacting the accuracy of trajectory predictions. To mitigate these issues, we introduce ASPILin, a novel approach that enhances the selection of interacting agents by considering their current and future lanes, extending this consideration across all historical frames. Utilizing the states of the agents, we estimate the nearest future distance between agents and the time needed to reach this distance. Then, combine these with their current distances to derive a physical correlation coefficient to encode interactions. Experiments conducted on popular trajectory prediction datasets demonstrate that our method is efficient and straightforward, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code:https://github.com/kkk00714/ASPILin</p></details> |

Developing a versatile trajectory learning approach that can adapt to different tasks while ensuring high accuracy is crucial. This requires effectively extracting movement patterns and travel purposes embedded in trajectories. However, this task is challenging due to limitations in the size and quality of available trajectory datasets. On the other hand, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown great success in adapting to different tasks by training on large-scale, high-quality corpus datasets. Given the similarities between trajectories and sentences, there is potential in leveraging PLMs to enhance the development of a versatile and effective trajectory learning method. Nevertheless, vanilla PLMs are not tailored to handle the unique spatio-temporal features present in trajectories and lack the capability to extract movement patterns and travel purposes from them. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a model called PLM4Traj that effectively utilizes PLMs to model trajectories. PLM4Traj leverages the strengths of PLMs to create a versatile trajectory learning approach while addressing the limitations of vanilla PLMs in modeling trajectories. Firstly, PLM4Traj incorporates a novel trajectory semantic embedder that enables PLMs to process spatio-temporal features in trajectories and extract movement patterns and travel purposes from them. Secondly, PLM4Traj introduces a novel trajectory prompt that integrates movement patterns and travel purposes into PLMs, while also allowing the model to adapt to various tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets and two representative tasks demonstrate that PLM4Traj successfully achieves its design goals.

However, there are still open questions about the effects of perturbations on inputs other than state histories, and how these attacks impact downstream planning and control. In this paper, we conduct a sensitivity analysis on two trajectory prediction models, Trajectron++ and AgentFormer. The analysis reveals that between all inputs, almost all of the perturbation sensitivities for both models lie only within the most recent position and velocity states. We additionally demonstrate that, despite dominant sensitivity on state history perturbations, an undetectable image map perturbation made with the Fast Gradient Sign Method can induce large prediction error increases in both models, revealing that these trajectory predictors are, in fact, susceptible to image-based attacks. Using an optimization-based planner and example perturbations crafted from sensitivity results, we show how these attacks can cause a vehicle to come to a sudden stop from moderate driving speeds.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 1 tables</p></details> |

Dynamic obstacles may also be interactive, i.e., their behavior varies based on the behavior of other entities. We propose a novel representation for interactive behavior of dynamic obstacles and a decentralized real-time multi-robot trajectory planning algorithm allowing inter-robot collision avoidance as well as static and dynamic obstacle avoidance. Our planner simulates the behavior of dynamic obstacles, accounting for interactivity. We account for the perception inaccuracy of static and prediction inaccuracy of dynamic obstacles. We handle asynchronous planning between teammates and message delays, drops, and re-orderings. We evaluate our algorithm in simulations using 25400 random cases and compare it against three state-of-the-art baselines using 2100 random cases. Our algorithm achieves up to 1.68x success rate using as low as 0.28x time in single-robot, and up to 2.15x success rate using as low as 0.36x time in multi-robot cases compared to the best baseline.

| **[Is Mamba Compatible with Trajectory Optimization in Offline Reinforcement Learning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12094v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based trajectory optimization methods have demonstrated exceptional performance in offline Reinforcement Learning (offline RL), yet it poses challenges due to substantial parameter size and limited scalability, which is particularly critical in sequential decision-making scenarios where resources are constrained such as in robots and drones with limited computational power. Mamba, a promising new linear-time sequence model, offers performance on par with transformers while delivering substantially fewer parameters on long sequences. As it remains unclear whether Mamba is compatible with trajectory optimization, this work aims to conduct comprehensive experiments to explore the potential of Decision Mamba in offline RL (dubbed DeMa) from the aspect of data structures and network architectures with the following insights: (1) Long sequences impose a significant computational burden without contributing to performance improvements due to the fact that DeMa's focus on sequences diminishes approximately exponentially. Consequently, we introduce a Transformer-like DeMa as opposed to an RNN-like DeMa. (2) For the components of DeMa, we identify that the hidden attention mechanism is key to its success, which can also work well with other residual structures and does not require position embedding. Extensive evaluations from eight Atari games demonstrate that our specially designed DeMa is compatible with trajectory optimization and surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods, outdoing Decision Transformer (DT) by 80\% with 30\% fewer parameters, and exceeds DT in MuJoCo with only a quarter of the parameters.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

We propose methods for clustering trajectory-states and sampling strategies in an active learning framework, aiming to reduce annotation and data costs while maintaining model performance. Our approach leverages trajectory information to guide data selection, promoting diversity in the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on the trajectory prediction task using the nuScenes dataset, showing consistent performance gains over random sampling across different data pool sizes, and even reaching sub-baseline displacement errors at just 50% of the data cost. Our results suggest that sampling typical data initially helps overcome the ''cold start problem,'' while introducing novelty becomes more beneficial as the training pool size increases. By integrating trajectory-state-informed active learning, we demonstrate that more efficient and robust autonomous driving systems are possible and practical using low-cost data curation strategies.</p></details> |  |

Score-based Diffusion Models, a type of generative model that iteratively learns to denoise data, have shown state-of-the-art results on tasks such as image generation, multivariate time series forecasting, and robotic trajectory planning. Using score-based diffusion models, this work implements a novel generative framework to generate ballistic transfers from Earth to Mars. We further analyze the model's ability to learn the characteristics of the original dataset and its ability to produce transfers that follow the underlying dynamics. Ablation studies were conducted to determine how model performance varies with model size and trajectory temporal resolution. In addition, a performance benchmark is designed to assess the generative model's usefulness for trajectory design, conduct model performance comparisons, and lay the groundwork for evaluating different generative models for trajectory design beyond diffusion. The results of this analysis showcase several useful properties of diffusion models that, when taken together, can enable a future system for generative trajectory design powered by diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at the 2024 Astrodynamics Specialist Conference</p></details> |

The two main challenges addressed include accurately predicting the paths of UAVs and efficiently avoiding collisions between them. Firstly, the paper systematically applies a diverse set of activation functions to a Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) with a single hidden layer, which enhances the accuracy of the predicted path compared to previous work. Secondly, we introduce a novel activation function, AdaptoSwelliGauss, which is a sophisticated fusion of Swish and Elliott activations, seamlessly integrated with a scaled and shifted Gaussian component. Swish facilitates smooth transitions, Elliott captures abrupt trajectory changes, and the scaled and shifted Gaussian enhances robustness against noise. This dynamic combination is specifically designed to excel in capturing the complexities of UAV trajectory prediction. This new activation function gives substantially better accuracy than all existing activation functions. Thirdly, we propose a novel Integrated Collision Detection, Avoidance, and Batching (ICDAB) strategy that merges two complementary UAV collision avoidance techniques: changing UAV trajectories and altering their starting times, also referred to as batching. This integration helps overcome the disadvantages of both - reduction in the number of trajectory manipulations, which avoids overly convoluted paths in the first technique, and smaller batch sizes, which reduce overall takeoff time in the second.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 Pa...</summary><p>24 Pages, 9 Tables, 6 Figures</p></details> |
| **[Semantic Trajectory Data Mining with LLM-Informed POI Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11715v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human travel trajectory mining is crucial for transportation systems, enhancing route optimization, traffic management, and the study of human travel patterns. Previous rule-based approaches without the integration of semantic information show a limitation in both efficiency and accuracy. Semantic information, such as activity types inferred from Points of Interest (POI) data, can significantly enhance the quality of trajectory mining. However, integrating these insights is challenging, as many POIs have incomplete feature information, and current learning-based POI algorithms require the integrity of datasets to do the classification. In this paper, we introduce a novel pipeline for human travel trajectory mining. Our approach first leverages the strong inferential and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to annotate POI with activity types and then uses a Bayesian-based algorithm to infer activity for each stay point in a trajectory. In our evaluation using the OpenStreetMap (OSM) POI dataset, our approach achieves a 93.4% accuracy and a 96.1% F-1 score in POI classification, and a 91.7% accuracy with a 92.3% F-1 score in activity inference.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric approach to investigate how clusters of these functional relations evolve over time. Our model clusters individual functional trajectories within and across time periods while flexibly accommodating the evolution of the partitions across time periods with covariates. Motivated by mobile health data collected in a novel, smartphone-based smoking cessation intervention study, we demonstrate how our proposed method can simultaneously cluster functional trajectories, accommodate temporal dependence, and provide insights into the transitions between functional clusters over time.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Trajectory Regularity of ODE-based Diffusion Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11326v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models use stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and their equivalent ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to establish a smooth connection between a complex data distribution and a tractable prior distribution. In this paper, we identify several intriguing trajectory properties in the ODE-based sampling process of diffusion models. We characterize an implicit denoising trajectory and discuss its vital role in forming the coupled sampling trajectory with a strong shape regularity, regardless of the generated content. We also describe a dynamic programming-based scheme to make the time schedule in sampling better fit the underlying trajectory structure. This simple strategy requires minimal modification to any given ODE-based numerical solvers and incurs negligible computational cost, while delivering superior performance in image generation, especially in $5\sim 10$ function evaluations.</p></details> | ICML 2024, 30 pages |
| **[Dreamer XL: Towards High-Resolution Text-to-3D Generation via Trajectory Score Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11252v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a novel Trajectory Score Matching (TSM) method that aims to solve the pseudo ground truth inconsistency problem caused by the accumulated error in Interval Score Matching (ISM) when using the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion process. Unlike ISM which adopts the inversion process of DDIM to calculate on a single path, our TSM method leverages the inversion process of DDIM to generate two paths from the same starting point for calculation. Since both paths start from the same starting point, TSM can reduce the accumulated error compared to ISM, thus alleviating the problem of pseudo ground truth inconsistency. TSM enhances the stability and consistency of the model's generated paths during the distillation process. We demonstrate this experimentally and further show that ISM is a special case of TSM. Furthermore, to optimize the current multi-stage optimization process from high-resolution text to 3D generation, we adopt Stable Diffusion XL for guidance. In response to the issues of abnormal replication and splitting caused by unstable gradients during the 3D Gaussian splatting process when using Stable Diffusion XL, we propose a pixel-by-pixel gradient clipping method. Extensive experiments show that our model significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art models in terms of visual quality and performance.

| **[RuleFuser: Injecting Rules in Evidential Networks for Robust Out-of-Distribution Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11139v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern neural trajectory predictors in autonomous driving are developed using imitation learning (IL) from driving logs. Although IL benefits from its ability to glean nuanced and multi-modal human driving behaviors from large datasets, the resulting predictors often struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and with traffic rule compliance. On the other hand, classical rule-based predictors, by design, can predict traffic rule satisfying behaviors while being robust to OOD scenarios, but these predictors fail to capture nuances in agent-to-agent interactions and human driver's intent. In this paper, we present RuleFuser, a posterior-net inspired evidential framework that combines neural predictors with classical rule-based predictors to draw on the complementary benefits of both, thereby striking a balance between performance and traffic rule compliance. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated on the real-world nuPlan dataset where RuleFuser leverages the higher performance of the neural predictor in in-distribution (ID) scenarios and the higher safety offered by the rule-based predictor in OOD scenarios.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

This report investigates the potential of deploying a fully actuated Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) for shallow area exploration beneath ice sheets. Leveraging advancements in marine robotics technology, ROVs offer a promising solution for extending human presence into remote underwater locations. To enable successful under-ice exploration, the ROV must follow precise trajectories for effective localization signal reception. This study develops a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear system controller, incorporating a Lyapunov-based stability guarantee and an adaptation law to mitigate unknown environmental disturbances. Fuzzy logic is employed to dynamically adjust adaptation rates, enhancing performance in highly nonlinear ROV dynamic systems. Additionally, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm automates the tuning of controller parameters for optimal trajectory tracking. The report details the ROV dynamic model, the proposed control framework, and the PSO-based tuning process. Simulation-based experiments validate the efficacy of the methodology, with experimental results demonstrating superior trajectory tracking performance compared to baseline controllers. This work contributes to the advancement of under-ice exploration capabilities and sets the stage for future research in marine robotics and autonomous underwater systems.</p></details> |  |

Despite this recent upsurge, this area is still rarely systematically studied. In this paper, we provide an extensive survey, investigating CRL methods based on both interactive reinforcement learning algorithms and human-AI collaborative frameworks that were proposed in the past decade. We elucidate and discuss via synergistic analysis methods both the growth of the field and the state-of-the-art; we conceptualise the existing frameworks from the perspectives of design patterns, collaborative levels, parties and capabilities, and review interactive methods and algorithmic models. Specifically, we create a new Human-AI CRL Design Trajectory Map, as a systematic modelling tool for the selection of existing CRL frameworks, as well as a method of designing new CRL systems, and finally of improving future CRL designs. Furthermore, we elaborate generic Human-AI CRL challenges, providing the research community with a guide towards novel research directions. The aim of this paper is to empower researchers with a systematic framework for the design of efficient and 'natural' human-AI collaborative methods, making it possible to work on maximised realisation of humans' and AI's potentials.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods rely on the use of LSTM, GRU networks, and even Transformer architectures for the prediction of spatio-temporal series. This study proposes a viable alternative for predicting these trajectories using only GNSS positions. It considers this spatio-temporal problem as a natural language processing problem. The latitude/longitude coordinates of AIS messages are transformed into cell identifiers using the H3 index. Thanks to the pseudo-octal representation, it becomes easier for language models to learn the spatial hierarchy of the H3 index. The method is compared with a classical Kalman filter, widely used in the maritime domain, and introduces the Fr\'echet distance as the main evaluation metric. We show that it is possible to predict ship trajectories quite precisely up to 8 hours with 30 minutes of context. We demonstrate that this alternative works well enough to predict trajectories worldwide.</p></details> | 22 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Application of Gated Recurrent Units for CT Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09333v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in computed tomography (CT) imaging, especially with dual-robot systems, have introduced new challenges for scan trajectory optimization. This paper presents a novel approach using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to optimize CT scan trajectories. Our approach exploits the flexibility of robotic CT systems to select projections that enhance image quality by improving resolution and contrast while reducing scan time. We focus on cone-beam CT and employ several projection-based metrics, including absorption, pixel intensities, contrast-to-noise ratio, and data completeness. The GRU network aims to minimize data redundancy and maximize completeness with a limited number of projections. We validate our method using simulated data of a test specimen, focusing on a specific voxel of interest. The results show that the GRU-optimized scan trajectories can outperform traditional circular CT trajectories in terms of image quality metrics. For the used specimen, SSIM improves from 0.38 to 0.49 and CNR increases from 6.97 to 9.08. This finding suggests that the application of GRU in CT scan trajectory optimization can lead to more efficient, cost-effective, and high-quality imaging solutions.</p></details> | 4 pages, 6 figures |

To the best of our knowledge, this work presents first time a novel combination of handwritten trajectories features as chain codes and graph neural networks together. The handwritten trajectories for offline handwritten text has been evaluated using recovery of drawing order, whereas online handwritten trajectories are directly used with chain codes. Our results prove that present combination surpass previous results and minimize error rate in few epochs only.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOMTP: Self-Supervised Learning-Based Optimizer for MPC-Based Safe Trajectory Planning Problems in Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09212v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based trajectory planning has been widely used in robotics, and incorporating Control Barrier Function (CBF) constraints into MPC can greatly improve its obstacle avoidance efficiency. Unfortunately, traditional optimizers are resource-consuming and slow to solve such non-convex constrained optimization problems (COPs) while learning-based methods struggle to satisfy the non-convex constraints. In this paper, we propose SOMTP algorithm, a self-supervised learning-based optimizer for CBF-MPC trajectory planning. Specifically, first, SOMTP employs problem transcription to satisfy most of the constraints. Then the differentiable SLPG correction is proposed to move the solution closer to the safe set and is then converted as the guide policy in the following training process. After that, inspired by the Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM), our training algorithm integrated with guide policy constraints is proposed to enable the optimizer network to converge to a feasible solution. Finally, experiments show that the proposed algorithm has better feasibility than other learning-based methods and can provide solutions much faster than traditional optimizers with similar optimality.</p></details> |  |

This solution is both principled, providing precise finite-sample guarantees, and effective, often leading to more informative predictions than prior methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dim Small Target Detection and Tracking: A Novel Method Based on Temporal Energy Selective Scaling and Trajectory Association](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09054v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The detection and tracking of small targets in passive optical remote sensing (PORS) has broad applications. However, most of the previously proposed methods seldom utilize the abundant temporal features formed by target motion, resulting in poor detection and tracking performance for low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) targets. In this article, we analyze the difficulty based on spatial features and the feasibility based on temporal features of realizing effective detection. According to this analysis, we use a multi-frame as a detection unit and propose a detection method based on temporal energy selective scaling (TESS). Specifically, we investigated the composition of intensity temporal profiles (ITPs) formed by pixels on a multi-frame detection unit. For the target-present pixel, the target passing through the pixel will bring a weak transient disturbance on the ITP and introduce a change in the statistical properties of ITP. We use a well-designed function to amplify the transient disturbance, suppress the background and noise components, and output the trajectory of the target on the multi-frame detection unit. Subsequently, to solve the contradiction between the detection rate and the false alarm rate brought by the traditional threshold segmentation, we associate the temporal and spatial features of the output trajectory and propose a trajectory extraction method based on the 3D Hough transform. Finally, we model the trajectory of the target and propose a trajectory-based multi-target tracking method. Compared with the various state-of-the-art detection and tracking methods, experiments in multiple scenarios prove the superiority of our proposed methods.</p></details> |  |

To address this constraint, we propose a derivative-based lifting function construction method, show that the corresponding infinite dimensional Koopman bilinear model over the lifting function is equivalent to the original control-affine system. Further, we analyze the propagation and bounds of state prediction errors caused by the truncation in derivative order. The identified finite dimensional Koopman bilinear model would serve as predictive model in the next step. Koopman Bilinear Model Predictive control (K-BMPC) is proposed to solve the trajectory tracking problem. We linearize the bilinear model around the estimation of the lifted state and control input. Then the bilinear Model Predictive Control problem is approximated by a quadratic programming problem. Further, the estimation is updated at each iteration until the convergence is reached. Moreover, we implement our algorithm on a tractor-trailer system, taking into account the longitudinal and side slip effects. The open-loop simulation shows the proposed Koopman bilinear model captures the dynamics with unknown parameters and has good prediction performance. Closed-loop tracking results show the proposed K-BMPC exhibits elevated tracking precision with the commendable computational efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of K-BMPC.</p></details> |  |

Human behavior typically follows a pattern of normalcy in day-to-day activities. This is marked by recurring activities within specific time periods. In this paper, we model this behavior using Reeb graphs where any deviation from usual day-to-day activities is encoded as nodes in the Reeb graph. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear with respect to the number of time points in a given trajectory. We demonstrate the usage of ReeSPOT and how it captures the critically significant spatial and temporal deviations using the nodes of the Reeb graph. Our case study presented in this paper includes realistic human movement scenarios: visiting uncommon locations, taking odd routes at infrequent times, uncommon time visits, and uncommon stay durations. We analyze the Reeb graph to interpret the topological structure of the GPS trajectories. Potential applications of ReeSPOT include urban planning, security surveillance, and behavioral research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Plan Maneuverable and Agile Flight Trajectory with Optimization Embedded Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07736v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent times, an increasing number of researchers have been devoted to utilizing deep neural networks for end-to-end flight navigation. This approach has gained traction due to its ability to bridge the gap between perception and planning that exists in traditional methods, thereby eliminating delays between modules. However, the practice of replacing original modules with neural networks in a black-box manner diminishes the overall system's robustness and stability. It lacks principled explanations and often fails to consistently generate high-quality motion trajectories. Furthermore, such methods often struggle to rigorously account for the robot's kinematic constraints, resulting in the generation of trajectories that cannot be executed satisfactorily. In this work, we combine the advantages of traditional methods and neural networks by proposing an optimization-embedded neural network. This network can learn high-quality trajectories directly from visual inputs without the need of mapping, while ensuring dynamic feasibility. Here, the deep neural network is employed to directly extract environment safety regions from depth images. Subsequently, we employ a model-based approach to represent these regions as safety constraints in trajectory optimization. Leveraging the availability of highly efficient optimization algorithms, our method robustly converges to feasible and optimal solutions that satisfy various user-defined constraints. Moreover, we differentiate the optimization process, allowing it to be trained as a layer within the neural network. This approach facilitates the direct interaction between perception and planning, enabling the network to focus more on the spatial regions where optimal solutions exist. As a result, it further enhances the quality and stability of the generated trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/e2e_opt</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Similarity Measurement: An Efficiency Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00960v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectories that capture object movement have numerous applications, in which similarity computation between trajectories often plays a key role. Traditionally, the similarity between two trajectories is quantified by means of heuristic measures, e.g., Hausdorff or ERP, that operate directly on the trajectories. In contrast, recent studies exploit deep learning to map trajectories to d-dimensional vectors, called embeddings. Then, some distance measure, e.g., Manhattan or Euclidean, is applied to the embeddings to quantify trajectory similarity. The resulting similarities are inaccurate: they only approximate the similarities obtained using the heuristic measures. As distance computation on embeddings is efficient, focus has been on achieving embeddings yielding high accuracy. Adopting an efficiency perspective, we analyze the time complexities of both the heuristic and the learning-based approaches, finding that the time complexities of the former approaches are not necessarily higher. Through extensive experiments on open datasets, we find that, on both CPUs and GPUs, only a few learning-based approaches can deliver the promised higher efficiency, when the embeddings can be pre-computed, while heuristic approaches are more efficient for one-off computations. Among the learning-based approaches, the self-attention-based ones are the fastest to learn embeddings that also yield the highest accuracy for similarity queries. These results have implications for the use of trajectory similarity approaches given different application requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VLDB 2024</p></details> |

However,due to the high speed and even hypersonic capabilities of advanced fighters, the diversity of tactical maneuvers,and the instantaneous nature of situational transitions,it is difficult to meet the requirements of practical combat applications in terms of prediction accuracy.To improve prediction accuracy,this paper proposes a spatio-temporal graph attention network (ST-GAT) using encoding and decoding structures to predict the flight trajectory. The encoder adopts a parallel structure of Transformer and GAT branches embedded with the multi-head self-attention mechanism in each front end. The Transformer branch network is used to extract the temporal characteristics of historical trajectories and capture the impact of the fighter's historical state on future trajectories, while the GAT branch network is used to extract spatial features in historical trajectories and capture potential spatial correlations between fighters.Then we concatenate the outputs of the two branches into a new feature vector and input it into a decoder composed of a fully connected network to predict the future position coordinates of the blue army fighter.The computer simulation results show that the proposed network significantly improves the prediction accuracy of flight trajectories compared to the enhanced CNN-LSTM network (ECNN-LSTM), with improvements of 47% and 34% in both ADE and FDE indicators,providing strong support for subsequent autonomous combat missions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Vehicle Using Iterative Reward Prediction in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12079v4)** | 2024-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional trajectory planning methods for autonomous vehicles have several limitations. For example, heuristic and explicit simple rules limit generalizability and hinder complex motions. These limitations can be addressed using reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning. However, reinforcement learning suffers from unstable learning, and existing reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning methods do not consider the uncertainties. Thus, this paper, proposes a reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning method for autonomous vehicles. The proposed method involves an iterative reward prediction approach that iteratively predicts expectations of future states. These predicted states are then used to forecast rewards and integrated into the learning process to enhance stability. Additionally, a method is proposed that utilizes uncertainty propagation to make the reinforcement learning agent aware of uncertainties. The proposed method was evaluated using the CARLA simulator. Compared to the baseline methods, the proposed method reduced the collision rate by 60.17 %, and increased the average reward by 30.82 times.

| **[Modeling Pedestrian Intrinsic Uncertainty for Multimodal Stochastic Trajectory Prediction via Energy Plan Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07164v1)** | 2024-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction plays a pivotal role in the realms of autonomous driving and smart cities. Despite extensive prior research employing sequence and generative models, the unpredictable nature of pedestrians, influenced by their social interactions and individual preferences, presents challenges marked by uncertainty and multimodality. In response, we propose the Energy Plan Denoising (EPD) model for stochastic trajectory prediction. EPD initially provides a coarse estimation of the distribution of future trajectories, termed the Plan, utilizing the Langevin Energy Model. Subsequently, it refines this estimation through denoising via the Probabilistic Diffusion Model. By initiating denoising with the Plan, EPD effectively reduces the need for iterative steps, thereby enhancing efficiency. Furthermore, EPD differs from conventional approaches by modeling the distribution of trajectories instead of individual trajectories. This allows for the explicit modeling of pedestrian intrinsic uncertainties and eliminates the need for multiple denoising operations. A single denoising operation produces a distribution from which multiple samples can be drawn, significantly enhancing efficiency. Moreover, EPD's fine-tuning of the Plan contributes to improved model performance. We validate EPD on two publicly available datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art results. Additionally, ablation experiments underscore the contributions of individual modules, affirming the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

An individual's inherent uncertainty, e.g., change of destination, can be masked by complex patterns resulting from the movements of interacting pedestrians. However, latent variable-based generative models often entangle such uncertainty with complexity, leading to limited either latent expressivity or predictive diversity. In this work, we propose to separately model these two factors by implicitly deriving a flexible latent representation to capture intricate pedestrian movements, while integrating predictive uncertainty of individuals with explicit bivariate Gaussian mixture densities over their future locations. More specifically, we present a model-agnostic uncertainty-aware pedestrian trajectory prediction framework, parameterizing sufficient statistics for the mixture of Gaussians that jointly comprise the multi-modal trajectories. We further estimate these parameters of interest by approximating a denoising process that progressively recovers pedestrian movements from noise. Unlike previous studies, we translate the predictive stochasticity to explicit distributions, allowing it to readily generate plausible future trajectories indicating individuals' self-uncertainty. Moreover, our framework is compatible with different neural net architectures. We empirically show the performance gains over state-of-the-art even with lighter backbones, across most scenes on two public benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention-aware Social Graph Transformer Networks for Stochastic Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15881v2)** | 2024-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is fundamental to various intelligent technologies, such as autonomous driving and robotics. The motion prediction of pedestrians and vehicles helps emergency braking, reduces collisions, and improves traffic safety. Current trajectory prediction research faces problems of complex social interactions, high dynamics and multi-modality. Especially, it still has limitations in long-time prediction. We propose Attention-aware Social Graph Transformer Networks for multi-modal trajectory prediction. We combine Graph Convolutional Networks and Transformer Networks by generating stable resolution pseudo-images from Spatio-temporal graphs through a designed stacking and interception method. Furthermore, we design the attention-aware module to handle social interaction information in scenarios involving mixed pedestrian-vehicle traffic. Thus, we maintain the advantages of the Graph and Transformer, i.e., the ability to aggregate information over an arbitrary number of neighbors and the ability to perform complex time-dependent data processing. We conduct experiments on datasets involving pedestrian, vehicle, and mixed trajectories, respectively. Our results demonstrate that our model minimizes displacement errors across various metrics and significantly reduces the likelihood of collisions. It is worth noting that our model effectively reduces the final displacement error, illustrating the ability of our model to predict for a long time.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

First, the detection network estimates the objects position and orientation in the image space. Furthermore, these are normalized and filtered. The direction and orientation is then the input to the trajectory planner, which considers the kinematic constrains of the used robotic system. This allows safe and stable control, since the kinematic boundary values are taken into account in planning. Also, by having direction estimation and velocity planner separated, the learning part of the method does not directly influence the control value. This also enables the transfer of the method to different robotic systems without retraining, therefore being robot agnostic. We evaluate our method on different visual servoing tasks with and without clutter on two different robotic systems. Our method achieved mean absolute position errors of <0.5 mm and orientation errors of <1{\deg}. Additionally, we transferred the method to a new system which differs in robot and camera, emphasizing robot agnostic capability of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

| **[Network analysis using Krylov subspace trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01269v2)** | 2024-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe a set of network analysis methods based on the rows of the Krylov subspace matrix computed from a network adjacency matrix via power iteration using a non-random initial vector. We refer to these node-specific row vectors as Krylov subspace trajectories. While power iteration using a random initial starting vector is commonly applied to the network adjacency matrix to compute eigenvector centrality values, this application only uses the final vector generated after numerical convergence. Importantly, use of a random initial vector means that the intermediate results of power iteration are also random and lack a clear interpretation. To the best of our knowledge, use of intermediate power iteration results for network analysis has been limited to techniques that leverage just a single pre-convergence solution, e.g., Power Iteration Clustering. In this paper, we explore methods that apply power iteration with a non-random inital vector to the network adjacency matrix to generate Krylov subspace trajectories for each node. These non-random trajectories provide important information regarding network structure, node importance, and response to perturbations. We have created this short preprint in part to generate feedback from others in the network analysis community who might be aware of similar existing work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Creating Geospatial Trajectories from Human Trafficking Text Corpora](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06130v1)** | 2024-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trafficking is a crime that affects the lives of millions of people across the globe. Traffickers exploit the victims through forced labor, involuntary sex, or organ harvesting. Migrant smuggling could also be seen as a form of human trafficking when the migrant fails to pay the smuggler and is forced into coerced activities. Several news agencies and anti-trafficking organizations have reported trafficking survivor stories that include the names of locations visited along the trafficking route. Identifying such routes can provide knowledge that is essential to preventing such heinous crimes. In this paper we propose a Narrative to Trajectory (N2T) information extraction system that analyzes reported narratives, extracts relevant information through the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, and applies geospatial augmentation in order to automatically plot trajectories of human trafficking routes. We evaluate N2T on human trafficking text corpora and demonstrate that our approach of utilizing data preprocessing and augmenting database techniques with NLP libraries outperforms existing geolocation detection methods.</p></details> |  |

As international laws are not fully set to deal with the migration crisis, people are relying on networks of exploiting smugglers to escape the devastation in order to live in stability. During the smuggling journey, migrants can become victims of human trafficking if they fail to pay the smuggler and may be forced into coerced labor. Government agencies and anti-trafficking organizations try to identify the trafficking routes based on stories of survivors in order to gain knowledge and help prevent such crimes. In this paper, we propose a system called Narrative to Trajectory (N2T+), which extracts trajectories of trafficking routes. N2T+ uses Data Science and Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze trafficking narratives, automatically extract relevant location names, disambiguate possible name ambiguities, and plot the trafficking route on a map. In a comparative evaluation we show that the proposed multi-dimensional approach offers significantly higher geolocation detection than other state of the art techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Almost Global Asymptotic Trajectory Tracking for Fully-Actuated Mechanical Systems on Homogeneous Riemannian Manifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04900v2)** | 2024-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we address the design of tracking controllers that drive a mechanical system's state asymptotically towards a reference trajectory. Motivated by aerospace and robotics applications, we consider fully-actuated systems evolving on the broad class of homogeneous spaces (encompassing all vector spaces, Lie groups, and spheres of any finite dimension). In this setting, the transitive action of a Lie group on the configuration manifold enables an intrinsic description of the tracking error as an element of the state space, even in the absence of a group structure on the configuration manifold itself (e.g., for $\mathbb{S}^2$). Such an error state facilitates the design of a generalized control policy depending smoothly on state and time, which drives the geometric tracking error to a designated origin from almost every initial condition, thereby guaranteeing almost global convergence to the reference trajectory. Moreover, the proposed controller simplifies elegantly when specialized to a Lie group or the n-sphere. In summary, we propose a unified, intrinsic controller guaranteeing almost global asymptotic trajectory tracking for fully-actuated mechanical systems evolving on a broad class of manifolds. We apply the method to an axisymmetric satellite and an omnidirectional aerial robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, sending raw data containing personal, sensitive information to cloud computing nodes may lead to privacy exposure issue.The privacy-preserving matrix completion is a useful approach to perform matrix completion while preserving privacy. In this paper, we propose a high-performance method for privacy-preserving matrix completion. First,we use a lightweight encryption scheme to encrypt the raw data and then perform matrix completion using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Then,the complemented matrix is decrypted and compared with the original matrix to calculate the error. This method has faster speed with higher accuracy. The results of numerical experiments reveal that the proposed method is faster than other algorithms.</p></details> | 7 pages, 10 figures |

Though existing notable efforts have resulted in impressive performance improvements, a gap persists in scene cognitive and understanding of the complex traffic semantics. This paper proposes Traj-LLM, the first to investigate the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) without explicit prompt engineering to generate future motion from agents' past/observed trajectories and scene semantics. Traj-LLM starts with sparse context joint coding to dissect the agent and scene features into a form that LLMs understand. On this basis, we innovatively explore LLMs' powerful comprehension abilities to capture a spectrum of high-level scene knowledge and interactive information. Emulating the human-like lane focus cognitive function and enhancing Traj-LLM's scene comprehension, we introduce lane-aware probabilistic learning powered by the pioneering Mamba module. Finally, a multi-modal Laplace decoder is designed to achieve scene-compliant multi-modal predictions. Extensive experiments manifest that Traj-LLM, fortified by LLMs' strong prior knowledge and understanding prowess, together with lane-aware probability learning, outstrips state-of-the-art methods across evaluation metrics. Moreover, the few-shot analysis further substantiates Traj-LLM's performance, wherein with just 50% of the dataset, it outperforms the majority of benchmarks relying on complete data utilization. This study explores equipping the trajectory prediction task with advanced capabilities inherent in LLMs, furnishing a more universal and adaptable solution for forecasting agent motion in a new way.</p></details> |  |

To enhance similarity measurement across diverse contexts, invariant motion descriptors have been proposed. However, for rigid-body motion, few invariant descriptors exist that are bi-invariant, meaning invariant to both the body and world reference frames used to describe the motion. Moreover, their robustness to singularities is limited. This paper introduces a novel Bi-Invariant Local Trajectory-Shape descriptor (BILTS) and a corresponding dissimilarity measure. Mathematical relationships between BILTS and existing descriptors are derived, providing new insights into their properties. The paper also includes an algorithm to reproduce the motion from the BILTS descriptor, demonstrating its bidirectionality and usefulness for trajectory generation. Experimental validation using datasets of daily-life activities shows the higher robustness of the BILTS descriptor compared to the bi-invariant ISA descriptor. This higher robustness supports the further application of bi-invariant descriptors for motion recognition and generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted as a regular research paper for consideration in the IEEE Transactions on Robotics.

| **[A Weighted Least-Squares Method for Non-Asymptotic Identification of Markov Parameters from Multiple Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04258v1)** | 2024-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Markov parameters play a key role in system identification. There exists many algorithms where these parameters are estimated using least-squares in a first, pre-processing, step, including subspace identification and multi-step least-squares algorithms, such as Weighted Null-Space Fitting. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in non-asymptotic analysis of estimation algorithms. In this contribution we identify the Markov parameters using weighted least-squares and present non-asymptotic analysis for such estimator. To cover both stable and unstable systems, multiple trajectories are collected. We show that with the optimal weighting matrix, weighted least-squares gives a tighter error bound than ordinary least-squares for the case of non-uniformly distributed measurement errors. Moreover, as the optimal weighting matrix depends on the system's true parameters, we introduce two methods to consistently estimate the optimal weighting matrix, where the convergence rate of these estimates is also provided. Numerical experiments demonstrate improvements of weighted least-squares over ordinary least-squares in finite sample settings.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods overlook complex interactions between traffic participants that often govern their future trajectories. In this paper, we propose SocialFormer, an agent interaction-aware trajectory prediction method that leverages the semantic relationship between the target vehicle and surrounding vehicles by making use of the road topology. We also introduce an edge-enhanced heterogeneous graph transformer (EHGT) as the aggregator in a graph neural network (GNN) to encode the semantic and spatial agent interaction information. Additionally, we introduce a temporal encoder based on gated recurrent units (GRU) to model the temporal social behavior of agent movements. Finally, we present an information fusion framework that integrates agent encoding, lane encoding, and agent interaction encoding for a holistic representation of the traffic scene. We evaluate SocialFormer for the trajectory prediction task on the popular nuScenes benchmark and achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

Our approach models all driving scenario elements in a unified model: the position of new agents, their initial state, and their future motion trajectories. By predicting the distributions of all these variables from a shared global scenario embedding, we ensure that the final generated scenario is fully conditioned on all available context in the existing scene. Our unified modeling approach, combined with autoregressive agent injection, conditions the placement and motion trajectory of every new agent on all existing agents and their trajectories, leading to realistic scenarios with low collision rates. Our experimental results show that UniGen outperforms prior state of the art on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICRA 2024</p></details> |

However, these methods do not model constraints crucial to ensure safety of the learned skill. Moreover, even when explicitly modelling constraints, they rely on the assumption of a known cost function, which limits their practical usability for task with unknown cost. In this work we propose a two-step optimization process that allow to estimate cost and constraints by decoupling the learning of cost functions from the identification of unknown constraints within the demonstrated trajectories. Initially, we identify the cost function by isolating the effect of constraints on parts of the demonstrations. Subsequently, a constraint leaning method is used to identify the unknown constraints. Our approach is validated both on simulated trajectories and a real robotic manipulation task. Our experiments show the impact that incorrect cost estimation has on the learned constraints and illustrate how the proposed method is able to infer unknown constraints, such as obstacles, from demonstrated trajectories without any initial knowledge of the cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |

Due to the limited acquisition capabilities of edge devices, a lot of trajectories are recorded at a low sampling rate, which may lead to the effectiveness drop of urban applications. We aim to recover a high-sampled trajectory based on the low-sampled trajectory in free space, i.e., without road network information, to enhance the usability of trajectory data and support urban applications more effectively. Recent proposals targeting trajectory recovery often assume that trajectories are available at a central location, which fail to handle the decentralized trajectories and hurt privacy. To bridge the gap between decentralized training and trajectory recovery, we propose a lightweight framework, LightTR, for federated trajectory recovery based on a client-server architecture, while keeping the data decentralized and private in each client/platform center (e.g., each data center of a company). Specifically, considering the limited processing capabilities of edge devices, LightTR encompasses a light local trajectory embedding module that offers improved computational efficiency without compromising its feature extraction capabilities. LightTR also features a meta-knowledge enhanced local-global training scheme to reduce communication costs between the server and clients and thus further offer efficiency improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was accepted by ICDE 2024</p></details> |
| **[REPLAY: Modeling Time-Varying Temporal Regularities of Human Mobility for Location Prediction over Sparse Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16310v2)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Location prediction forecasts a user's location based on historical user mobility traces. To tackle the intrinsic sparsity issue of real-world user mobility traces, spatiotemporal contexts have been shown as significantly useful. Existing solutions mostly incorporate spatiotemporal distances between locations in mobility traces, either by feeding them as additional inputs to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or by using them to search for informative past hidden states for prediction. However, such distance-based methods fail to capture the time-varying temporal regularities of human mobility, where human mobility is often more regular in the morning than in other periods, for example; this suggests the usefulness of the actual timestamps besides the temporal distances. Against this background, we propose REPLAY, a general RNN architecture learning to capture the time-varying temporal regularities for location prediction. Specifically, REPLAY not only resorts to the spatiotemporal distances in sparse trajectories to search for the informative past hidden states, but also accommodates the time-varying temporal regularities by incorporating smoothed timestamp embeddings using Gaussian weighted averaging with timestamp-specific learnable bandwidths, which can flexibly adapt to the temporal regularities of different strengths across different timestamps. Our extensive evaluation compares REPLAY against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on two real-world datasets. Results show that REPLAY consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.7\%-10.9\% in the location prediction task, and the bandwidths reveal interesting patterns of the time-varying temporal regularities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unscented Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02753v1)** | 2024-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a nutshell, unscented trajectory optimization is the generation of optimal trajectories through the use of an unscented transform. Although unscented trajectory optimization was introduced by the authors about a decade ago, it is reintroduced in this paper as a special instantiation of tychastic optimal control theory. Tychastic optimal control theory (from \textit{Tyche}, the Greek goddess of chance) avoids the use of a Brownian motion and the resulting It\^{o} calculus even though it uses random variables across the entire spectrum of a problem formulation. This approach circumvents the enormous technical and numerical challenges associated with stochastic trajectory optimization. Furthermore, it is shown how a tychastic optimal control problem that involves nonlinear transformations of the expectation operator can be quickly instantiated using an unscented transform. These nonlinear transformations are particularly useful in managing trajectory dispersions be it associated with path constraints or targeted values of final-time conditions. This paper also presents a systematic and rapid process for formulating and computing the most desirable tychastic trajectory using an unscented transform. Numerical examples are used to illustrate how unscented trajectory optimization may be used for risk reduction and mission recovery caused by uncertainties and failures.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 11 figures 2023 AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference, Big Sky, MT, Aug 13-17, 2023</p></details> |

This paper presents a deep representation learningbased phenotyping method to identify distinct groups of clinical trajectories of septic patients with ARF. For this retrospective study, we created a dataset from electronic medical records (EMR) consisting of data from sepsis patients admitted to medical intensive care units who required at least 24 hours of invasive mechanical ventilation at a quarternary care academic hospital in southeast USA for the years 2016-2021. A total of N=3349 patient encounters were included in this study. Clustering Representation Learning on Incomplete Time Series Data (CRLI) algorithm was applied to a parsimonious set of EMR variables in this data set. To validate the optimal number of clusters, the K-means algorithm was used in conjunction with dynamic time warping. Our model yielded four distinct patient phenotypes that were characterized as liver dysfunction/heterogeneous, hypercapnia, hypoxemia, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome by a critical care expert. A Kaplan-Meier analysis to compare the 28-day mortality trends exhibited significant differences (p < 0.005) between the four phenotypes. The study demonstrates the utility of our deep representation learning-based approach in unraveling phenotypes that reflect the heterogeneity in sepsis-induced ARF in terms of different mortality outcomes and severity. These phenotypes might reveal important clinical insights into an effective prognosis and tailored treatment strategies.</p></details> | 9 pages |

A successful strategy to reduce computation time involves using Imitation Learning (IL) to develop fast neural network (NN) policies from those planners, which are treated as expert demonstrators. Although the resulting NN policies are effective at quickly generating trajectories similar to those from the expert, (1) their output does not explicitly account for dynamic feasibility, and (2) the policies do not accommodate changes in the constraints different from those used during training. To overcome these limitations, we propose Constraint-Guided Diffusion (CGD), a novel IL-based approach to trajectory planning. CGD leverages a hybrid learning/online optimization scheme that combines diffusion policies with a surrogate efficient optimization problem, enabling the generation of collision-free, dynamically feasible trajectories. The key ideas of CGD include dividing the original challenging optimization problem solved by the expert into two more manageable sub-problems: (a) efficiently finding collision-free paths, and (b) determining a dynamically-feasible time-parametrization for those paths to obtain a trajectory. Compared to conventional neural network architectures, we demonstrate through numerical evaluations significant improvements in performance and dynamic feasibility under scenarios with new constraints never encountered during training.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

In this regard, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data plays a significant role by offering real-time streaming data on vessel movement, allowing enhanced traffic monitoring. This study explores using AIS data to prevent vessel-to-whale collisions by forecasting long-term vessel trajectories from engineered AIS data sequences. For such a task, we have developed an encoder-decoder model architecture using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (Bi-LSTM) to predict the next 12 hours of vessel trajectories using 1 to 3 hours of AIS data as input. We feed the model with probabilistic features engineered from historical AIS data that refer to each trajectory's potential route and destination. The model then predicts the vessel's trajectory, considering these additional features by leveraging convolutional layers for spatial feature learning and a position-aware attention mechanism that increases the importance of recent timesteps of a sequence during temporal feature learning. The probabilistic features have an F1 Score of approximately 85% and 75% for each feature type, respectively, demonstrating their effectiveness in augmenting information to the neural network. We test our model on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, a region known to be the habitat of North Atlantic Right Whales (NARW). Our model achieved a high R2 score of over 98% using various techniques and features. It stands out among other approaches as it can make complex decisions during turnings and path selection. Our study highlights the potential of data engineering and trajectory forecasting models for marine life species preservation.</p></details> |  |

Though the problem is rather ancient, apart from the fact that the previous approaches have never considered user- and time-specific QoS, we point out a prevalent mistake in coordinate optimization approaches adopted by the majority of the literature. Coordinate optimization approaches, which repetitively optimize radio resources for a fixed trajectory and vice versa, generally converge to local optima when all variables are differentiable. However, these methods often stagnate at a non-stationary point, significantly degrading the network utility in mixed-integer problems such as joint trajectory and radio resource optimization. We detour this problem by converting the formulated problem into the Markov decision process (MDP). Exploiting the beneficial characteristics of the MDP, we design a non-iterative framework that cooperatively optimizes trajectory and radio resources without initial trajectory choice. The proposed framework can incorporate various trajectory planning algorithms such as the genetic algorithm, tree search, and reinforcement learning. Extensive comparisons with diverse baselines verify that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method, nearly achieving the global optimum.

Evaluations on the Argoverse, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD datasets underscore MFTraj's robustness and adaptability, outperforming numerous benchmarks even in data-challenged scenarios without the need for additional information such as HD maps or vectorized maps. Importantly, it maintains competitive performance even in scenarios with substantial missing data, on par with most existing state-of-the-art models. The results and methodology suggest a significant advancement in autonomous driving trajectory prediction, paving the way for safer and more efficient autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2024</p></details> |

However, current methods only apply to rather simple reports, like multiple-choice or scalar numbers. We aim to broaden these techniques to the larger domain of text-based reports, drawing on the recent developments in large language models. This vastly increases the applicability of peer prediction mechanisms as textual feedback is the norm in a large variety of feedback channels: peer reviews, e-commerce customer reviews, and comments on social media. We introduce two mechanisms, the Generative Peer Prediction Mechanism (GPPM) and the Generative Synopsis Peer Prediction Mechanism (GSPPM). These mechanisms utilize LLMs as predictors, mapping from one agent's report to a prediction of her peer's report. Theoretically, we show that when the LLM prediction is sufficiently accurate, our mechanisms can incentivize high effort and truth-telling as an (approximate) Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Empirically, we confirm the efficacy of our mechanisms through experiments conducted on two real datasets: the Yelp review dataset and the ICLR OpenReview dataset. We highlight the results that on the ICLR dataset, our mechanisms can differentiate three quality levels -- human-written reviews, GPT-4-generated reviews, and GPT-3.5-generated reviews in terms of expected scores. Additionally, GSPPM penalizes LLM-generated reviews more effectively than GPPM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the Twenty-Fifth ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (EC'24)</p></details> |
| **[LLaMA-NAS: Efficient Neural Architecture Search for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18377v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The abilities of modern large language models (LLMs) in solving natural language processing, complex reasoning, sentiment analysis and other tasks have been extraordinary which has prompted their extensive adoption. Unfortunately, these abilities come with very high memory and computational costs which precludes the use of LLMs on most hardware platforms. To mitigate this, we propose an effective method of finding Pareto-optimal network architectures based on LLaMA2-7B using one-shot NAS. In particular, we fine-tune LLaMA2-7B only once and then apply genetic algorithm-based search to find smaller, less computationally complex network architectures. We show that, for certain standard benchmark tasks, the pre-trained LLaMA2-7B network is unnecessarily large and complex. More specifically, we demonstrate a 1.5x reduction in model size and 1.3x speedup in throughput for certain tasks with negligible drop in accuracy. In addition to finding smaller, higher-performing network architectures, our method does so more effectively and efficiently than certain pruning or sparsification techniques. Finally, we demonstrate how quantization is complementary to our method and that the size and complexity of the networks we find can be further decreased using quantization. We believe that our work provides a way to automatically create LLMs which can be used on less expensive and more readily available hardware platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROPO: Robust Preference Optimization for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04102v2)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference alignment is pivotal for empowering large language models (LLMs) to generate helpful and harmless responses. However, the performance of preference alignment is highly sensitive to the prevalent noise in the preference data. Recent efforts for this problem either marginally alleviate the impact of noise without the ability to actually reduce its presence, or rely on costly teacher LLMs prone to reward misgeneralization. To address these challenges, we propose the RObust Preference Optimization (ROPO) framework, an iterative alignment approach that integrates noise-tolerance and filtering of noisy samples without the aid of external models. Specifically, ROPO iteratively solves a constrained optimization problem, where we dynamically assign a quality-aware weight for each sample and constrain the sum of the weights to the number of samples we intend to retain. For noise-tolerant training and effective noise identification, we derive a robust loss by suppressing the gradients of samples with high uncertainty. We demonstrate both empirically and theoretically that the derived loss is critical for distinguishing noisy samples from clean ones. Furthermore, inspired by our derived loss, we propose a robustness-guided rejection sampling technique to compensate for the potential important information in discarded queries. Experiments on three widely-used datasets with Mistral-7B and Llama-2-7B demonstrate that ROPO significantly outperforms existing preference alignment methods, with its superiority growing as the noise rate increases.</p></details> |  |

We examine the TCO and performance metrics of a domain-adaptive LLM, ChipNeMo, against two leading LLMs, Claude 3 Opus and ChatGPT-4 Turbo, to assess their efficacy in chip design coding generation. Through a detailed evaluation of the accuracy of the model, training methodologies, and operational expenditures, this study aims to provide stakeholders with critical information to select the most economically viable and performance-efficient solutions for their specific needs. Our results underscore the benefits of employing domain-adapted models, such as ChipNeMo, that demonstrate improved performance at significantly reduced costs compared to their general-purpose counterparts. In particular, we reveal the potential of domain-adapted LLMs to decrease TCO by approximately 90%-95%, with the cost advantages becoming increasingly evident as the deployment scale expands. With expansion of deployment, the cost benefits of ChipNeMo become more pronounced, making domain-adaptive LLMs an attractive option for organizations with substantial coding needs supported by LLMs</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted in IEEE-ACM conference: 2024 IEEE LLM-Aided Design Workshop (LAD)</p></details> |

Due to the opacity in their parameters, embeddings, and even output probabilities, existing fine-tuning adaptation methods are inapplicable. Consequently, adapting these black-box LLMs is only possible through their API services, raising concerns about transparency, privacy, and cost. To address these challenges, we introduce BBox-Adapter, a novel lightweight adapter for black-box LLMs. BBox-Adapter distinguishes target and source domain data by treating target data as positive and source data as negative. It employs a ranking-based Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) loss to promote the likelihood of target domain data while penalizing that of the source domain. Furthermore, it features an online adaptation mechanism, which incorporates real-time positive data sampling from ground-truth, human, or AI feedback, coupled with negative data from previous adaptations. Extensive experiments demonstrate BBox-Adapter's effectiveness and cost efficiency. It improves model performance by up to 6.77% across diverse tasks and domains, while reducing training and inference costs by 31.30x and 1.84x, respectively.</p></details> | 25 pages, 10 figures |

Doing so includes many degrees of freedom: which model should be used; how should it be prompted; should it be asked to introspect, conduct chain-of-thought reasoning, etc? Settling these questions -- and more broadly, determining whether an LLM agent is reliable enough to be trusted -- requires a methodology for assessing such an agent's economic rationality. In this paper, we provide one. We begin by surveying the economic literature on rational decision making, taxonomizing a large set of fine-grained "elements" that an agent should exhibit, along with dependencies between them. We then propose a benchmark distribution that quantitatively scores an LLMs performance on these elements and, combined with a user-provided rubric, produces a "STEER report card." Finally, we describe the results of a large-scale empirical experiment with 14 different LLMs, characterizing the both current state of the art and the impact of different model sizes on models' ability to exhibit rational behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Scale Knowledge Washing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16720v2)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models show impressive abilities in memorizing world knowledge, which leads to concerns regarding memorization of private information, toxic or sensitive knowledge, and copyrighted content. We introduce the problem of Large Scale Knowledge Washing, focusing on unlearning an extensive amount of factual knowledge. Previous unlearning methods usually define the reverse loss and update the model via backpropagation, which may affect the model's fluency and reasoning ability or even destroy the model due to extensive training with the reverse loss. Existing works introduce additional data from downstream tasks to prevent the model from losing capabilities, which requires downstream task awareness. Controlling the tradeoff of unlearning and maintaining existing capabilities is also challenging. To this end, we propose LAW (Large Scale Washing) to update the MLP layers in decoder-only large language models to perform knowledge washing, as inspired by model editing methods and based on the hypothesis that knowledge and reasoning are disentanglable. We derive a new objective with the knowledge to be unlearned to update the weights of certain MLP layers. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LAW in forgetting target knowledge while maintaining reasoning ability. The code will be open-sourced at https://github.com/wangyu-ustc/LargeScaleWashing.</p></details> |  |

We present a comprehensive evaluation framework, grounded in science communication research, to assess LLM responses to questions about climate change. Our framework emphasizes both presentational and epistemological adequacy, offering a fine-grained analysis of LLM generations spanning 8 dimensions and 30 issues. Our evaluation task is a real-world example of a growing number of challenging problems where AI can complement and lift human performance. We introduce a novel protocol for scalable oversight that relies on AI Assistance and raters with relevant education. We evaluate several recent LLMs on a set of diverse climate questions. Our results point to a significant gap between surface and epistemological qualities of LLMs in the realm of climate communication.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages LLMs as pattern recognition tools to improve MHs. The resulting hybrid method, tested in the context of a social network-based combinatorial optimization problem, outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches that combine machine learning with MHs regarding the obtained solution quality. By carefully designing prompts, we demonstrate that the output obtained from LLMs can be used as problem knowledge, leading to improved results. Lastly, we acknowledge LLMs' potential drawbacks and limitations and consider it essential to examine them to advance this type of research further.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for publication in an international journal</p></details> |
| **[Active Use of Latent Constituency Representation in both Humans and Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18241v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how sentences are internally represented in the human brain, as well as in large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, is a major challenge for cognitive science. Classic linguistic theories propose that the brain represents a sentence by parsing it into hierarchically organized constituents. In contrast, LLMs do not explicitly parse linguistic constituents and their latent representations remains poorly explained. Here, we demonstrate that humans and LLMs construct similar latent representations of hierarchical linguistic constituents by analyzing their behaviors during a novel one-shot learning task, in which they infer which words should be deleted from a sentence. Both humans and LLMs tend to delete a constituent, instead of a nonconstituent word string. In contrast, a naive sequence processing model that has access to word properties and ordinal positions does not show this property. Based on the word deletion behaviors, we can reconstruct the latent constituency tree representation of a sentence for both humans and LLMs. These results demonstrate that a latent tree-structured constituency representation can emerge in both the human brain and LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>62 pa...</summary><p>62 pages, 5 figures.

While societal biases and stereotypes have been extensively researched in various NLP applications, there is a surprising gap for emotion analysis. However, emotion and gender are closely linked in societal discourse. E.g., women are often thought of as more empathetic, while men's anger is more socially accepted. To fill this gap, we present the first comprehensive study of gendered emotion attribution in five state-of-the-art LLMs (open- and closed-source). We investigate whether emotions are gendered, and whether these variations are based on societal stereotypes. We prompt the models to adopt a gendered persona and attribute emotions to an event like 'When I had a serious argument with a dear person'. We then analyze the emotions generated by the models in relation to the gender-event pairs. We find that all models consistently exhibit gendered emotions, influenced by gender stereotypes. These findings are in line with established research in psychology and gender studies. Our study sheds light on the complex societal interplay between language, gender, and emotion. The reproduction of emotion stereotypes in LLMs allows us to use those models to study the topic in detail, but raises questions about the predictive use of those same LLMs for emotion applications.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL 2024 |

However, such models contain billions of parameters making large compute a necessity, while raising environmental concerns. To address these issues, we propose FinerCut, a new form of fine-grained layer pruning, which in contrast to prior work at the transformer block level, considers all self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) layers within blocks as individual pruning candidates. FinerCut prunes layers whose removal causes minimal alternation to the model's output -- contributing to a new, lean, interpretable, and task-agnostic pruning method. Tested across 9 benchmarks, our approach retains 90% performance of Llama3-8B with 25% layers removed, and 95% performance of Llama3-70B with 30% layers removed, all without fine-tuning or post-pruning reconstruction. Strikingly, we observe intriguing results with FinerCut: 42% (34 out of 80) of the self-attention layers in Llama3-70B can be removed while preserving 99% of its performance -- without additional fine-tuning after removal. Moreover, FinerCut provides a tool to inspect the types and locations of pruned layers, allowing to observe interesting pruning behaviors. For instance, we observe a preference for pruning self-attention layers, often at deeper consecutive decoder layers. We hope our insights inspire future efficient LLM architecture designs.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[PiSSA: Principal Singular Values and Singular Vectors Adaptation of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02948v3)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To parameter-efficiently fine-tune (PEFT) large language models (LLMs), the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) method approximates the model changes $\Delta W \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ through the product of two matrices $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times r}$ and $B \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times n}$, where $r \ll \min(m, n)$, $A$ is initialized with Gaussian noise, and $B$ with zeros. LoRA freezes the original model $W$ and updates the "Noise & Zero" adapter, which may lead to slow convergence. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Principal Singular values and Singular vectors Adaptation (PiSSA). PiSSA shares the same architecture as LoRA, but initializes the adaptor matrices $A$ and $B$ with the principal components of the original matrix $W$, and put the remaining components into a residual matrix $W^{res} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ which is frozen during fine-tuning. Compared to LoRA, PiSSA updates the principal components while freezing the "residual" parts, allowing faster convergence and enhanced performance. Comparative experiments of PiSSA and LoRA across 12 different models, ranging from 184M to 70B, encompassing 5 NLG and 8 NLU tasks, reveal that PiSSA consistently outperforms LoRA under identical experimental setups. On the GSM8K benchmark, Mistral-7B fine-tuned with PiSSA achieves an accuracy of 72.86%, surpassing LoRA's 67.7% by 5.16%. Due to the same architecture, PiSSA is also compatible with quantization to further reduce the memory requirement of fine-tuning. Compared to QLoRA, QPiSSA (PiSSA with 4-bit quantization) exhibits smaller quantization errors in the initial stages. Fine-tuning LLaMA-3-70B on GSM8K, QPiSSA attains an accuracy of 86.05%, exceeding the performances of QLoRA at 81.73%. Leveraging a fast SVD technique, PiSSA can be initialized in only a few seconds, presenting a negligible cost for transitioning from LoRA to PiSSA.</p></details> |  |
| **[IAPT: Instruction-Aware Prompt Tuning for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18203v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soft prompt tuning is a widely studied parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. However, it has a clear drawback: many soft tokens must be inserted into the input sequences to guarantee downstream performance. As a result, soft prompt tuning is less considered than Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) in the large language modeling (LLM) era. In this work, we propose a novel prompt tuning method, Instruction-Aware Prompt Tuning (IAPT), that requires only four soft tokens. First, we install a parameter-efficient soft prompt generator at each Transformer layer to generate idiosyncratic soft prompts for each input instruction. The generated soft prompts can be seen as a semantic summary of the input instructions and can effectively guide the output generation. Second, the soft prompt generators are modules with a bottleneck architecture consisting of a self-attention pooling operation, two linear projections, and an activation function. Pilot experiments show that prompt generators at different Transformer layers require different activation functions. Thus, we propose to learn the idiosyncratic activation functions for prompt generators automatically with the help of rational functions. We have conducted experiments on various tasks, and the experimental results demonstrate that (a) our IAPT method can outperform the recent baselines with comparable tunable parameters. (b) Our IAPT method is more efficient than LoRA under the single-backbone multi-tenant setting.</p></details> | Accepted by ACL-2024 |

Despite this, their application to information retrieval (IR) tasks is still challenging due to the infrequent occurrence of many IR-specific concepts in natural language. While prompt-based methods can provide task descriptions to LLMs, they often fall short in facilitating a comprehensive understanding and execution of IR tasks, thereby limiting LLMs' applicability. To address this gap, in this work, we explore the potential of instruction tuning to enhance LLMs' proficiency in IR tasks. We introduce a novel instruction tuning dataset, INTERS, encompassing 20 tasks across three fundamental IR categories: query understanding, document understanding, and query-document relationship understanding. The data are derived from 43 distinct datasets with manually written templates. Our empirical results reveal that INTERS significantly boosts the performance of various publicly available LLMs, such as LLaMA, Mistral, and Phi, in IR tasks. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the effects of instruction design, template diversity, few-shot demonstrations, and the volume of instructions on performance.

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) offers a promising solution for LLM compression. However, state-of-the-art SVD-based LLM compression methods have two key limitations: truncating smaller singular values may lead to higher compression loss, and the lack of update on the compressed weight after SVD truncation. In this work, we propose SVD-LLM, a new SVD-based LLM compression method that addresses the limitations of existing methods. SVD-LLM incorporates a truncation-aware data whitening strategy to ensure a direct mapping between singular values and compression loss. Moreover, SVD-LLM adopts a layer-wise closed-form model parameter update strategy to compensate for accuracy degradation under high compression ratios. We evaluate SVD-LLM on a total of 10 datasets and eight models from three different LLM families at four different scales. Our results demonstrate the superiority of SVD-LLM over state-of-the-arts, especially at high model compression ratios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at: https://github.com/AIoT-MLSys-Lab/SVD-LLM</p></details> |
| **[Defending Large Language Models Against Jailbreak Attacks via Layer-specific Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18166v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in a wide range of real-world applications. Despite their impressive performance, recent studies have shown that LLMs are vulnerable to deliberately crafted adversarial prompts even when aligned via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback or supervised fine-tuning. While existing defense methods focus on either detecting harmful prompts or reducing the likelihood of harmful responses through various means, defending LLMs against jailbreak attacks based on the inner mechanisms of LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate how LLMs response to harmful prompts and propose a novel defense method termed \textbf{L}ayer-specific \textbf{Ed}iting (LED) to enhance the resilience of LLMs against jailbreak attacks. Through LED, we reveal that several critical \textit{safety layers} exist among the early layers of LLMs. We then show that realigning these safety layers (and some selected additional layers) with the decoded safe response from selected target layers can significantly improve the alignment of LLMs against jailbreak attacks. Extensive experiments across various LLMs (e.g., Llama2, Mistral) show the effectiveness of LED, which effectively defends against jailbreak attacks while maintaining performance on benign prompts.

| **[Lumen: Unleashing Versatile Vision-Centric Capabilities of Large Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07304v2)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Multimodal Model (LMM) is a hot research topic in the computer vision area and has also demonstrated remarkable potential across multiple disciplinary fields. A recent trend is to further extend and enhance the perception capabilities of LMMs. The current methods follow the paradigm of adapting the visual task outputs to the format of the language model, which is the main component of a LMM. This adaptation leads to convenient development of such LMMs with minimal modifications, however, it overlooks the intrinsic characteristics of diverse visual tasks and hinders the learning of perception capabilities. To address this issue, we propose a novel LMM architecture named Lumen, a Large multimodal model with versatile vision-centric capability enhancement. We decouple the LMM's learning of perception capabilities into task-agnostic and task-specific stages. Lumen first promotes fine-grained vision-language concept alignment, which is the fundamental capability for various visual tasks. Thus the output of the task-agnostic stage is a shared representation for all the tasks we address in this paper. Then the task-specific decoding is carried out by flexibly routing the shared representation to lightweight task decoders with negligible training efforts. Comprehensive experimental results on a series of vision-centric and VQA benchmarks indicate that our Lumen model not only achieves or surpasses the performance of existing LMM-based approaches in a range of vision-centric tasks while maintaining general visual understanding and instruction following capabilities. The code will be released at https://github.com/SxJyJay/Lumen.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[Facilitating Multi-Role and Multi-Behavior Collaboration of Large Language Models for Online Job Seeking and Recruiting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18113v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of online recruitment services has revolutionized the traditional landscape of job seeking and recruitment, necessitating the development of high-quality industrial applications to improve person-job fitting. Existing methods generally rely on modeling the latent semantics of resumes and job descriptions and learning a matching function between them. Inspired by the powerful role-playing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose to introduce a mock interview process between LLM-played interviewers and candidates. The mock interview conversations can provide additional evidence for candidate evaluation, thereby augmenting traditional person-job fitting based solely on resumes and job descriptions. However, characterizing these two roles in online recruitment still presents several challenges, such as developing the skills to raise interview questions, formulating appropriate answers, and evaluating two-sided fitness. To this end, we propose MockLLM, a novel applicable framework that divides the person-job matching process into two modules: mock interview generation and two-sided evaluation in handshake protocol, jointly enhancing their performance through collaborative behaviors between interviewers and candidates. We design a role-playing framework as a multi-role and multi-behavior paradigm to enable a single LLM agent to effectively behave with multiple functions for both parties. Moreover, we propose reflection memory generation and dynamic prompt modification techniques to refine the behaviors of both sides, enabling continuous optimization of the augmented additional evidence. Extensive experimental results show that MockLLM can achieve the best performance on person-job matching accompanied by high mock interview quality, envisioning its emerging application in real online recruitment in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pipette: Automatic Fine-grained Large Language Model Training Configurator for Real-World Clusters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18093v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large language models (LLMs) is known to be challenging because of the huge computational and memory capacity requirements. To address these issues, it is common to use a cluster of GPUs with 3D parallelism, which splits a model along the data batch, pipeline stage, and intra-layer tensor dimensions. However, the use of 3D parallelism produces the additional challenge of finding the optimal number of ways on each dimension and mapping the split models onto the GPUs. Several previous studies have attempted to automatically find the optimal configuration, but many of these lacked several important aspects. For instance, the heterogeneous nature of the interconnect speeds is often ignored. While the peak bandwidths for the interconnects are usually made equal, the actual attained bandwidth varies per link in real-world clusters. Combined with the critical path modeling that does not properly consider the communication, they easily fall into sub-optimal configurations. In addition, they often fail to consider the memory requirement per GPU, often recommending solutions that could not be executed. To address these challenges, we propose Pipette, which is an automatic fine-grained LLM training configurator for real-world clusters. By devising better performance models along with the memory estimator and fine-grained individual GPU assignment, Pipette achieves faster configurations that satisfy the memory constraints. We evaluated Pipette on large clusters to show that it provides a significant speedup over the prior art. The implementation of Pipette is available at https://github.com/yimjinkyu1/date2024_pipette.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published at DATE 2024</p></details> |

However, there is also growing concern on their safety implications, making a comprehensive safety evaluation for LLMs urgently needed before model deployment. In this work, we propose S-Eval, a new comprehensive, multi-dimensional and open-ended safety evaluation benchmark. At the core of S-Eval is a novel LLM-based automatic test prompt generation and selection framework, which trains an expert testing LLM Mt combined with a range of test selection strategies to automatically construct a high-quality test suite for the safety evaluation. The key to the automation of this process is a novel expert safety-critique LLM Mc able to quantify the riskiness score of an LLM's response, and additionally produce risk tags and explanations. Besides, the generation process is also guided by a carefully designed risk taxonomy with four different levels, covering comprehensive and multi-dimensional safety risks of concern. Based on these, we systematically construct a new and large-scale safety evaluation benchmark for LLMs consisting of 220,000 evaluation prompts, including 20,000 base risk prompts (10,000 in Chinese and 10,000 in English) and 200,000 corresponding attack prompts derived from 10 popular adversarial instruction attacks against LLMs. Moreover, considering the rapid evolution of LLMs and accompanied safety threats, S-Eval can be flexibly configured and adapted to include new risks, attacks and models. S-Eval is extensively evaluated on 20 popular and representative LLMs. The results confirm that S-Eval can better reflect and inform the safety risks of LLMs compared to existing benchmarks. We also explore the impacts of parameter scales, language environments, and decoding parameters on the evaluation, providing a systematic methodology for evaluating the safety of LLMs.</p></details> | 18 pages, 11 figures |

As mobile networks evolve towards the 6G era, managing their increasing complexity and dynamic nature poses significant challenges. Conventional RL approaches often suffer from slow convergence and poor generalization due to conflicting objectives and the large state and action spaces associated with mobile networks. To address these shortcomings, we introduce curriculum learning, a method that systematically exposes the RL agent to progressively challenging tasks, improving convergence and generalization. However, curriculum design typically requires extensive domain knowledge and manual human effort. Our framework mitigates this by utilizing the generative capabilities of LLMs to automate the curriculum design process, significantly reducing human effort while improving the RL agent's convergence and performance. We deploy our approach within a simulated mobile network environment and demonstrate improved RL convergence rates, generalization to unseen scenarios, and overall performance enhancements. As a case study, we consider autonomous coordination and user association in mobile networks. Our obtained results highlight the potential of combining LLM-based curriculum generation with RL for managing next-generation wireless networks, marking a significant step towards fully autonomous network operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Proc.

In this study, we evaluate the capability of general LLMs, specifically GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to identify and correct medical errors with multiple prompting strategies. Recognising the limitation of LLMs in generating accurate corrections only via prompting strategies, we propose incorporating error-span predictions from a smaller, fine-tuned model in two ways: 1) by presenting it as a hint in the prompt and 2) by framing it as multiple-choice questions from which the LLM can choose the best correction. We found that our proposed prompting strategies significantly improve the LLM's ability to generate corrections. Our best-performing solution with 8-shot + CoT + hints ranked sixth in the shared task leaderboard. Additionally, our comprehensive analyses show the impact of the location of the error sentence, the prompted role, and the position of the multiple-choice option on the accuracy of the LLM. This prompts further questions about the readiness of LLM to be implemented in real-world clinical settings.</p></details> |  |

This situates characters at specific moments in the narrative progression for three main reasons: (i) enhancing users' narrative immersion, (ii) avoiding spoilers, and (iii) fostering engagement in fandom role-playing. To accurately represent characters at specific time points, agents must avoid character hallucination, where they display knowledge that contradicts their characters' identities and historical timelines. We introduce TimeChara, a new benchmark designed to evaluate point-in-time character hallucination in role-playing LLMs. Comprising 10,895 instances generated through an automated pipeline, this benchmark reveals significant hallucination issues in current state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o). To counter this challenge, we propose Narrative-Experts, a method that decomposes the reasoning steps and utilizes narrative experts to reduce point-in-time character hallucinations effectively. Still, our findings with TimeChara highlight the ongoing challenges of point-in-time character hallucination, calling for further study.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2024 Findings.

However, most of these efforts either concentrate on memory reduction or spatial space division, neglecting information in the semantic space. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named SA-GS, for fine-grained 3D geometry reconstruction using semantic-aware 3D Gaussian Splats. Specifically, we leverage prior information stored in large vision models such as SAM and DINO to generate semantic masks. We then introduce a geometric complexity measurement function to serve as soft regularization, guiding the shape of each Gaussian Splat within specific semantic areas. Additionally, we present a method that estimates the expected number of Gaussian Splats in different semantic areas, effectively providing a lower bound for Gaussian Splats in these areas. Subsequently, we extract the point cloud using a novel probability density-based extraction method, transforming Gaussian Splats into a point cloud crucial for downstream tasks. Our method also offers the potential for detailed semantic inquiries while maintaining high image-based reconstruction results. We provide extensive experiments on publicly available large-scale scene reconstruction datasets with highly accurate point clouds as ground truth and our novel dataset. Our results demonstrate the superiority of our method over current state-of-the-art Gaussian Splats reconstruction methods by a significant margin in terms of geometric-based measurement metrics. Code and additional results will soon be available on our project page.</p></details> | <details><summary>Might...</summary><p>Might need more comparison, will be add later</p></details> |
| **[Exploring Context Window of Large Language Models via Decomposed Positional Vectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18009v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) typically have a limited context window, resulting in significant performance degradation when processing text beyond the length of the context window. Extensive studies have been proposed to extend the context window and achieve length extrapolation of LLMs, but there is still a lack of in-depth interpretation of these approaches. In this study, we explore the positional information within and beyond the context window for deciphering the underlying mechanism of LLMs. By using a mean-based decomposition method, we disentangle positional vectors from hidden states of LLMs and analyze their formation and effect on attention. Furthermore, when texts exceed the context window, we analyze the change of positional vectors in two settings, i.e., direct extrapolation and context window extension. Based on our findings, we design two training-free context window extension methods, positional vector replacement and attention window extension. Experimental results show that our methods can effectively extend the context window length.</p></details> |  |

We construct a benchmark, SafeEdit, which covers nine unsafe categories with various powerful attack prompts and equips comprehensive metrics for systematic evaluation. We conduct experiments with several knowledge editing approaches, indicating that knowledge editing has the potential to detoxify LLMs with a limited impact on general performance efficiently. Then, we propose a simple yet effective baseline, dubbed Detoxifying with Intraoperative Neural Monitoring (DINM), to diminish the toxicity of LLMs within a few tuning steps via only one instance. We further provide an in-depth analysis of the internal mechanism for various detoxifying approaches, demonstrating that previous methods like SFT and DPO may merely suppress the activations of toxic parameters, while DINM mitigates the toxicity of the toxic parameters to a certain extent, making permanent adjustments. We hope that these insights could shed light on future work of developing detoxifying approaches and the underlying knowledge mechanisms of LLMs. Code and benchmark are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2024.

Despite growing attention and rapid advancements in this field, the existing literature remains fragmented and lacks systematic organization, posing barriers to entry for newcomers. This gap motivates us to conduct a comprehensive survey of existing works on tool learning with LLMs. In this survey, we focus on reviewing existing literature from the two primary aspects (1) why tool learning is beneficial and (2) how tool learning is implemented, enabling a comprehensive understanding of tool learning with LLMs. We first explore the "why" by reviewing both the benefits of tool integration and the inherent benefits of the tool learning paradigm from six specific aspects. In terms of "how", we systematically review the literature according to a taxonomy of four key stages in the tool learning workflow: task planning, tool selection, tool calling, and response generation. Additionally, we provide a detailed summary of existing benchmarks and evaluation methods, categorizing them according to their relevance to different stages. Finally, we discuss current challenges and outline potential future directions, aiming to inspire both researchers and industrial developers to further explore this emerging and promising area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Entity Alignment with Noisy Annotations from Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16806v2)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Entity alignment (EA) aims to merge two knowledge graphs (KGs) by identifying equivalent entity pairs. While existing methods heavily rely on human-generated labels, it is prohibitively expensive to incorporate cross-domain experts for annotation in real-world scenarios. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents new avenues for automating EA with annotations, inspired by their comprehensive capability to process semantic information. However, it is nontrivial to directly apply LLMs for EA since the annotation space in real-world KGs is large. LLMs could also generate noisy labels that may mislead the alignment. To this end, we propose a unified framework, LLM4EA, to effectively leverage LLMs for EA. Specifically, we design a novel active learning policy to significantly reduce the annotation space by prioritizing the most valuable entities based on the entire inter-KG and intra-KG structure. Moreover, we introduce an unsupervised label refiner to continuously enhance label accuracy through in-depth probabilistic reasoning. We iteratively optimize the policy based on the feedback from a base EA model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of LLM4EA on four benchmark datasets in terms of effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency. Codes are available via https://github.com/chensyCN/llm4ea_official.</p></details> |  |

However, testing this theory remains challenging due to two reasons: the difficulty in defining what tasks are ecologically valid and building rational models for these tasks. In this work, we demonstrate that large language models can generate cognitive tasks, specifically category learning tasks, that match the statistics of real-world tasks, thereby addressing the first challenge. We tackle the second challenge by deriving rational agents adapted to these tasks using the framework of meta-learning, leading to a class of models called ecologically rational meta-learned inference (ERMI). ERMI quantitatively explains human data better than seven other cognitive models in two different experiments. It additionally matches human behavior on a qualitative level: (1) it finds the same tasks difficult that humans find difficult, (2) it becomes more reliant on an exemplar-based strategy for assigning categories with learning, and (3) it generalizes to unseen stimuli in a human-like way. Furthermore, we show that ERMI's ecologically valid priors allow it to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the OpenML-CC18 classification benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages (9 pages of main text, 4 pages of references, and 14 pages of appendix), 13 figures, and 7 Tables</p></details> |

However, directly training LLMs with long context windows is insufficient to enhance this capability since some training samples do not exhibit strong semantic dependencies across long contexts. In this study, we propose a data mining framework \textbf{ProLong} that can assign each training sample with a long dependency score, which can be used to rank and filter samples that are more advantageous for enhancing long-context modeling abilities in LLM training. Specifically, we first use delta perplexity scores to measure the \textit{Dependency Strength} between text segments in a given document. Then we refine this metric based on the \textit{Dependency Distance} of these segments to incorporate spatial relationships across long-contexts. Final results are calibrated with a \textit{Dependency Specificity} metric to prevent trivial dependencies introduced by repetitive patterns. Moreover, a random sampling approach is proposed to optimize the computational efficiency of ProLong. Comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks indicate that ProLong effectively identifies documents that carry long dependencies and LLMs trained on these documents exhibit significantly enhanced long-context modeling capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, ACL 2024</p></details> |
| **[White-box Multimodal Jailbreaks Against Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17894v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have underscored their superiority in various multimodal tasks. However, the adversarial robustness of VLMs has not been fully explored. Existing methods mainly assess robustness through unimodal adversarial attacks that perturb images, while assuming inherent resilience against text-based attacks. Different from existing attacks, in this work we propose a more comprehensive strategy that jointly attacks both text and image modalities to exploit a broader spectrum of vulnerability within VLMs. Specifically, we propose a dual optimization objective aimed at guiding the model to generate affirmative responses with high toxicity. Our attack method begins by optimizing an adversarial image prefix from random noise to generate diverse harmful responses in the absence of text input, thus imbuing the image with toxic semantics. Subsequently, an adversarial text suffix is integrated and co-optimized with the adversarial image prefix to maximize the probability of eliciting affirmative responses to various harmful instructions. The discovered adversarial image prefix and text suffix are collectively denoted as a Universal Master Key (UMK). When integrated into various malicious queries, UMK can circumvent the alignment defenses of VLMs and lead to the generation of objectionable content, known as jailbreaks. The experimental results demonstrate that our universal attack strategy can effectively jailbreak MiniGPT-4 with a 96% success rate, highlighting the vulnerability of VLMs and the urgent need for new alignment strategies.</p></details> |  |

Despite their widespread success, existing LLM agents are hindered by generating unreasonable experiment plans within this scenario. To this end, we present DS-Agent, a novel automatic framework that harnesses LLM agent and case-based reasoning (CBR). In the development stage, DS-Agent follows the CBR framework to structure an automatic iteration pipeline, which can flexibly capitalize on the expert knowledge from Kaggle, and facilitate consistent performance improvement through the feedback mechanism. Moreover, DS-Agent implements a low-resource deployment stage with a simplified CBR paradigm to adapt past successful solutions from the development stage for direct code generation, significantly reducing the demand on foundational capabilities of LLMs. Empirically, DS-Agent with GPT-4 achieves 100\% success rate in the development stage, while attaining 36\% improvement on average one pass rate across alternative LLMs in the deployment stage. In both stages, DS-Agent achieves the best rank in performance, costing \$1.60 and \$0.13 per run with GPT-4, respectively.

To this end, this paper proposes VoCoT, a multi-step Visually grounded object-centric Chain-of-Thought reasoning framework tailored for inference with LMMs. VoCoT is characterized by two key features: (1) object-centric reasoning paths that revolve around cross-modal shared object-level information, and (2) visually grounded representation of object concepts in a multi-modal interleaved and aligned manner, which effectively bridges the modality gap within LMMs during long-term generation. Additionally, we construct an instruction dataset to facilitate LMMs in adapting to reasoning with VoCoT. By introducing VoCoT into the prevalent open-source LMM architecture, we introduce VolCano. With only 7B parameters and limited input resolution, VolCano demonstrates excellent performance across various scenarios, surpassing SOTA models, including GPT-4V, in tasks requiring complex reasoning. Our code, data and model will be available at https://github.com/RupertLuo/VoCoT.</p></details> |  |
| **[I-LLM: Efficient Integer-Only Inference for Fully-Quantized Low-Bit Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17849v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training quantization (PTQ) serves as a potent technique to accelerate the inference of large language models (LLMs). Nonetheless, existing works still necessitate a considerable number of floating-point (FP) operations during inference, including additional quantization and de-quantization, as well as non-linear operators such as RMSNorm and Softmax. This limitation hinders the deployment of LLMs on the edge and cloud devices. In this paper, we identify the primary obstacle to integer-only quantization for LLMs lies in the large fluctuation of activations across channels and tokens in both linear and non-linear operations. To address this issue, we propose I-LLM, a novel integer-only fully-quantized PTQ framework tailored for LLMs. Specifically, (1) we develop Fully-Smooth Block-Reconstruction (FSBR) to aggressively smooth inter-channel variations of all activations and weights. (2) to alleviate degradation caused by inter-token variations, we introduce a novel approach called Dynamic Integer-only MatMul (DI-MatMul). This method enables dynamic quantization in full-integer matrix multiplication by dynamically quantizing the input and outputs with integer-only operations. (3) we design DI-ClippedSoftmax, DI-Exp, and DI-Normalization, which utilize bit shift to execute non-linear operators efficiently while maintaining accuracy. The experiment shows that our I-LLM achieves comparable accuracy to the FP baseline and outperforms non-integer quantization methods. For example, I-LLM can operate at W4A4 with negligible loss of accuracy. To our knowledge, we are the first to bridge the gap between integer-only quantization and LLMs. We've published our code on anonymous.4open.science, aiming to contribute to the advancement of this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Large Language Models Mirror Cognitive Language Processing?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18023v2)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in text comprehension and logical reasoning, indicating that the text representations learned by LLMs can facilitate their language processing capabilities. In cognitive science, brain cognitive processing signals are typically utilized to study human language processing. Therefore, it is natural to ask how well the text embeddings from LLMs align with the brain cognitive processing signals, and how training strategies affect the LLM-brain alignment? In this paper, we employ Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to measure the alignment between 23 mainstream LLMs and fMRI signals of the brain to evaluate how effectively LLMs simulate cognitive language processing. We empirically investigate the impact of various factors (e.g., pre-training data size, model scaling, alignment training, and prompts) on such LLM-brain alignment. Experimental results indicate that pre-training data size and model scaling are positively correlated with LLM-brain similarity, and alignment training can significantly improve LLM-brain similarity. Explicit prompts contribute to the consistency of LLMs with brain cognitive language processing, while nonsensical noisy prompts may attenuate such alignment. Additionally, the performance of a wide range of LLM evaluations (e.g., MMLU, Chatbot Arena) is highly correlated with the LLM-brain similarity.</p></details> |  |

However, a key limitation persists in their lack of human-like memory faculties. LLMs exhibit constrained memory retention across sequential interactions, hindering complex reasoning. This paper explores the potential of applying cognitive psychology's working memory frameworks, to enhance LLM architecture. The limitations of traditional LLM memory designs are analyzed, including their isolation of distinct dialog episodes and lack of persistent memory links. To address this, an innovative model is proposed incorporating a centralized Working Memory Hub and Episodic Buffer access to retain memories across episodes. This architecture aims to provide greater continuity for nuanced contextual reasoning during intricate tasks and collaborative scenarios. While promising, further research is required into optimizing episodic memory encoding, storage, prioritization, retrieval, and security. Overall, this paper provides a strategic blueprint for developing LLM agents with more sophisticated, human-like memory capabilities, highlighting memory mechanisms as a vital frontier in artificial general intelligence.</p></details> |  |

However, they are often plagued by a loss of fine details and long rendering durations. 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently been introduced as a potent alternative, achieving both high-fidelity visual results and accelerated rendering performance. Nonetheless, scaling 3D Gaussian Splatting is fraught with challenges. Specifically, large-scale scenes grapples with the integration of objects across multiple scales and disparate viewpoints, which often leads to compromised efficacy as the Gaussians need to balance between detail levels. Furthermore, the generation of initialization points via COLMAP from large-scale dataset is both computationally demanding and prone to incomplete reconstructions. To address these challenges, we present Pyramidal 3D Gaussian Splatting (PyGS) with NeRF Initialization. Our approach represent the scene with a hierarchical assembly of Gaussians arranged in a pyramidal fashion. The top level of the pyramid is composed of a few large Gaussians, while each subsequent layer accommodates a denser collection of smaller Gaussians. We effectively initialize these pyramidal Gaussians through sampling a rapidly trained grid-based NeRF at various frequencies. We group these pyramidal Gaussians into clusters and use a compact weighting network to dynamically determine the influence of each pyramid level of each cluster considering camera viewpoint during rendering. Our method achieves a significant performance leap across multiple large-scale datasets and attains a rendering time that is over 400 times faster than current state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

We aim to measure the risks in finetuning LLMs through navigating the LLM safety landscape. We discover a new phenomenon observed universally in the model parameter space of popular open-source LLMs, termed as "safety basin": randomly perturbing model weights maintains the safety level of the original aligned model in its local neighborhood. Our discovery inspires us to propose the new VISAGE safety metric that measures the safety in LLM finetuning by probing its safety landscape. Visualizing the safety landscape of the aligned model enables us to understand how finetuning compromises safety by dragging the model away from the safety basin. LLM safety landscape also highlights the system prompt's critical role in protecting a model, and that such protection transfers to its perturbed variants within the safety basin. These observations from our safety landscape research provide new insights for future work on LLM safety community.</p></details> |  |

We found that tokens receiving lower attention weights often hold essential information for identifying nuanced object details -- ranging from merely recognizing object existence to identifying their attributes (color, position, etc.) and understanding their relationships. To counteract the over-emphasis on blind tokens and to accurately respond to user queries, we introduce a technique called Attentional Vision Calibration (AVC). During the decoding phase, AVC identifies blind tokens by analyzing the image-related attention distribution. It then dynamically adjusts the logits for the next token prediction by contrasting the logits conditioned on the original visual tokens with those conditioned on the blind tokens. This effectively lowers the dependency on blind tokens and promotes a more balanced consideration of all tokens. We validate AVC on benchmarks such as POPE, MME, and AMBER, where it consistently outperforms existing decoding techniques in mitigating object hallucinations in LVLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sangminwoo.github.io/AvisC/</p></details> |

Existing LLM serving systems are stateless across requests. Consequently, when LLMs are used in the common setting of multi-turn conversations, a growing log of the conversation history must be processed alongside any request by the serving system at each turn, resulting in repeated processing. In this paper, we design Pensieve, a system optimized for multi-turn conversation LLM serving. Pensieve maintains the conversation state across requests by caching previously processed history to avoid duplicate processing. Pensieve's multi-tier caching strategy can utilize both GPU and CPU memory to efficiently store and retrieve cached data. Pensieve also generalizes the recent PagedAttention kernel to support attention between multiple input tokens with a GPU cache spread over non-contiguous memory. Our evaluation shows that Pensieve can achieve 13-58% more throughput compared to vLLM and TensorRT-LLM and significantly reduce latency.</p></details> |  |

However, in the domain of reasoning tasks, we discover a frailty: LLMs are surprisingly brittle to the ordering of the premises, despite the fact that such ordering does not alter the underlying task. In particular, we observe that LLMs achieve the best performance when the premise order aligns with the context required in intermediate reasoning steps. For example, in deductive reasoning tasks, presenting the premises in the same order as the ground truth proof in the prompt (as opposed to random ordering) drastically increases the model's accuracy. We first examine the effect of premise ordering on deductive reasoning on a variety of LLMs, and our evaluation shows that permuting the premise order can cause a performance drop of over 30%. In addition, we release the benchmark R-GSM, based on GSM8K, to examine the ordering effect for mathematical problem-solving, and we again observe a significant drop in accuracy, relative to the original GSM8K benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICML 2024.

Despite its importance, the vision-language connector has been relatively less explored. In this study, we aim to propose a strong vision-language connector that enables MLLMs to achieve high accuracy while maintain low computation cost. We first reveal the existence of the visual anchors in Vision Transformer and propose a cost-effective search algorithm to extract them. Building on these findings, we introduce the Anchor Former (AcFormer), a novel vision-language connector designed to leverage the rich prior knowledge obtained from these visual anchors during pretraining, guiding the aggregation of information. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces computational costs by nearly two-thirds compared with baseline, while simultaneously outperforming baseline methods. This highlights the effectiveness and efficiency of AcFormer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Analytic Exemplar-Free Continual Learning with Large Models for Imbalanced Autonomous Driving Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17779v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of autonomous driving, even a meticulously trained model can encounter failures when faced with unfamiliar sceanrios. One of these scenarios can be formulated as an online continual learning (OCL) problem. That is, data come in an online fashion, and models are updated according to these streaming data. Two major OCL challenges are catastrophic forgetting and data imbalance. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an Analytic Exemplar-Free Online Continual Learning (AEF-OCL). The AEF-OCL leverages analytic continual learning principles and employs ridge regression as a classifier for features extracted by a large backbone network. It solves the OCL problem by recursively calculating the analytical solution, ensuring an equalization between the continual learning and its joint-learning counterpart, and works without the need to save any used samples (i.e., exemplar-free). Additionally, we introduce a Pseudo-Features Generator (PFG) module that recursively estimates the deviation of real features. The PFG generates offset pseudo-features following a normal distribution, thereby addressing the data imbalance issue.

This study addresses two such biases within LLMs: representative bias, which denotes a tendency of LLMs to generate outputs that mirror the experiences of certain identity groups, and affinity bias, reflecting the models' evaluative preferences for specific narratives or viewpoints. We introduce two novel metrics to measure these biases: the Representative Bias Score (RBS) and the Affinity Bias Score (ABS), and present the Creativity-Oriented Generation Suite (CoGS), a collection of open-ended tasks such as short story writing and poetry composition, designed with customized rubrics to detect these subtle biases. Our analysis uncovers marked representative biases in prominent LLMs, with a preference for identities associated with being white, straight, and men. Furthermore, our investigation of affinity bias reveals distinctive evaluative patterns within each model, akin to `bias fingerprints'. This trend is also seen in human evaluators, highlighting a complex interplay between human and machine bias perceptions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages (excluding references), accepted to ACL 2024 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[Linguistic Collapse: Neural Collapse in (Large) Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17767v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural collapse ($\mathcal{NC}$) is a phenomenon observed in classification tasks where top-layer representations collapse into their class means, which become equinorm, equiangular and aligned with the classifiers. These behaviors -- associated with generalization and robustness -- would manifest under specific conditions: models are trained towards zero loss, with noise-free labels belonging to balanced classes, which do not outnumber the model's hidden dimension. Recent studies have explored $\mathcal{NC}$ in the absence of one or more of these conditions to extend and capitalize on the associated benefits of ideal geometries. Language modeling presents a curious frontier, as \textit{training by token prediction} constitutes a classification task where none of the conditions exist: the vocabulary is imbalanced and exceeds the embedding dimension; different tokens might correspond to similar contextual embeddings; and large language models (LLMs) in particular are typically only trained for a few epochs. This paper empirically investigates the impact of scaling the architectures and training of causal language models (CLMs) on their progression towards $\mathcal{NC}$. We find that $\mathcal{NC}$ properties that develop with scaling are linked to generalization. Moreover, there is evidence of some relationship between $\mathcal{NC}$ and generalization independent of scale. Our work therefore underscores the generality of $\mathcal{NC}$ as it extends to the novel and more challenging setting of language modeling. Downstream, we seek to inspire further research on the phenomenon to deepen our understanding of LLMs -- and neural networks at large -- and improve existing architectures based on $\mathcal{NC}$-related properties.</p></details> | 29 pages, 27 figures |

This process includes queries and candidate passages in the prompts, utilizing pointwise, listwise, and pairwise prompting strategies. A limitation of these ranking strategies with LLMs is their cost: the process can become expensive due to API charges, which are based on the number of input and output tokens. We study how to maximize the re-ranking performance given a budget, by navigating the vast search spaces of prompt choices, LLM APIs, and budget splits. We propose a suite of budget-constrained methods to perform text re-ranking using a set of LLM APIs. Our most efficient method, called EcoRank, is a two-layered pipeline that jointly optimizes decisions regarding budget allocation across prompt strategies and LLM APIs. Our experimental results on four popular QA and passage reranking datasets show that EcoRank outperforms other budget-aware supervised and unsupervised baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Findings of ACL 24</p></details> |

While previous works have already achieved 3D human motion generation using various approaches including language modeling, they mostly % are mostly carefully designed use specialized architecture and are restricted to single-human motion generation. Inspired by the success of MM-LLMs, we propose MotionLLM, a simple and general framework that can achieve single-human, multi-human motion generation, and motion captioning by fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs. Specifically, we encode and quantize motions into discrete LLM-understandable tokens, which results in a unified vocabulary consisting of both motion and text tokens. With only 1--3% parameters of the LLMs trained by using adapters, our single-human motion generation achieves comparable results to those diffusion models and other trained-from-scratch transformer-based models. Additionally, we show that our approach is scalable and flexible, allowing easy extension to multi-human motion generation through autoregressive generation of single-human motions.

Despite advancements in visual grounding models, their ability to comprehend complex queries remains limited. To overcome this limitation, we introduce LLM-Optic, an innovative method that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) as an optical lens to enhance existing visual grounding models in comprehending complex text queries involving intricate text structures, multiple objects, or object spatial relationships, situations that current models struggle with. LLM-Optic first employs an LLM as a Text Grounder to interpret complex text queries and accurately identify objects the user intends to locate. Then a pre-trained visual grounding model is used to generate candidate bounding boxes given the refined query by the Text Grounder. After that, LLM-Optic annotates the candidate bounding boxes with numerical marks to establish a connection between text and specific image regions, thereby linking two distinct modalities. Finally, it employs a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) as a Visual Grounder to select the marked candidate objects that best correspond to the original text query. Through LLM-Optic, we have achieved universal visual grounding, which allows for the detection of arbitrary objects specified by arbitrary human language input. Importantly, our method achieves this enhancement without requiring additional training or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across various challenging benchmarks demonstrate that LLM-Optic achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot visual grounding capabilities.

However, current methodologies heavily rely on prompt engineering (e.g., multi-agent cooperation) with proprietary LLMs, raising data privacy concerns that could be prohibitive in industry applications. To tackle this issue, we propose training open-source LLMs for optimization modeling. We identify four critical requirements for the training dataset of OR LLMs, design and implement OR-Instruct, a semi-automated process for creating synthetic data tailored to specific requirements. We also introduce the IndustryOR benchmark, the first industrial benchmark for testing LLMs on solving real-world OR problems. We apply the data from OR-Instruct to various open-source LLMs of 7b size (termed as ORLMs), resulting in a significantly improved capability for optimization modeling. Our best-performing ORLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NL4OPT, MAMO, and IndustryOR benchmarks.

Recently, researchers have attempted to leverage the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for CCU by capitalizing on their remarkable comprehension and semantic capabilities. However, no comprehensive benchmark is available to assess the CCU capabilities of LLMs. To fill this gap, this paper introduces C$^{3}$bench, a Comprehensive Classical Chinese understanding benchmark, which comprises 50,000 text pairs for five primary CCU tasks, including classification, retrieval, named entity recognition, punctuation, and translation. Furthermore, the data in C$^{3}$bench originates from ten different domains, covering most of the categories in classical Chinese. Leveraging the proposed C$^{3}$bench, we extensively evaluate the quantitative performance of 15 representative LLMs on all five CCU tasks. Our results not only establish a public leaderboard of LLMs' CCU capabilities but also gain some findings. Specifically, existing LLMs are struggle with CCU tasks and still inferior to supervised models. Additionally, the results indicate that CCU is a task that requires special attention. We believe this study could provide a standard benchmark, comprehensive baselines, and valuable insights for the future advancement of LLM-based CCU research.

Unlike traditional imputation methods, which predominantly rely on numerical estimations, CLAIM utilizes contextually relevant natural language descriptors to fill missing values. This approach transforms datasets into natural language contextualized formats that are inherently more aligned with LLMs' capabilities, thereby facilitating the dual use of LLMs: first, to generate missing value descriptors, and then, to fine-tune the LLM on the enriched dataset for improved performance in downstream tasks. Our evaluations across diverse datasets and missingness patterns reveal CLAIM's superior performance over existing imputation techniques. Furthermore, our investigation into the effectiveness of context-specific versus generic descriptors for missing data highlights the importance of contextual accuracy in enhancing LLM performance for data imputation. The results underscore CLAIM's potential to markedly improve the reliability and quality of data analysis and machine learning models, offering a more nuanced and effective solution for handling missing data.</p></details> |  |

The foundational idea of our research is that the communication based on semantics and the generation of meaningful textual data are directly linked, and we posit that these processes are equivalent if the exchanged information can be serialized in text form. Based on this, we construct a "semantic node" data structure in our research to capture the semantic essence of textual data. Then, a system powered by large language models is designed and implemented to process the "semantic node" and generate standardized digital twin models from raw textual data collected from datasheets describing technical assets. Our evaluation demonstrates an effective generation rate of 62-79%, indicating a substantial proportion of the information from the source text can be translated error-free to the target digital twin instance model with the generative capability of large language models. This result has a direct application in the context of Industry 4.0, and the designed system is implemented as a data model generation tool for reducing the manual effort in creating AAS model. In our evaluation, a comparative analysis of different LLMs and an in-depth ablation study of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanisms provide insights into the effectiveness of LLM systems for interpreting technical concepts and translating data. Our findings emphasize LLMs' capability to automate AAS instance creation and contribute to the broader field of semantic interoperability for digital twins in industrial applications.

Under the assumption that the predicted state of a large eddy simulation prediction must be close to that of a subsampled direct numerical simulation, we retrieve an upper bound for the prediction error when utilizing a data-driven closure model. We also demonstrate that this error is significantly affected by the time step size and the Jacobian which play a role in amplifying the initial one-step error made by using the closure. Our analysis also shows that the error propagates exponentially with rollout time and the upper bound of the system Jacobian which is itself influenced by the Jacobian of the closure formulation. These findings could enable the development of new regularization techniques for ML models based on the identified error-bound terms, improving their robustness and reducing error propagation.</p></details> |  |

Despite these developments, applications in understanding 3D environments remain limited. This paper introduces Reason3D, a novel LLM designed for comprehensive 3D understanding. Reason3D takes point cloud data and text prompts as input to produce textual responses and segmentation masks, facilitating advanced tasks like 3D reasoning segmentation, hierarchical searching, express referring, and question answering with detailed mask outputs. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical mask decoder to locate small objects within expansive scenes. This decoder initially generates a coarse location estimate covering the object's general area. This foundational estimation facilitates a detailed, coarse-to-fine segmentation strategy that significantly enhances the precision of object identification and segmentation.

Despite recent large language model (LLM) based agents achieving promising performance, they still exhibit several limitations. For instance, the output of LLMs is a descriptive sentence, which is ambiguous when determining specific actions. To address these limitations, we introduce the large auto-regressive model (LARM). LARM leverages both text and multi-view images as input and predicts subsequent actions in an auto-regressive manner. To train LARM, we develop a novel data format named auto-regressive node transmission structure and assemble a corresponding dataset. Adopting a two-phase training regimen, LARM successfully harvests enchanted equipment in Minecraft, which demands significantly more complex decision-making chains than the highest achievements of prior best methods. Besides, the speed of LARM is 6.8x faster.</p></details> |  |

Hence, the capability to automatically detect and self-correct failure action is essential for a practical robotic system. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in visual instruction following and demonstrated strong reasoning abilities in various tasks. To unleash general MLLMs as an end-to-end robotic agent, we introduce a Self-Corrected (SC)-MLLM, equipping our model not only to predict end-effector poses but also to autonomously recognize and correct failure actions. Specifically, we first conduct parameter-efficient fine-tuning to empower MLLM with pose prediction ability, which is reframed as a language modeling problem. When facing execution failures, our model learns to identify low-level action error causes (i.e., position and rotation errors) and adaptively seeks prompt feedback from experts. Based on the feedback, SC-MLLM rethinks the current failure scene and generates the corrected actions. Furthermore, we design a continuous policy learning method for successfully corrected samples, enhancing the model's adaptability to the current scene configuration and reducing the frequency of expert intervention. To evaluate our SC-MLLM, we conduct extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings. SC-MLLM agent significantly improve manipulation accuracy compared to previous state-of-the-art robotic MLLM (ManipLLM), increasing from 57\% to 79\% on seen object categories and from 47\% to 69\% on unseen novel categories.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, there remains to be a significant gap in benchmarks that accurately reflect the complexity of real-world RTL projects. To address this, this paper presents RTL-Repo, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on large-scale RTL design projects. RTL-Repo includes a comprehensive dataset of more than 4000 Verilog code samples extracted from public GitHub repositories, with each sample providing the full context of the corresponding repository. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models on the RTL-Repo benchmark, including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Starcoder2, alongside Verilog-specific models like VeriGen and RTLCoder, and compare their performance in generating Verilog code for complex projects. The RTL-Repo benchmark provides a valuable resource for the hardware design community to assess and compare LLMs' performance in real-world RTL design scenarios and train LLMs specifically for Verilog code generation in complex, multi-file RTL projects.

This study proposes a comprehensive comparative analysis of the most advanced LLMs to assess their moral profiles. We subjected several state-of-the-art models to a selection of ethical dilemmas and found that all the proprietary ones are mostly utilitarian and all of the open-weights ones align mostly with values-based ethics. Furthermore, when using the Moral Foundations Questionnaire, all models we probed - except for Llama 2- displayed a strong liberal bias. Lastly, in order to causally intervene in one of the studied models, we propose a novel similarity-specific activation steering technique. Using this method, we were able to reliably steer the model's moral compass to different ethical schools. All of these results showcase that there is an ethical dimension in already deployed LLMs, an aspect that is generally overlooked.</p></details> |  |

Large language models (LLMs) bring opportunities to KBQA, while their costs are significantly higher and absence of domain-specific knowledge during pre-training. We are motivated to combine LLMs and prior small models on knowledge graphs (KGMs) for both inferential accuracy and cost saving. However, it remains challenging since accuracy and cost are not readily combined in the optimization as two distinct metrics. It is also laborious for model selection since different models excel in diverse knowledge. To this end, we propose Coke, a novel cost-efficient strategy for KBQA with LLMs, modeled as a tailored multi-armed bandit problem to minimize calls to LLMs within limited budgets. We first formulate the accuracy expectation with a cluster-level Thompson Sampling for either KGMs or LLMs. A context-aware policy is optimized to further distinguish the expert model subject to the question semantics. The overall decision is bounded by the cost regret according to historical expenditure on failures. Extensive experiments showcase the superior performance of Coke, which moves the Pareto frontier with up to 20.89% saving of GPT-4 fees while achieving a 2.74% higher accuracy on the benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |

As a prevalent property of the models using the ReLU activation function, activation sparsity has been proven a promising paradigm to boost model inference efficiency. Nevertheless, most large language models (LLMs) adopt activation functions without intrinsic activation sparsity (e.g., GELU and Swish). Some recent efforts have explored introducing ReLU or its variants as the substitutive activation function to help LLMs achieve activation sparsity and inference acceleration, but few can simultaneously obtain high sparsity and comparable model performance. This paper introduces a simple and effective sparsification method named "ProSparse" to push LLMs for higher activation sparsity while maintaining comparable performance. Specifically, after substituting the activation function of LLMs with ReLU, ProSparse adopts progressive sparsity regularization with a factor smoothly increasing along the multi-stage sine curves. This can enhance activation sparsity and mitigate performance degradation by avoiding radical shifts in activation distributions. With ProSparse, we obtain high sparsity of 89.32% for LLaMA2-7B, 88.80% for LLaMA2-13B, and 87.89% for end-size MiniCPM-1B, respectively, achieving comparable performance to their original Swish-activated versions. These present the most sparsely activated models among open-source LLaMA versions and competitive end-size models, considerably surpassing ReluLLaMA-7B (66.98%) and ReluLLaMA-13B (71.56%). Our inference acceleration experiments further demonstrate the significant practical acceleration potential of LLMs with higher activation sparsity, obtaining up to 4.52$\times$ inference speedup.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 4 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

Recently, open-source LLVMs have curated high-quality visual instruction tuning datasets and utilized additional vision encoders or multiple computer vision models in order to narrow the performance gap with powerful closed-source LLVMs. These advancements are attributed to multifaceted information required for diverse capabilities, including fundamental image understanding, real-world knowledge about common-sense and non-object concepts (e.g., charts, diagrams, symbols, signs, and math problems), and step-by-step procedures for solving complex questions. Drawing from the multifaceted information, we present a new efficient LLVM, Mamba-based traversal of rationales (Meteor), which leverages multifaceted rationale to enhance understanding and answering capabilities. To embed lengthy rationales containing abundant information, we employ the Mamba architecture, capable of processing sequential data with linear time complexity. We introduce a new concept of traversal of rationale that facilitates efficient embedding of rationale. Subsequently, the backbone multimodal language model (MLM) is trained to generate answers with the aid of rationale. Through these steps, Meteor achieves significant improvements in vision language performances across multiple evaluation benchmarks requiring diverse capabilities, without scaling up the model size or employing additional vision encoders and computer vision models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available in https://github.com/ByungKwanLee/Meteor</p></details> |

Our investigation navigates the intriguing terrain of whether LLMs, despite their non-embodied nature, effectively capture implicit human intuitions about fundamental, spatial building blocks of language. We employ insights from spatial cognitive foundations developed through early sensorimotor experiences, guiding our exploration through the reproduction of three psycholinguistic experiments. Surprisingly, correlations between model outputs and human responses emerge, revealing adaptability without a tangible connection to embodied experiences. Notable distinctions include polarized language model responses and reduced correlations in vision language models.

However, LLM-based agents lack specialization in tackling specific target problems, particularly in real-time dynamic environments. Additionally, deploying an LLM-based agent in practical scenarios can be both costly and time-consuming. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) approaches train agents that specialize in the target task but often suffer from low sampling efficiency and high exploration costs. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that addresses these challenges by training a smaller, specialized student RL agent using instructions from an LLM-based teacher agent. By incorporating the guidance from the teacher agent, the student agent can distill the prior knowledge of the LLM into its own model. Consequently, the student agent can be trained with significantly less data. Moreover, through further training with environment feedback, the student agent surpasses the capabilities of its teacher for completing the target task. We conducted experiments on challenging MiniGrid and Habitat environments, specifically designed for embodied AI research, to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework. The results clearly demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to strong baseline methods.

We participated in the Explainability of Cross-lingual Emotion Detection (EXALT) shared task, achieving an F1-score of 0.6046 on the evaluation set for the emotion detection sub-task. Our system outperformed the baseline by more than 0.16 F1-score absolute, and ranked second amongst competing systems. We conducted experiments using fine-tuning, zero-shot learning, and few-shot learning for Large Language Model (LLM)-based models as well as embedding-based BiLSTM and KNN for non-LLM-based techniques. Additionally, we introduced two novel methods: the Multi-Iteration Agentic Workflow and the Multi-Binary-Classifier Agentic Workflow. We found that LLM-based approaches provided good performance on multilingual emotion detection. Furthermore, ensembles combining all our experimented models yielded higher F1-scores than any single approach alone.</p></details> | <details><summary>(Unde...</summary><p>(Under review) Proceedings of the 13th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment, & Social Media Analysis</p></details> |
| **[FinRobot: An Open-Source AI Agent Platform for Financial Applications using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14767v2)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As financial institutions and professionals increasingly incorporate Large Language Models (LLMs) into their workflows, substantial barriers, including proprietary data and specialized knowledge, persist between the finance sector and the AI community. These challenges impede the AI community's ability to enhance financial tasks effectively. Acknowledging financial analysis's critical role, we aim to devise financial-specialized LLM-based toolchains and democratize access to them through open-source initiatives, promoting wider AI adoption in financial decision-making. In this paper, we introduce FinRobot, a novel open-source AI agent platform supporting multiple financially specialized AI agents, each powered by LLM. Specifically, the platform consists of four major layers: 1) the Financial AI Agents layer that formulates Financial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) by breaking sophisticated financial problems down into logical sequences; 2) the Financial LLM Algorithms layer dynamically configures appropriate model application strategies for specific tasks; 3) the LLMOps and DataOps layer produces accurate models by applying training/fine-tuning techniques and using task-relevant data; 4) the Multi-source LLM Foundation Models layer that integrates various LLMs and enables the above layers to access them directly. Finally, FinRobot provides hands-on for both professional-grade analysts and laypersons to utilize powerful AI techniques for advanced financial analysis. We open-source FinRobot at \url{https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinRobot}.</p></details> | <details><summary>FinRo...</summary><p>FinRobot Whitepaper V1.0</p></details> |
| **[Guiding Enumerative Program Synthesis with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03997v2)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) are beginning to dominate the discourse around automatic code generation with natural language specifications. In contrast, the best-performing synthesizers in the domain of formal synthesis with precise logical specifications are still based on enumerative algorithms. In this paper, we evaluate the abilities of LLMs to solve formal synthesis benchmarks by carefully crafting a library of prompts for the domain. When one-shot synthesis fails, we propose a novel enumerative synthesis algorithm, which integrates calls to an LLM into a weighted probabilistic search. This allows the synthesizer to provide the LLM with information about the progress of the enumerator, and the LLM to provide the enumerator with syntactic guidance in an iterative loop. We evaluate our techniques on benchmarks from the Syntax-Guided Synthesis (SyGuS) competition. We find that GPT-3.5 as a stand-alone tool for formal synthesis is easily outperformed by state-of-the-art formal synthesis algorithms, but our approach integrating the LLM into an enumerative synthesis algorithm shows significant performance gains over both the LLM and the enumerative synthesizer alone and the winning SyGuS competition tool.</p></details> | Accepted at CAV 2024 |
| **[Phase Transitions in the Output Distribution of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17088v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a physical system, changing parameters such as temperature can induce a phase transition: an abrupt change from one state of matter to another. Analogous phenomena have recently been observed in large language models. Typically, the task of identifying phase transitions requires human analysis and some prior understanding of the system to narrow down which low-dimensional properties to monitor and analyze. Statistical methods for the automated detection of phase transitions from data have recently been proposed within the physics community. These methods are largely system agnostic and, as shown here, can be adapted to study the behavior of large language models. In particular, we quantify distributional changes in the generated output via statistical distances, which can be efficiently estimated with access to the probability distribution over next-tokens. This versatile approach is capable of discovering new phases of behavior and unexplored transitions -- an ability that is particularly exciting in light of the rapid development of language models and their emergent capabilities.</p></details> | 21 pages, 4 figures |

The reliable detection of such hallucinations in MLLMs has, therefore, become a vital aspect of model evaluation and the safeguarding of practical application deployment. Prior research in this domain has been constrained by a narrow focus on singular tasks, an inadequate range of hallucination categories addressed, and a lack of detailed granularity. In response to these challenges, our work expands the investigative horizons of hallucination detection. We present a novel meta-evaluation benchmark, MHaluBench, meticulously crafted to facilitate the evaluation of advancements in hallucination detection methods. Additionally, we unveil a novel unified multimodal hallucination detection framework, UNIHD, which leverages a suite of auxiliary tools to validate the occurrence of hallucinations robustly. We demonstrate the effectiveness of UNIHD through meticulous evaluation and comprehensive analysis. We also provide strategic insights on the application of specific tools for addressing various categories of hallucinations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2024 (main conference)</p></details> |

Degrading Large Language Models through Challenging Their Tokenization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17067v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in language understanding and generation. Nonetheless, it was also witnessed that LLMs tend to produce inaccurate responses to specific queries. This deficiency can be traced to the tokenization step LLMs must undergo, which is an inevitable limitation inherent to all LLMs. In fact, incorrect tokenization is the critical point that hinders LLMs in understanding the input precisely, thus leading to unsatisfactory output. To demonstrate this flaw of LLMs, we construct an adversarial dataset, named as $\textbf{ADT (Adversarial Dataset for Tokenizer)}$, which draws upon the vocabularies of various open-source LLMs to challenge LLMs' tokenization. ADT consists of two subsets: the manually constructed ADT-Human and the automatically generated ADT-Auto. Our empirical results reveal that our ADT is highly effective on challenging the tokenization of leading LLMs, including GPT-4o, Llama-3, Qwen2.5-max and so on, thus degrading these LLMs' capabilities. Moreover, our method of automatic data generation has been proven efficient and robust, which can be applied to any open-source LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to investigating LLMs' vulnerability in terms of challenging their token segmentation, which will shed light on the subsequent research of improving LLMs' capabilities through optimizing their tokenization process and algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figures, this paper is submitted to neurips 2024</p></details> |

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their potential to revolutionize wireless communication systems. However, existing studies on LLMs for wireless systems are limited to a direct application for telecom language understanding. To empower LLMs with knowledge and expertise in the wireless domain, this paper proposes WirelessLLM, a comprehensive framework for adapting and enhancing LLMs to address the unique challenges and requirements of wireless communication networks. We first identify three foundational principles that underpin WirelessLLM: knowledge alignment, knowledge fusion, and knowledge evolution. Then, we investigate the enabling technologies to build WirelessLLM, including prompt engineering, retrieval augmented generation, tool usage, multi-modal pre-training, and domain-specific fine-tuning. Moreover, we present three case studies to demonstrate the practical applicability and benefits of WirelessLLM for solving typical problems in wireless networks. Finally, we conclude this paper by highlighting key challenges and outlining potential avenues for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[SelfCP: Compressing Long Prompt to 1/12 Using the Frozen Large Language Model Itself](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17052v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long prompt leads to huge hardware costs when using Large Language Models (LLMs). Unfortunately, many tasks, such as summarization, inevitably introduce long task-inputs, and the wide application of in-context learning easily makes the prompt length explode. Inspired by the language understanding ability of LLMs, this paper proposes SelfCP, which uses the LLM \textbf{itself} to \textbf{C}ompress long \textbf{P}rompt into compact virtual tokens. SelfCP applies a general frozen LLM twice, first as an encoder to compress the prompt and then as a decoder to generate responses. Specifically, given a long prompt, we place special tokens within the lengthy segment for compression and signal the LLM to generate $k$ virtual tokens. Afterward, the virtual tokens concatenate with the uncompressed prompt and are fed into the same LLM to generate the response. In general, SelfCP facilitates the unconditional and conditional compression of prompts, fitting both standard tasks and those with specific objectives. Since the encoder and decoder are frozen, SelfCP only contains 17M trainable parameters and allows for convenient adaptation across various backbones. We implement SelfCP with two LLM backbones and evaluate it in both in- and out-domain tasks. Results show that the compressed virtual tokens can substitute $12 \times$ larger original prompts effectively</p></details> |  |

However, how interesting are these AI-generated ideas, and how can we improve their quality? Here, we introduce SciMuse, a system that uses an evolving knowledge graph built from more than 58 million scientific papers to generate personalized research ideas via an interface to GPT-4. We conducted a large-scale human evaluation with over 100 research group leaders from the Max Planck Society, who ranked more than 4,000 personalized research ideas based on their level of interest. This evaluation allows us to understand the relationships between scientific interest and the core properties of the knowledge graph. We find that data-efficient machine learning can predict research interest with high precision, allowing us to optimize the interest-level of generated research ideas. This work represents a step towards an artificial scientific muse that could catalyze unforeseen collaborations and suggest interesting avenues for scientists.</p></details> | 10 pages; 5 figures |

| **[Empowering Large Language Models to Set up a Knowledge Retrieval Indexer via Self-Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16933v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a cost-effective approach to injecting real-time knowledge into large language models (LLMs). Nevertheless, constructing and validating high-quality knowledge repositories require considerable effort. We propose a pre-retrieval framework named Pseudo-Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (PG-RAG), which conceptualizes LLMs as students by providing them with abundant raw reading materials and encouraging them to engage in autonomous reading to record factual information in their own words. The resulting concise, well-organized mental indices are interconnected through common topics or complementary facts to form a pseudo-graph database. During the retrieval phase, PG-RAG mimics the human behavior in flipping through notes, identifying fact paths and subsequently exploring the related contexts. Adhering to the principle of the path taken by many is the best, it integrates highly corroborated fact paths to provide a structured and refined sub-graph assisting LLMs. We validated PG-RAG on three specialized question-answering datasets. In single-document tasks, PG-RAG significantly outperformed the current best baseline, KGP-LLaMA, across all key evaluation metrics, with an average overall performance improvement of 11.6%. Specifically, its BLEU score increased by approximately 14.3%, and the QE-F1 metric improved by 23.7%. In multi-document scenarios, the average metrics of PG-RAG were at least 2.35% higher than the best baseline. Notably, the BLEU score and QE-F1 metric showed stable improvements of around 7.55% and 12.75%, respectively. Our code: https://github.com/IAAR-Shanghai/PGRAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Faithfully Express Their Intrinsic Uncertainty in Words?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16908v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We posit that large language models (LLMs) should be capable of expressing their intrinsic uncertainty in natural language. For example, if the LLM is equally likely to output two contradicting answers to the same question, then its generated response should reflect this uncertainty by hedging its answer (e.g., "I'm not sure, but I think..."). We formalize faithful response uncertainty based on the gap between the model's intrinsic confidence in the assertions it makes and the decisiveness by which they are conveyed. This example-level metric reliably indicates whether the model reflects its uncertainty, as it penalizes both excessive and insufficient hedging. We evaluate a variety of aligned LLMs at faithfully communicating uncertainty on several knowledge-intensive question answering tasks. Our results provide strong evidence that modern LLMs are poor at faithfully conveying their uncertainty, and that better alignment is necessary to improve their trustworthiness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Machine Translation with Large Language Models: A Preliminary Study with Cooperative Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02851v2)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contemporary translation engines based on the encoder-decoder framework have made significant strides in development. However, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has disrupted their position by presenting the potential for achieving superior translation quality. To uncover the circumstances in which LLMs excel and explore how their strengths can be harnessed to enhance translation quality, we first conduct a comprehensive analysis to assess the strengths and limitations of various commercial NMT systems and MT-oriented LLMs. Our findings indicate that neither NMT nor MT-oriented LLMs alone can effectively address all the translation issues, but MT-oriented LLMs show promise as a complementary solution to NMT systems. Building upon these insights, we propose Cooperative Decoding (CoDec), which treats NMT systems as a pretranslation model and MT-oriented LLMs as a supplemental solution to handle complex scenarios beyond the capability of NMT alone. Experimental results on the WMT22 test sets and a newly collected test set WebCrawl demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CoDec, highlighting its potential as a robust solution for combining NMT systems with MT-oriented LLMs in the field of machine translation.</p></details> | ACL2024 findings |
| **[On Fairness of Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17512v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-rank adaptation of large models, particularly LoRA, has gained traction due to its computational efficiency. This efficiency, contrasted with the prohibitive costs of full-model fine-tuning, means that practitioners often turn to LoRA and sometimes without a complete understanding of its ramifications. In this study, we focus on fairness and ask whether LoRA has an unexamined impact on utility, calibration, and resistance to membership inference across different subgroups (e.g., genders, races, religions) compared to a full-model fine-tuning baseline. We present extensive experiments across vision and language domains and across classification and generation tasks using ViT-Base, Swin-v2-Large, Llama-2 7B, and Mistral 7B. Intriguingly, experiments suggest that while one can isolate cases where LoRA exacerbates model bias across subgroups, the pattern is inconsistent -- in many cases, LoRA has equivalent or even improved fairness compared to the base model or its full fine-tuning baseline. We also examine the complications of evaluating fine-tuning fairness relating to task design and model token bias, calling for more careful fairness evaluations in future work.</p></details> |  |

One of their common features, the extremely large-scale antenna array (ELAA) systems with hundreds or thousands of antennas, give rise to near-field (NF) propagation and bring new challenges to channel modeling and characterization. In this paper, a cross-field channel model for ELAA systems is proposed, which improves the statistical model in 3GPP TR 38.901 by refining the propagation path with its first and last bounces and differentiating the characterization of parameters like path loss, delay, and angles in near- and far-fields. A comprehensive analysis of cross-field boundaries and closed-form expressions of corresponding NF or FF parameters are provided. Furthermore, cross-field experiments carried out in a typical indoor scenario at 300 GHz verify the variation of MPC parameters across the antenna array, and demonstrate the distinction of channels between different antenna elements. Finally, detailed generation procedures of the cross-field channel model are provided, based on which simulations and analysis on NF probabilities and channel coefficients are conducted for $4\times4$, $8\times8$, $16\times16$, and $9\times21$ uniform planar arrays at different frequency bands.</p></details> | 14 pages, 33 figures |
| **[A Large Language Model-based multi-agent manufacturing system for intelligent shopfloor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16887v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As productivity advances, the demand of customers for multi-variety and small-batch production is increasing, thereby putting forward higher requirements for manufacturing systems. When production tasks frequent changes due to this demand, traditional manufacturing systems often cannot response promptly. The multi-agent manufacturing system is proposed to address this problem. However, because of technical limitations, the negotiation among agents in this kind of system is realized through predefined heuristic rules, which is not intelligent enough to deal with the multi-variety and small batch production. To this end, a Large Language Model-based (LLM-based) multi-agent manufacturing system for intelligent shopfloor is proposed in the present study. This system delineates the diverse agents and defines their collaborative methods. The roles of the agents encompass Machine Server Agent (MSA), Bid Inviter Agent (BIA), Bidder Agent (BA), Thinking Agent (TA), and Decision Agent (DA). Due to the support of LLMs, TA and DA acquire the ability of analyzing the shopfloor condition and choosing the most suitable machine, as opposed to executing a predefined program artificially. The negotiation between BAs and BIA is the most crucial step in connecting manufacturing resources. With the support of TA and DA, BIA will finalize the distribution of orders, relying on the information of each machine returned by BA. MSAs bears the responsibility for connecting the agents with the physical shopfloor. This system aims to distribute and transmit workpieces through the collaboration of the agents with these distinct roles, distinguishing it from other scheduling approaches. Comparative experiments were also conducted to validate the performance of this system.</p></details> |  |

An Investigation of Large Language Models for Entity Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16884v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Entity matching (EM) is a critical step in entity resolution. Recently, entity matching based on large language models (LLMs) has shown great promise. However, current LLM-based entity matching approaches typically follow a binary matching paradigm that ignores the global consistency between different records. In this paper, we investigate various methodologies for LLM-based entity matching that incorporate record interactions from different perspectives. Specifically, we comprehensively compare three representative strategies: matching, comparing, and selecting, and analyze their respective advantages and challenges in diverse scenarios. Based on our findings, we further design a compositional entity matching (ComEM) framework that leverages the composition of multiple strategies and LLMs. In this way, ComEM can benefit from the advantages of different sides and achieve improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency. Experimental results show that ComEM not only achieves significant performance gains on various datasets but also reduces the cost of LLM-based entity matching in real-world application.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under revision.

Current research primarily focuses on improving LLMs' cross-lingual generalization capabilities. However, there is still a lack of research on the intrinsic mechanisms of how LLMs achieve cross-lingual alignment. From the perspective of region partitioning, this paper conducts several investigations on the linguistic competence of LLMs. We discover a core region in LLMs that corresponds to linguistic competence, accounting for approximately 1% of the total model parameters. Removing this core region by setting parameters to zero results in a significant performance decrease across 30 different languages. Furthermore, this core region exhibits significant dimensional dependency, perturbations to even a single parameter on specific dimensions leading to a loss of linguistic competence. Moreover, we discover that distinct monolingual regions exist for different languages, and disruption to these specific regions substantially reduces the LLMs' proficiency in those corresponding languages. Our research also indicates that freezing the core linguistic region during further pre-training can mitigate the issue of catastrophic forgetting (CF), a common phenomenon observed during further pre-training of LLMs. Overall, exploring the LLMs' functional regions provides insights into the foundation of their intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2024.

| **[Safe LoRA: the Silver Lining of Reducing Safety Risks when Fine-tuning Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16833v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) such as Llama-2 or GPT-4 have shown impressive zero-shot performance, fine-tuning is still necessary to enhance their performance for customized datasets, domain-specific tasks, or other private needs. However, fine-tuning all parameters of LLMs requires significant hardware resources, which can be impractical for typical users. Therefore, parameter-efficient fine-tuning such as LoRA have emerged, allowing users to fine-tune LLMs without the need for considerable computing resources, with little performance degradation compared to fine-tuning all parameters. Unfortunately, recent studies indicate that fine-tuning can increase the risk to the safety of LLMs, even when data does not contain malicious content. To address this challenge, we propose Safe LoRA, a simple one-liner patch to the original LoRA implementation by introducing the projection of LoRA weights from selected layers to the safety-aligned subspace, effectively reducing the safety risks in LLM fine-tuning while maintaining utility. It is worth noting that Safe LoRA is a training-free and data-free approach, as it only requires the knowledge of the weights from the base and aligned LLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that when fine-tuning on purely malicious data, Safe LoRA retains similar safety performance as the original aligned model. Moreover, when the fine-tuning dataset contains a mixture of both benign and malicious data, Safe LoRA mitigates the negative effect made by malicious data while preserving performance on downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |

Though surprised by their excellent performances, researchers also noticed some special behaviors of those LLMs. One of those behaviors is memorization, in which LLMs can generate the same content used to train them. Though previous research has discussed memorization, the memorization of LLMs still lacks explanation, especially the cause of memorization and the dynamics of generating them. In this research, we comprehensively discussed memorization from various perspectives and extended the discussion scope to not only just the memorized content but also less and unmemorized content. Through various studies, we found that: (1) Through experiments, we revealed the relation of memorization between model size, continuation size, and context size. Further, we showed how unmemorized sentences transition to memorized sentences. (2) Through embedding analysis, we showed the distribution and decoding dynamics across model size in embedding space for sentences with different memorization scores. The n-gram statistics analysis presents d (3) An analysis over n-gram and entropy decoding dynamics discovered a boundary effect when the model starts to generate memorized sentences or unmemorized sentences. (4)We trained a Transformer model to predict the memorization of different models, showing that it is possible to predict memorizations by context.</p></details> |  |

Despite producing high-quality samples, existing methods are constrained to generating images of scenes at a limited scale. In this paper, we present MetaEarth, a generative foundation model that breaks the barrier by scaling image generation to a global level, exploring the creation of worldwide, multi-resolution, unbounded, and virtually limitless remote sensing images. In MetaEarth, we propose a resolution-guided self-cascading generative framework, which enables the generating of images at any region with a wide range of geographical resolutions. To achieve unbounded and arbitrary-sized image generation, we design a novel noise sampling strategy for denoising diffusion models by analyzing the generation conditions and initial noise. To train MetaEarth, we construct a large dataset comprising multi-resolution optical remote sensing images with geographical information. Experiments have demonstrated the powerful capabilities of our method in generating global-scale images. Additionally, the MetaEarth serves as a data engine that can provide high-quality and rich training data for downstream tasks. Our model opens up new possibilities for constructing generative world models by simulating Earth visuals from an innovative overhead perspective.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jiupinjia.github.io/metaearth/</p></details> |

Conventional approaches to decision making face challenges related to low sample efficiency and poor generalization. In contrast, foundation models in language and vision have showcased rapid adaptation to diverse new tasks. Therefore, we advocate for the construction of foundation agents as a transformative shift in the learning paradigm of agents. This proposal is underpinned by the formulation of foundation agents with their fundamental characteristics and challenges motivated by the success of large language models (LLMs). Moreover, we specify the roadmap of foundation agents from large interactive data collection or generation, to self-supervised pretraining and adaptation, and knowledge and value alignment with LLMs. Lastly, we pinpoint critical research questions derived from the formulation and delineate trends for foundation agents supported by real-world use cases, addressing both technical and theoretical aspects to propel the field towards a more comprehensive and impactful future.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 2 figures, camera-ready version of ICML 2024</p></details> |
| **[One for All: Toward Unified Foundation Models for Earth Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07527v2)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models characterized by extensive parameters and trained on large-scale datasets have demonstrated remarkable efficacy across various downstream tasks for remote sensing data. Current remote sensing foundation models typically specialize in a single modality or a specific spatial resolution range, limiting their versatility for downstream datasets. While there have been attempts to develop multi-modal remote sensing foundation models, they typically employ separate vision encoders for each modality or spatial resolution, necessitating a switch in backbones contingent upon the input data. To address this issue, we introduce a simple yet effective method, termed OFA-Net (One-For-All Network): employing a single, shared Transformer backbone for multiple data modalities with different spatial resolutions. Using the masked image modeling mechanism, we pre-train a single Transformer backbone on a curated multi-modal dataset with this simple design. Then the backbone model can be used in different downstream tasks, thus forging a path towards a unified foundation backbone model in Earth vision. The proposed method is evaluated on 12 distinct downstream tasks and demonstrates promising performance.</p></details> | 5 pages |

Recent studies in VPR have highlighted the significant advantage of employing pre-trained foundation models like DINOv2 for the VPR task. However, these models are often deemed inadequate for VPR without further fine-tuning on task-specific data. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful approach to better exploit the potential of a foundation model for VPR. We first demonstrate that features extracted from self-attention layers can serve as a powerful re-ranker for VPR. Utilizing these features in a zero-shot manner, our method surpasses previous zero-shot methods and achieves competitive results compared to supervised methods across multiple datasets. Subsequently, we demonstrate that a single-stage method leveraging internal ViT layers for pooling can generate global features that achieve state-of-the-art results, even when reduced to a dimensionality as low as 128D. Nevertheless, incorporating our local foundation features for re-ranking, expands this gap. Our approach further demonstrates remarkable robustness and generalization, achieving state-of-the-art results, with a significant gap, in challenging scenarios, involving occlusion, day-night variations, and seasonal changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text-Free Multi-domain Graph Pre-training: Toward Graph Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13934v3)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the ubiquity of graph data, it is intriguing to ask: Is it possible to train a graph foundation model on a broad range of graph data across diverse domains? A major hurdle toward this goal lies in the fact that graphs from different domains often exhibit profoundly divergent characteristics. Although there have been some initial efforts in integrating multi-domain graphs for pre-training, they primarily rely on textual descriptions to align the graphs, limiting their application to text-attributed graphs. Moreover, different source domains may conflict or interfere with each other, and their relevance to the target domain can vary significantly. To address these issues, we propose MDGPT, a text free Multi-Domain Graph Pre-Training and adaptation framework designed to exploit multi-domain knowledge for graph learning. First, we propose a set of domain tokens to to align features across source domains for synergistic pre-training. Second, we propose a dual prompts, consisting of a unifying prompt and a mixing prompt, to further adapt the target domain with unified multi-domain knowledge and a tailored mixture of domain-specific knowledge. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments involving six public datasets to evaluate and analyze MDGPT, which outperforms prior art by up to 37.9%.</p></details> | Under review |

The incentives to attack them have been growing rapidly as has their attack surface due to increasing levels of connectedness. Therefore, we feel it is time to bring in rigorous reasoning to secure such systems. The distributed system security and the game theory technical communities can come together to effectively address this challenge. In this article, we lay out the foundations from each that we can build upon to achieve our goals. Next, we describe a set of research challenges for the community, organized into three categories -- analytical, systems, and integration challenges, each with "short term" time horizon (2-3 years) and "long term" (5-10 years) items.

Backdoor attacks usually require retraining the target model, which is impractical for very large foundation models. Existing backdoor attacks are mainly designed for supervised classifiers or small foundation models (e.g., BERT). None of these attacks has successfully compromised a very large foundation model, such as Llama-3-70B, especially with limited computational resources. In this paper, we propose TrojFM, a novel backdoor attack tailored for very large foundation models. Our primary technical contribution is the development of a novel backdoor injection method. This method forces a backdoored model to generate similar hidden representations for poisoned inputs regardless of their actual semantics. Our approach injects such backdoors by fine-tuning only a very small proportion of model parameters. This enables TrojFM to efficiently launch downstream task-agnostic backdoor attacks against very large foundation models under limited computational resources. Moreover, we optimize the fine-tuning process with our customized QLoRA technique, enabling launching our attack via only~\textit{one A100 GPU}. Furthermore, we design a new trigger injection method to ensure our attack stealthiness. Through extensive experiments, we first demonstrate that TrojFM can launch effective backdoor attacks against widely used large GPT-style models without jeopardizing their normal functionalities (and outperforming existing attacks on BERT-style models). Furthermore, we show that TrojFM is resilient to SOTA defenses and is insensitive to changes in key hyper-parameters. Finally, we conduct a resource analysis to quantify that our method can significantly save computational and memory costs compared to existing backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Responsible and Safe AI in the Era of Foudnation Models: A Reference Architecture for Designing Foundation Model based Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11090v4)** | 2024-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The release of ChatGPT, Gemini, and other large language model has drawn huge interests on foundations models. There is a broad consensus that foundations models will be the fundamental building blocks for future AI systems. However, there is a lack of systematic guidance on the architecture design. Particularly, the the rapidly growing capabilities of foundations models can eventually absorb other components of AI systems, posing challenges of moving boundary and interface evolution in architecture design. Furthermore, incorporating foundations models into AI systems raises significant concerns about responsible and safe AI due to their opaque nature and rapidly advancing intelligence. To address these challenges, the paper first presents an architecture evolution of AI systems in the era of foundation models, transitioning from "foundation-model-as-a-connector" to "foundation-model-as-a-monolithic architecture". The paper then identifies key design decisions and proposes a pattern-oriented reference architecture for designing responsible foundation-model-based systems. The patterns can enable the potential of foundation models while ensuring associated risks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Few-shot Tuning of Foundation Models for Class-incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16625v1)** | 2024-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For the first time, we explore few-shot tuning of vision foundation models for class-incremental learning. Unlike existing few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) methods, which train an encoder on a base session to ensure forward compatibility for future continual learning, foundation models are generally trained on large unlabelled data without such considerations. This renders prior methods from traditional FSCIL incompatible for FSCIL with the foundation model. To this end, we propose Consistency-guided Asynchronous Contrastive Tuning (CoACT), a new approach to continually tune foundation models for new classes in few-shot settings. CoACT comprises three components: (i) asynchronous contrastive tuning, which learns new classes by including LoRA modules in the pre-trained encoder, while enforcing consistency between two asynchronous encoders; (ii) controlled fine-tuning, which facilitates effective tuning of a subset of the foundation model; and (iii) consistency-guided incremental tuning, which enforces additional regularization during later sessions to reduce forgetting of the learned classes. We perform an extensive study on 16 diverse datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of CoACT, outperforming the best baseline method by 2.47% on average and with up to 12.52% on individual datasets. Additionally, CoACT shows reduced forgetting and robustness in low-shot experiments. As an added bonus, CoACT shows up to 13.5% improvement in standard FSCIL over the current SOTA on benchmark evaluations. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/ShuvenduRoy/CoACT-FSCIL.</p></details> |  |

In the context of intelligent vehicles, leveraging the power of foundation models has proven to be transformative, offering notable advancements in visual understanding. Equipped with multi-modal and multi-task learning capabilities, multi-modal multi-task visual understanding foundation models (MM-VUFMs) effectively process and fuse data from diverse modalities and simultaneously handle various driving-related tasks with powerful adaptability, contributing to a more holistic understanding of the surrounding scene. In this survey, we present a systematic analysis of MM-VUFMs specifically designed for road scenes. Our objective is not only to provide a comprehensive overview of common practices, referring to task-specific models, unified multi-modal models, unified multi-task models, and foundation model prompting techniques, but also to highlight their advanced capabilities in diverse learning paradigms. These paradigms include open-world understanding, efficient transfer for road scenes, continual learning, interactive and generative capability. Moreover, we provide insights into key challenges and future trends, such as closed-loop driving systems, interpretability, embodied driving agents, and world models.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a novel lens through which we can translate these inscriptions, with the potential to allow non-specialists access to reading these texts and to aid in the decipherment of those hieroglyphs which continue to elude comprehensive interpretation. Toward this, we leverage a foundational model to segment Maya hieroglyphs from an open-source digital library dedicated to Maya artifacts. Despite the initial promise of publicly available foundational segmentation models, their effectiveness in accurately segmenting Maya hieroglyphs was initially limited. Addressing this challenge, our study involved the meticulous curation of image and label pairs with the assistance of experts in Maya art and history, enabling the fine-tuning of these foundational models. This process significantly enhanced model performance, illustrating the potential of fine-tuning approaches and the value of our expanding dataset. We plan to open-source this dataset for encouraging future research, and eventually to help make the hieroglyphic texts legible to a broader community, particularly for Maya heritage community members.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models are not tailored to support remote sensing data, which is widely used in important applications including environmental monitoring and crop-yield prediction. Satellite images are significantly different from natural images -- they can be multi-spectral, irregularly sampled across time -- and existing diffusion models trained on images from the Web do not support them. Furthermore, remote sensing data is inherently spatio-temporal, requiring conditional generation tasks not supported by traditional methods based on captions or images. In this paper, we present DiffusionSat, to date the largest generative foundation model trained on a collection of publicly available large, high-resolution remote sensing datasets. As text-based captions are sparsely available for satellite images, we incorporate the associated metadata such as geolocation as conditioning information. Our method produces realistic samples and can be used to solve multiple generative tasks including temporal generation, superresolution given multi-spectral inputs and in-painting. Our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods for satellite image generation and is the first large-scale generative foundation model for satellite imagery.

While recent efforts are focused on building such FMs by unlocking the potential of language models (LMs) for time series analysis, dedicated parameters for various downstream forecasting tasks need training, which hinders the common knowledge sharing across domains. Moreover, data owners may hesitate to share the access to local data due to privacy concerns and copyright protection, which makes it impossible to simply construct a FM on cross-domain training instances. To address these issues, we propose Time-FFM, a Federated Foundation Model for Time series forecasting by leveraging pretrained LMs. Specifically, we begin by transforming time series into the modality of text tokens. To bootstrap LMs for time series reasoning, we propose a prompt adaption module to determine domain-customized prompts dynamically instead of artificially. Given the data heterogeneity across domains, we design a personalized federated training strategy by learning global encoders and local prediction heads. Our comprehensive experiments indicate that Time-FFM outperforms state-of-the-arts and promises effective few-shot and zero-shot forecaster.</p></details> |  |
| **[PLUG: Revisiting Amodal Segmentation with Foundation Model and Hierarchical Focus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16094v1)** | 2024-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aiming to predict the complete shapes of partially occluded objects, amodal segmentation is an important step towards visual intelligence. With crucial significance, practical prior knowledge derives from sufficient training, while limited amodal annotations pose challenges to achieve better performance. To tackle this problem, utilizing the mighty priors accumulated in the foundation model, we propose the first SAM-based amodal segmentation approach, PLUG. Methodologically, a novel framework with hierarchical focus is presented to better adapt the task characteristics and unleash the potential capabilities of SAM. In the region level, due to the association and division in visible and occluded areas, inmodal and amodal regions are assigned as the focuses of distinct branches to avoid mutual disturbance. In the point level, we introduce the concept of uncertainty to explicitly assist the model in identifying and focusing on ambiguous points. Guided by the uncertainty map, a computation-economic point loss is applied to improve the accuracy of predicted boundaries. Experiments are conducted on several prominent datasets, and the results show that our proposed method outperforms existing methods with large margins. Even with fewer total parameters, our method still exhibits remarkable advantages.</p></details> |  |
| **[PatchProt: Hydrophobic patch prediction using protein foundation models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15928v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hydrophobic patches on protein surfaces play important functional roles in protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions. Large hydrophobic surfaces are also involved in the progression of aggregation diseases. Predicting exposed hydrophobic patches from a protein sequence has been shown to be a difficult task. Fine-tuning foundation models allows for adapting a model to the specific nuances of a new task using a much smaller dataset. Additionally, multi-task deep learning offers a promising solution for addressing data gaps, simultaneously outperforming single-task methods. In this study, we harnessed a recently released leading large language model ESM-2. Efficient fine-tuning of ESM-2 was achieved by leveraging a recently developed parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. This approach enabled comprehensive training of model layers without excessive parameters and without the need to include a computationally expensive multiple sequence analysis. We explored several related tasks, at local (residue) and global (protein) levels, to improve the representation of the model. As a result, our fine-tuned ESM-2 model, PatchProt, cannot only predict hydrophobic patch areas but also outperforms existing methods at predicting primary tasks, including secondary structure and surface accessibility predictions. Importantly, our analysis shows that including related local tasks can improve predictions on more difficult global tasks. This research sets a new standard for sequence-based protein property prediction and highlights the remarkable potential of fine-tuning foundation models enriching the model representation by training over related tasks.</p></details> |  |

Our model, called BrainMorph, serves as a tool that supports multi-modal, pairwise, and scalable groupwise registration. BrainMorph is trained on a massive dataset of over 100,000 3D volumes, skull-stripped and non-skull-stripped, from nearly 16,000 unique healthy and diseased subjects. BrainMorph is robust to large misalignments, interpretable via interrogating automatically-extracted keypoints, and enables rapid and controllable generation of many plausible transformations with different alignment types and different degrees of nonlinearity at test-time. We demonstrate the superiority of BrainMorph in solving 3D rigid, affine, and nonlinear registration on a variety of multi-modal brain MRI scans of healthy and diseased subjects, in both the pairwise and groupwise setting. In particular, we show registration accuracy and speeds that surpass current state-of-the-art methods, especially in the context of large initial misalignments and large group settings.

However, it is generally costly and unstable to fine-tune large foundation models using reinforcement learning (RL), and the multi-dimensionality, heterogeneity, and conflicting nature of human preferences further complicate the alignment process. In this paper, we introduce Rewards-in-Context (RiC), which conditions the response of a foundation model on multiple rewards in its prompt context and applies supervised fine-tuning for alignment. The salient features of RiC are simplicity and adaptivity, as it only requires supervised fine-tuning of a single foundation model and supports dynamic adjustment for user preferences during inference time. Inspired by the analytical solution of an abstracted convex optimization problem, our dynamic inference-time adjustment method approaches the Pareto-optimal solution for multiple objectives. Empirical evidence demonstrates the efficacy of our method in aligning both Large Language Models (LLMs) and diffusion models to accommodate diverse rewards with only around 10% GPU hours compared with multi-objective RL baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2024</p></details> |

To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.</p></details> |  |

Current smart robots are created using manual programming, mathematical models, planning frameworks, and reinforcement learning. These methods do not lead to the leaps in performance and generality seen with deep learning, generative AI, and foundation models (FMs). Today's robots do not learn to provide home care, to be nursing assistants, or to do household chores nearly as well as people do. Addressing the aspirational opportunities of robot service applications requires improving how they are created. The high cost of bipedal multi-sensory robots ("bodies") is a significant obstacle for both research and deployment. A deeper issue is that mainstream FMs ("minds") do not support sensing, acting, and learning in context in the real world. They do not lead to robots that communicate well or collaborate. They do not lead to robots that try to learn by experimenting, by asking others, or by imitation learning as appropriate. They do not lead to robots that know enough to be deployed widely in service applications. This paper focuses on what human-compatible service robots need to know. It recommends developing experiential (aka "robotic") FMs for bootstrapping them.</p></details> | 15 pages |

With the success of foundation models and especially vision-language models, recent works attempt to achieve zeroshot semantic segmentation while requiring either large-scale training or additional image/pixel level annotations. In this work, we generate free annotations for any semantic segmentation dataset using existing foundation models. We use CLIP to detect objects and SAM to generate high quality object masks. Next, we build a lightweight module on top of a self-supervised vision encoder, DinoV2, to align the patch features with a pretrained text encoder for zeroshot semantic segmentation. Our approach can bring language-based semantics to any pretrained vision encoder with minimal training. Our module is lightweight, uses foundation models as the sole source of supervision and shows impressive generalization capability from little training data with no annotation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Tuning Strikes Back: Customizing Foundation Models with Low-Rank Prompt Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15282v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has become the standard for customising Foundation Models (FMs) to user-specific downstream tasks. However, typical PEFT methods require storing multiple task-specific adapters, creating scalability issues as these adapters must be housed and run at the FM server. Traditional prompt tuning offers a potential solution by customising them through task-specific input prefixes, but it under-performs compared to other PEFT methods like LoRA. To address this gap, we propose Low-Rank Prompt Adaptation (LOPA), a prompt-tuning-based approach that performs on par with state-of-the-art PEFT methods and full fine-tuning while being more parameter-efficient and not requiring a server-based adapter. LOPA generates soft prompts by balancing between sharing task-specific information across instances and customization for each instance. It uses a low-rank decomposition of the soft-prompt component encoded for each instance to achieve parameter efficiency. We provide a comprehensive evaluation on multiple natural language understanding and code generation and understanding tasks across a wide range of foundation models with varying sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, many of these approaches introduce additional complexity, can require multiple training steps and often have a performance cost in comparison to black-box approaches. In this work, we introduce Component Features (ComFe), a novel interpretable-by-design image classification approach that is highly scalable and can obtain better accuracy and robustness in comparison to non-interpretable methods. Inspired by recent developments in computer vision foundation models, ComFe uses a transformer-decoder head and a hierarchical mixture-modelling approach with a foundation model backbone to obtain higher accuracy compared to previous interpretable models across a range of fine-grained vision benchmarks, without the need to individually tune hyper-parameters for each dataset. With only global image labels and no segmentation or part annotations, ComFe can identify consistent component features within an image and determine which of these features are informative in making a prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[EHRMamba: Towards Generalizable and Scalable Foundation Models for Electronic Health Records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14567v2)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have significantly advanced the modeling of Electronic Health Records (EHR), yet their deployment in real-world healthcare is limited by several key challenges. Firstly, the quadratic computational cost and insufficient context length of these models pose significant obstacles for hospitals in processing the extensive medical histories typical in EHR data. Additionally, existing models employ separate finetuning for each clinical task, complicating maintenance in healthcare environments. Moreover, these models focus exclusively on either clinical prediction or EHR forecasting, lacking the flexibility to perform well across both. To overcome these limitations, we introduce EHRMamba, a robust foundation model built on the Mamba architecture. EHRMamba can process sequences up to four times longer than previous models due to its linear computational cost. We also introduce a novel approach to Multitask Prompted Finetuning (MTF) for EHR data, which enables EHRMamba to simultaneously learn multiple clinical tasks in a single finetuning phase, significantly enhancing deployment and cross-task generalization. Furthermore, our model leverages the HL7 FHIR data standard to simplify integration into existing hospital systems. Alongside EHRMamba, we open-source Odyssey, a toolkit designed to support the development and deployment of EHR foundation models, with an emphasis on data standardization and interpretability. Our evaluations on the MIMIC-IV dataset demonstrate that EHRMamba advances state-of-the-art performance across 6 major clinical tasks and excels in EHR forecasting, marking a significant leap forward in the field.</p></details> | 17 Pages, 4 Figures |
| **[Intelligent Go-Explore: Standing on the Shoulders of Giant Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15143v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Go-Explore is a powerful family of algorithms designed to solve hard-exploration problems, built on the principle of archiving discovered states, and iteratively returning to and exploring from the most promising states. This approach has led to superhuman performance across a wide variety of challenging problems including Atari games and robotic control, but requires manually designing heuristics to guide exploration, which is time-consuming and infeasible in general. To resolve this, we propose Intelligent Go-Explore (IGE) which greatly extends the scope of the original Go-Explore by replacing these heuristics with the intelligence and internalized human notions of interestingness captured by giant foundation models (FMs). This provides IGE with a human-like ability to instinctively identify how interesting or promising any new state is (e.g. discovering new objects, locations, or behaviors), even in complex environments where heuristics are hard to define. Moreover, IGE offers the exciting and previously impossible opportunity to recognize and capitalize on serendipitous discoveries that cannot be predicted ahead of time. We evaluate IGE on a range of language-based tasks that require search and exploration. In Game of 24, a multistep mathematical reasoning problem, IGE reaches 100% success rate 70.8% faster than the best classic graph search baseline. Next, in BabyAI-Text, a challenging partially observable gridworld, IGE exceeds the previous SOTA with orders of magnitude fewer online samples. Finally, in TextWorld, we show the unique ability of IGE to succeed in settings requiring long-horizon exploration where prior SOTA FM agents like Reflexion completely fail. Overall, IGE combines the tremendous strengths of FMs and the powerful Go-Explore algorithm, opening up a new frontier of research into creating more generally capable agents with impressive exploration capabilities.</p></details> |  |

This issue arises as contrastive losses unintentionally dissociate features of unmatched points and pixels that share semantic labels, compromising the integrity of learned representations. To overcome this, we harness Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which have revolutionized the acquisition of pixel-level semantics, to enhance 3D representation learning. Specifically, we utilize off-the-shelf VFMs to generate semantic labels for weakly-supervised pixel-to-point contrastive distillation. Additionally, we employ von Mises-Fisher distributions to structure the feature space, ensuring semantic embeddings within the same class remain consistent across varying inputs. Furthermore, we adapt sampling probabilities of points to address imbalances in spatial distribution and category frequency, promoting comprehensive and balanced learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach mitigates the challenges posed by traditional methods and consistently surpasses existing image-to-LiDAR contrastive distillation methods in downstream tasks.

STAR is developed for prevalent speech foundation models based on Transformer-related architecture with auto-regressive decoding (e.g., Whisper, Canary). Specifically, we propose a novel indicator that empirically integrates step-wise information during decoding to assess the token-level quality of pseudo labels without ground truth, thereby guiding model updates for effective unsupervised adaptation. Experimental results show that STAR achieves an average of 13.5% relative reduction in word error rate across 14 target domains, and it sometimes even approaches the upper-bound performance of supervised adaptation. Surprisingly, we also observe that STAR prevents the adapted model from the common catastrophic forgetting problem without recalling source-domain data. Furthermore, STAR exhibits high data efficiency that only requires less than one-hour unlabeled data, and seamless generality to alternative large speech models and speech translation tasks. Our code aims to open source to the research communities.</p></details> | 23 pages, Preprint |

The challenge is the lack of labeled data for the training of foundation model. To handle this issue, a CLIP-style retinal image foundation model is developed in this paper. Our foundation model, RET-CLIP, is specifically trained on a dataset of 193,865 patients to extract general features of color fundus photographs (CFPs), employing a tripartite optimization strategy to focus on left eye, right eye, and patient level to reflect real-world clinical scenarios.

However, the scarce radio resources and stringent latency requirement make it challenging to meet these demands. To tackle these challenges, over-the-air computation (AirComp) emerges as a potential technology. Specifically, AirComp seamlessly integrates the communication and computation procedures through the superposition property of multiple-access channels, which yields a revolutionary multiple-access paradigm shift from "compute-after-communicate" to "compute-when-communicate". By this means, AirComp enables spectral-efficient and low-latency wireless data aggregation by allowing multiple devices to occupy the same channel for transmission. In this paper, we aim to present the recent advancement of AirComp in terms of foundations, technologies, and applications. The mathematical form and communication design are introduced as the foundations of AirComp, and the critical issues of AirComp over different network architectures are then discussed along with the review of existing literature. The technologies employed for the analysis and optimization on AirComp are reviewed from the information theory and signal processing perspectives. Moreover, we present the existing studies that tackle the practical implementation issues in AirComp systems, and elaborate the applications of AirComp in Internet of Things and edge intelligent networks. Finally, potential research directions are highlighted to motivate the future development of AirComp.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted by IEEE Internet of Things Journal</p></details> |

However, there is a mismatch between most clinical analysis, which is defined at the level of one or more whole slide images, and foundation models to date, which process the thousands of image tiles contained in a whole slide image separately. The requirement to train a network to aggregate information across a large number of tiles in multiple whole slide images limits these models' impact. In this work, we present a slide-level foundation model for H&E-stained histopathology, PRISM, that builds on Virchow tile embeddings and leverages clinical report text for pre-training. Using the tile embeddings, PRISM produces slide-level embeddings with the ability to generate clinical reports, resulting in several modes of use. Using text prompts, PRISM achieves zero-shot cancer detection and sub-typing performance approaching and surpassing that of a supervised aggregator model. Using the slide embeddings with linear classifiers, PRISM surpasses supervised aggregator models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning of the PRISM slide encoder yields label-efficient training for biomarker prediction, a task that typically suffers from low availability of training data; an aggregator initialized with PRISM and trained on as little as 10% of the training data can outperform a supervised baseline that uses all of the data.</p></details> |  |
| **[FMint: Bridging Human Designed and Data Pretrained Models for Differential Equation Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14688v2)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a pre-trained foundation model \textbf{FMint} (\textbf{F}oundation \textbf{M}odel based on \textbf{In}i\textbf{t}ialization), designed to speed up large-scale simulations of various differential equations with high accuracy via error correction. Human-designed simulation algorithms excel at capturing the fundamental physics of engineering problems, but often need to balance the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. While deep learning methods offer innovative solutions across numerous scientific fields, they frequently fall short in domain-specific knowledge. FMint bridges these gaps through conditioning on the initial coarse solutions obtained from conventional human-designed algorithms, and trained to obtain refined solutions for various differential equations. Based on the backbone of large language models, we adapt the in-context learning scheme to learn a universal error correction method for dynamical systems from given prompted sequences of coarse solutions. The model is pre-trained on a corpus of 600K ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and we conduct extensive experiments on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks. FMint outperforms various baselines on large-scale simulation, and demonstrates its capability in generalization to unseen ODEs. Our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of 1 to 2 orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art dynamical system simulators, and delivers a 5X speedup compared to traditional numerical algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[CrossCheckGPT: Universal Hallucination Ranking for Multimodal Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13684v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal foundation models are prone to hallucination, generating outputs that either contradict the input or are not grounded by factual information. Given the diversity in architectures, training data and instruction tuning techniques, there can be large variations in systems' susceptibility to hallucinations. To assess system hallucination robustness, hallucination ranking approaches have been developed for specific tasks such as image captioning, question answering, summarization, or biography generation. However, these approaches typically compare model outputs to gold-standard references or labels, limiting hallucination benchmarking for new domains. This work proposes "CrossCheckGPT", a reference-free universal hallucination ranking for multimodal foundation models. The core idea of CrossCheckGPT is that the same hallucinated content is unlikely to be generated by different independent systems, hence cross-system consistency can provide meaningful and accurate hallucination assessment scores. CrossCheckGPT can be applied to any model or task, provided that the information consistency between outputs can be measured through an appropriate distance metric. Focusing on multimodal large language models that generate text, we explore two information consistency measures: CrossCheck-explicit and CrossCheck-implicit. We showcase the applicability of our method for hallucination ranking across various modalities, namely the text, image, and audio-visual domains. Further, we propose the first audio-visual hallucination benchmark, "AVHalluBench", and illustrate the effectiveness of CrossCheckGPT, achieving correlations of 98% and 89% with human judgements on MHaluBench and AVHalluBench, respectively.</p></details> | 21 pages.

Nonetheless, how fine-tuning impacts performance in long-tail learning was not explicitly quantified. In this paper, we disclose that heavy fine-tuning may even lead to non-negligible performance deterioration on tail classes, and lightweight fine-tuning is more effective. The reason is attributed to inconsistent class conditions caused by heavy fine-tuning. With the observation above, we develop a low-complexity and accurate long-tail learning algorithms LIFT with the goal of facilitating fast prediction and compact models by adaptive lightweight fine-tuning. Experiments clearly verify that both the training time and the learned parameters are significantly reduced with more accurate predictive performance compared with state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2024.

Deep learning models can identify images across various semantic concepts without the need for annotations. This work proposes to use Geospatial Foundation Models, like Prithvi, for remote sensing image retrieval with multiple benefits: i) the models encode multi-spectral satellite data and ii) generalize without further fine-tuning. We introduce two datasets to the retrieval task and observe a strong performance: Prithvi processes six bands and achieves a mean Average Precision of 97.62% on BigEarthNet-43 and 44.51% on ForestNet-12, outperforming other RGB-based models. Further, we evaluate three compression methods with binarized embeddings balancing retrieval speed and accuracy. They match the retrieval speed of much shorter hash codes while maintaining the same accuracy as floating-point embeddings but with a 32-fold compression.

| **[SAM-CLIP: Merging Vision Foundation Models towards Semantic and Spatial Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15308v3)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The landscape of publicly available vision foundation models (VFMs), such as CLIP and Segment Anything Model (SAM), is expanding rapidly. VFMs are endowed with distinct capabilities stemming from their pre-training objectives. For instance, CLIP excels in semantic understanding, while SAM specializes in spatial understanding for segmentation. In this work, we introduce a simple recipe to efficiently merge VFMs into a unified model that absorbs their expertise. Our method integrates techniques of multi-task learning, continual learning, and distillation. Further, it demands significantly less computational cost compared to traditional multi-task training from scratch, and it only needs a small fraction of the pre-training datasets that were initially used to train individual models. By applying our method to SAM and CLIP, we obtain SAM-CLIP: a unified model that combines the capabilities of SAM and CLIP into a single vision transformer. Compared with deploying SAM and CLIP independently, our merged model, SAM-CLIP, reduces storage and compute costs for inference, making it well-suited for edge device applications. We show that SAM-CLIP not only retains the foundational strengths of SAM and CLIP, but also introduces synergistic functionalities, notably in zero-shot semantic segmentation, where SAM-CLIP establishes new state-of-the-art results on 5 benchmarks. It outperforms previous models that are specifically designed for this task by a large margin, including +6.8% and +5.9% mean IoU improvement on Pascal-VOC and COCO-Stuff datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, existing AI models in this domain often require extensive annotation and are task-specific, limiting their clinical utility. While recent developments have brought about foundation models for ophthalmology, they are limited by the need to train separate weights for each imaging modality, preventing a comprehensive representation of multi-modal features. This highlights the need for versatile foundation models capable of handling various tasks and modalities in ophthalmology. To address this gap, we present EyeFound, a multimodal foundation model for ophthalmic images. Unlike existing models, EyeFound learns generalizable representations from unlabeled multimodal retinal images, enabling efficient model adaptation across multiple applications. Trained on 2.78 million images from 227 hospitals across 11 ophthalmic modalities, EyeFound facilitates generalist representations and diverse multimodal downstream tasks, even for detecting challenging rare diseases. It outperforms previous work RETFound in diagnosing eye diseases, predicting systemic disease incidents, and zero-shot multimodal VQA. EyeFound provides a generalizable solution to improve model performance and lessen the annotation burden on experts, facilitating widespread clinical AI applications for retinal imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Conformal Alignment: Knowing When to Trust Foundation Models with Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10301v2)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Before deploying outputs from foundation models in high-stakes tasks, it is imperative to ensure that they align with human values. For instance, in radiology report generation, reports generated by a vision-language model must align with human evaluations before their use in medical decision-making. This paper presents Conformal Alignment, a general framework for identifying units whose outputs meet a user-specified alignment criterion. It is guaranteed that on average, a prescribed fraction of selected units indeed meet the alignment criterion, regardless of the foundation model or the data distribution. Given any pre-trained model and new units with model-generated outputs, Conformal Alignment leverages a set of reference data with ground-truth alignment status to train an alignment predictor. It then selects new units whose predicted alignment scores surpass a data-dependent threshold, certifying their corresponding outputs as trustworthy. Through applications to question answering and radiology report generation, we demonstrate that our method is able to accurately identify units with trustworthy outputs via lightweight training over a moderate amount of reference data. En route, we investigate the informativeness of various features in alignment prediction and combine them with standard models to construct the alignment predictor.</p></details> |  |

However, our investigation shows that despite these gains, their potential for real-world applications is restricted by their limited generalization capabilities to novel image domains. In this paper, we introduce OmniGlue, the first learnable image matcher that is designed with generalization as a core principle. OmniGlue leverages broad knowledge from a vision foundation model to guide the feature matching process, boosting generalization to domains not seen at training time. Additionally, we propose a novel keypoint position-guided attention mechanism which disentangles spatial and appearance information, leading to enhanced matching descriptors. We perform comprehensive experiments on a suite of $7$ datasets with varied image domains, including scene-level, object-centric and aerial images. OmniGlue's novel components lead to relative gains on unseen domains of $20.9\%$ with respect to a directly comparable reference model, while also outperforming the recent LightGlue method by $9.5\%$ relatively.Code and model can be found at https://hwjiang1510.github.io/OmniGlue</p></details> | CVPR 2024 |

Holistic image analysis comprises interdependent subtasks such as segmentation, detection, and recognition of relevant objects. Here, we propose BiomedParse, a biomedical foundation model for imaging parsing that can jointly conduct segmentation, detection, and recognition for 82 object types across 9 imaging modalities. Through joint learning, we can improve accuracy for individual tasks and enable novel applications such as segmenting all relevant objects in an image through a text prompt, rather than requiring users to laboriously specify the bounding box for each object. We leveraged readily available natural-language labels or descriptions accompanying those datasets and use GPT-4 to harmonize the noisy, unstructured text information with established biomedical object ontologies. We created a large dataset comprising over six million triples of image, segmentation mask, and textual description. On image segmentation, we showed that BiomedParse is broadly applicable, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on 102,855 test image-mask-label triples across 9 imaging modalities (everything). On object detection, which aims to locate a specific object of interest, BiomedParse again attained state-of-the-art performance, especially on objects with irregular shapes (everywhere). On object recognition, which aims to identify all objects in a given image along with their semantic types, we showed that BiomedParse can simultaneously segment and label all biomedical objects in an image (all at once). In summary, BiomedParse is an all-in-one tool for biomedical image analysis by jointly solving segmentation, detection, and recognition for all major biomedical image modalities, paving the path for efficient and accurate image-based biomedical discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://aka.ms/biomedparse-project</p></details> |

These models have been particularly impactful in the domain of medical diagnostic tasks. With abundant unlabeled data, an LFM has been developed for fundus images using the Vision Transformer (VIT) and a self-supervised learning framework. This LFM has shown promising performance in fundus disease diagnosis across multiple datasets. On the other hand, deep learning models have long been challenged by dataset quality issues, such as image quality and dataset bias. To investigate the influence of data quality on LFM, we conducted explorations in two fundus diagnosis tasks using datasets of varying quality. Specifically, we explored the following questions: Is LFM more robust to image quality? Is LFM affected by dataset bias? Can fine-tuning techniques alleviate these effects? Our investigation found that LFM exhibits greater resilience to dataset quality issues, including image quality and dataset bias, compared to typical convolutional networks. Furthermore, we discovered that overall fine-tuning is an effective adapter for LFM to mitigate the impact of dataset quality issues.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

Current solutions in this field remain rooted in conventional deep learning paradigms, requiring the construction of annotated datasets and the design of network architectures. However, the evident drawback with these mainstream solutions lies in the time-consuming and labor-intensive process of curating datasets, alongside the increasing complexity of model structures. In this paper, we propose to address these issues by fully harnessing the capabilities of two existing vision foundation models (VFMs): Stable Diffusion and Segment Anything Model (SAM). Firstly, we construct a Synthetic but photorealistic large-scale Glass Surface Detection dataset, dubbed S-GSD, without any labour cost via Stable Diffusion. This dataset consists of four different scales, consisting of 168k images totally with precise masks. Besides, based on the powerful segmentation ability of SAM, we devise a simple Glass surface sEgMentor named GEM, which follows the simple query-based encoder-decoder architecture. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the large-scale glass segmentation dataset GSD-S. Our GEM establishes a new state-of-the-art performance with the help of these two VFMs, surpassing the best-reported method GlassSemNet with an IoU improvement of 2.1%. Additionally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our synthetic dataset S-GSD exhibits remarkable performance in zero-shot and transfer learning settings.

However, the proliferation of FMs brings forth a critical challenge: the potential to generate hallucinated outputs, particularly in high-stakes applications. The tendency of foundation models to produce hallucinated content arguably represents the biggest hindrance to their widespread adoption in real-world scenarios, especially in domains where reliability and accuracy are paramount. This survey paper presents a comprehensive overview of recent developments that aim to identify and mitigate the problem of hallucination in FMs, spanning text, image, video, and audio modalities. By synthesizing recent advancements in detecting and mitigating hallucination across various modalities, the paper aims to provide valuable insights for researchers, developers, and practitioners. Essentially, it establishes a clear framework encompassing definition, taxonomy, and detection strategies for addressing hallucination in multimodal foundation models, laying the foundation for future research in this pivotal area.</p></details> |  |

Given the challenges of obtaining accurate first-principles models for real-world chemical processes and the inefficiency of rebuilding and retraining models for new chemical processes, we pose a pivotal question: What if we could develop a single, universal neural network (i.e., foundation model) capable of rapidly adapting to modeling any new chemical process? To address this question, we propose a meta-learning-based approach using Reptile to construct the foundation model, followed by physics-informed adaptation to fine-tune it to new modeling tasks using only a few data samples. To assess the effectiveness of our methodology, we construct a foundation model for various chemical reactions in three classical generic reactors, including continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs), batch reactors (BRs), and plug flow reactors (PFRs). Our approach outperforms conventional methods such as data-driven learning, physics-informed learning, transfer learning, and pure meta-learning in a few-shot setting. Furthermore, our method achieves rapid adaptation to new CSTRs, BRs, and PFRs using only a few data samples from the designated tasks.

We have curated a distinctive dataset of 283,582 unique video clips categorized under 386 hashtags relating to modern human actions. We release this dataset as a valuable resource for building domain-specific foundation models for human movement modeling tasks such as action recognition. To validate this dataset, which we name TikTokActions, we perform two sets of experiments. First, we pretrain the state-of-the-art VideoMAEv2 with a ViT-base backbone on TikTokActions subset, and then fine-tune and evaluate on popular datasets such as UCF101 and the HMDB51. We find that the performance of the model pre-trained using our Tik-Tok dataset is comparable to models trained on larger action recognition datasets (95.3% on UCF101 and 53.24% on HMDB51). Furthermore, our investigation into the relationship between pre-training dataset size and fine-tuning performance reveals that beyond a certain threshold, the incremental benefit of larger training sets diminishes. This work introduces a useful TikTok video dataset that is available for public use and provides insights into the marginal benefit of increasing pre-training dataset sizes for video-based foundation models.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, this discussion has often taken place at a high level of generality or with a narrow focus on specific technical attributes. In part, this is because defining open source for foundation models has proven tricky, given its significant differences from traditional software development. In order to inform more practical and nuanced decisions about opening AI systems, including foundation models, this paper presents a framework for grappling with openness across the AI stack. It summarizes previous work on this topic, analyzes the various potential reasons to pursue openness, and outlines how openness varies in different parts of the AI stack, both at the model and at the system level. In doing so, its authors hope to provide a common descriptive framework to deepen a nuanced and rigorous understanding of openness in AI and enable further work around definitions of openness and safety in AI.</p></details> |  |

The application of FMs in autonomous driving holds considerable promise. For example, they can contribute to enhancing scene understanding and reasoning. By pre-training on rich linguistic and visual data, FMs can understand and interpret various elements in a driving scene, and provide cognitive reasoning to give linguistic and action instructions for driving decisions and planning. Furthermore, FMs can augment data based on the understanding of driving scenarios to provide feasible scenes of those rare occurrences in the long tail distribution that are unlikely to be encountered during routine driving and data collection. The enhancement can subsequently lead to improvement in the accuracy and reliability of autonomous driving systems. Another testament to the potential of FMs' applications lies in World Models, exemplified by the DREAMER series, which showcases the ability to comprehend physical laws and dynamics. Learning from massive data under the paradigm of self-supervised learning, World Model can generate unseen yet plausible driving environments, facilitating the enhancement in the prediction of road users' behaviors and the off-line training of driving strategies. In this paper, we synthesize the applications and future trends of FMs in autonomous driving. By utilizing the powerful capabilities of FMs, we strive to tackle the potential issues stemming from the long-tail distribution in autonomous driving, consequently advancing overall safety in this domain.</p></details> | 45 pages,8 figures |

Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic knowledge to guide practitioners in designing the agents considering challenges of goal-seeking (including generating instrumental goals and plans), such as hallucinations inherent in foundation models, explainability of reasoning process, complex accountability, etc. To address this issue, we have performed a systematic literature review to understand the state-of-the-art foundation model-based agents and the broader ecosystem. In this paper, we present a pattern catalogue consisting of 16 architectural patterns with analyses of the context, forces, and trade-offs as the outcomes from the previous literature review. The proposed catalogue can provide holistic guidance for the effective use of patterns, and support the architecture design of foundation model-based agents by facilitating goal-seeking and plan generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Foundation Model for Brain Lesion Segmentation with Mixture of Modality Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10246v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain lesion segmentation plays an essential role in neurological research and diagnosis. As brain lesions can be caused by various pathological alterations, different types of brain lesions tend to manifest with different characteristics on different imaging modalities. Due to this complexity, brain lesion segmentation methods are often developed in a task-specific manner. A specific segmentation model is developed for a particular lesion type and imaging modality. However, the use of task-specific models requires predetermination of the lesion type and imaging modality, which complicates their deployment in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a universal foundation model for 3D brain lesion segmentation, which can automatically segment different types of brain lesions for input data of various imaging modalities. We formulate a novel Mixture of Modality Experts (MoME) framework with multiple expert networks attending to different imaging modalities. A hierarchical gating network combines the expert predictions and fosters expertise collaboration. Furthermore, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy during training to avoid the degeneration of each expert network and preserve their specialization. We evaluated the proposed method on nine brain lesion datasets, encompassing five imaging modalities and eight lesion types. The results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art universal models and provides promising generalization to unseen datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>The w...</summary><p>The work has been early accepted by MICCAI 2024</p></details> |

However, its application to time series data, particularly within foundational models, remains underexplored. This paper examines the impact of LoRA on contemporary time series foundational models: Lag-Llama, MOIRAI, and Chronos. We demonstrate LoRA's fine-tuning potential for forecasting the vital signs of sepsis patients in intensive care units (ICUs), emphasizing the models' adaptability to previously unseen, out-of-domain modalities. Integrating LoRA aims to enhance forecasting performance while reducing inefficiencies associated with fine-tuning large models on limited domain-specific data. Our experiments show that LoRA fine-tuning of time series foundational models significantly improves forecasting, achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art models trained from scratch on similar modalities. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies to demonstrate the trade-offs between the number of tunable parameters and forecasting performance and assess the impact of varying LoRA matrix ranks on model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures.

In reality, an ideal robust model will probably behave similarly to the oracle (e.g., the human users), thus a good evaluation protocol is probably to evaluate the models' behaviors in comparison to the oracle. In this paper, we introduce a new robustness measurement that directly measures the image classification model's performance compared with a surrogate oracle (i.e., a foundation model). Besides, we design a simple method that can accomplish the evaluation beyond the scope of the benchmarks. Our method extends the image datasets with new samples that are sufficiently perturbed to be distinct from the ones in the original sets, but are still bounded within the same image-label structure the original test image represents, constrained by a foundation model pretrained with a large amount of samples. As a result, our new method will offer us a new way to evaluate the models' robustness performance, free of limitations of fixed benchmarks or constrained perturbations, although scoped by the power of the oracle. In addition to the evaluation results, we also leverage our generated data to understand the behaviors of the model and our new evaluation strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2024 Poster</p></details> |
| **[Histopathology Foundation Models Enable Accurate Ovarian Cancer Subtype Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09990v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pretrained transformers are increasingly being developed as generalised foundation models which can underpin powerful task-specific artificial intelligence models. Histopathology foundation models show promise across many tasks, but analyses have been limited by arbitrary hyperparameters that were not tuned to the specific task/dataset. We report the most rigorous single-task validation conducted to date of a histopathology foundation model, and the first performed in ovarian cancer subtyping. Attention-based multiple instance learning classifiers were compared using vision transformer and ResNet features generated through varied preprocessing and pretraining procedures. The training set consisted of 1864 whole slide images from 434 ovarian carcinoma cases at Leeds Hospitals. Five-class classification performance was evaluated through five-fold cross-validation, and these cross-validation models were ensembled for evaluation on a hold-out test set and an external set from the Transcanadian study. Reporting followed the TRIPOD+AI checklist. The vision transformer-based histopathology foundation model, UNI, performed best in every evaluation, with five-class balanced accuracies of 88% and 93% in hold-out internal and external testing, compared to the best ResNet model scores of 68% and 81%, respectively. Normalisations and augmentations aided the generalisability of ResNet-based models, but these still did not match the performance of UNI, which gave the best external performance in any ovarian cancer subtyping study to date. Histopathology foundation models offer a clear benefit to subtyping, improving classification performance to a degree where clinical utility is tangible, albeit with an increased computational burden. Such models could provide a second opinion in challenging cases and may improve the accuracy, objectivity, and efficiency of pathological diagnoses overall.</p></details> |  |
| **[Many-Shot In-Context Learning in Multimodal Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09798v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models are well-known to be effective at few-shot in-context learning (ICL). Recent advancements in multimodal foundation models have enabled unprecedentedly long context windows, presenting an opportunity to explore their capability to perform ICL with many more demonstrating examples. In this work, we evaluate the performance of multimodal foundation models scaling from few-shot to many-shot ICL. We benchmark GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro across 10 datasets spanning multiple domains (natural imagery, medical imagery, remote sensing, and molecular imagery) and tasks (multi-class, multi-label, and fine-grained classification). We observe that many-shot ICL, including up to almost 2,000 multimodal demonstrating examples, leads to substantial improvements compared to few-shot (<100 examples) ICL across all of the datasets. Further, Gemini 1.5 Pro performance continues to improve log-linearly up to the maximum number of tested examples on many datasets. Given the high inference costs associated with the long prompts required for many-shot ICL, we also explore the impact of batching multiple queries in a single API call. We show that batching up to 50 queries can lead to performance improvements under zero-shot and many-shot ICL, with substantial gains in the zero-shot setting on multiple datasets, while drastically reducing per-query cost and latency. Finally, we measure ICL data efficiency of the models, or the rate at which the models learn from more demonstrating examples. We find that while GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro achieve similar zero-shot performance across the datasets, Gemini 1.5 Pro exhibits higher ICL data efficiency than GPT-4o on most datasets. Our results suggest that many-shot ICL could enable users to efficiently adapt multimodal foundation models to new applications and domains.

| **[Benchmark Early and Red Team Often: A Framework for Assessing and Managing Dual-Use Hazards of AI Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10986v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A concern about cutting-edge or "frontier" AI foundation models is that an adversary may use the models for preparing chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, (CBRN), cyber, or other attacks. At least two methods can identify foundation models with potential dual-use capability; each has advantages and disadvantages: A. Open benchmarks (based on openly available questions and answers), which are low-cost but accuracy-limited by the need to omit security-sensitive details; and B. Closed red team evaluations (based on private evaluation by CBRN and cyber experts), which are higher-cost but can achieve higher accuracy by incorporating sensitive details. We propose a research and risk-management approach using a combination of methods including both open benchmarks and closed red team evaluations, in a way that leverages advantages of both methods. We recommend that one or more groups of researchers with sufficient resources and access to a range of near-frontier and frontier foundation models run a set of foundation models through dual-use capability evaluation benchmarks and red team evaluations, then analyze the resulting sets of models' scores on benchmark and red team evaluations to see how correlated those are. If, as we expect, there is substantial correlation between the dual-use potential benchmark scores and the red team evaluation scores, then implications include the following: The open benchmarks should be used frequently during foundation model development as a quick, low-cost measure of a model's dual-use potential; and if a particular model gets a high score on the dual-use potential benchmark, then more in-depth red team assessments of that model's dual-use capability should be performed. We also discuss limitations and mitigations for our approach, e.g., if model developers try to game benchmarks by including a version of benchmark test data in a model's training data.</p></details> | 62 pages |

SAR Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) focuses on detecting and classifying various target categories under different image conditions. The current deep learning-based SAR ATR methods are typically designed for specific datasets and applications. Various target characteristics, scene background information, and sensor parameters across ATR datasets challenge the generalization of those methods. This paper aims to achieve general SAR ATR based on a foundation model with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). Our motivation is to break through the specific dataset and condition limitations and obtain universal perceptual capabilities across the target, scene, and sensor. A foundation model named SARATR-X is proposed with the following four aspects: pre-training dataset, model backbone, SSL, and evaluation task. First, we integrated 14 datasets with various target categories and imaging conditions as a pre-training dataset. Second, different model backbones were discussed to find the most suitable approaches for remote-sensing images. Third, we applied two-stage training and SAR gradient features to ensure the diversity and scalability of SARATR-X. Finally, SARATR-X has achieved competitive and superior performance on 5 datasets with 8 task settings, which shows that the foundation model can achieve universal SAR ATR. We believe it is time to embrace fundamental models for SAR image interpretation in the era of increasing big data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wisdom of Committee: Distilling from Foundation Model to Specialized Application Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14035v3)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in foundation models have yielded impressive performance across a wide range of tasks. Meanwhile, for specific applications, practitioners have been developing specialized application models. To enjoy the benefits of both kinds of models, one natural path is to transfer the knowledge in foundation models into specialized application models, which are generally more efficient for serving. Techniques from knowledge distillation may be applied here, where the application model learns to mimic the foundation model. However, specialized application models and foundation models have substantial gaps in capacity, employing distinct architectures, using different input features from different modalities, and being optimized on different distributions. These differences in model characteristics lead to significant challenges for distillation methods. In this work, we propose creating a teaching committee comprising both foundation model teachers and complementary teachers. Complementary teachers possess model characteristics akin to the student's, aiming to bridge the gap between the foundation model and specialized application models for a smoother knowledge transfer. Further, to accommodate the dissimilarity among the teachers in the committee, we introduce DiverseDistill, which allows the student to understand the expertise of each teacher and extract task knowledge. Our evaluations demonstrate that adding complementary teachers enhances student performance. Finally, DiverseDistill consistently outperforms baseline distillation methods, regardless of the teacher choices, resulting in significantly improved student performance.</p></details> |  |

There is an explosion of computational methods and tools, particularly computer vision, for extracting biologically relevant information from images for science and conservation. Yet most of these are bespoke approaches designed for a specific task and are not easily adaptable or extendable to new questions, contexts, and datasets. A vision model for general organismal biology questions on images is of timely need. To approach this, we curate and release TreeOfLife-10M, the largest and most diverse ML-ready dataset of biology images. We then develop BioCLIP, a foundation model for the tree of life, leveraging the unique properties of biology captured by TreeOfLife-10M, namely the abundance and variety of images of plants, animals, and fungi, together with the availability of rich structured biological knowledge. We rigorously benchmark our approach on diverse fine-grained biology classification tasks and find that BioCLIP consistently and substantially outperforms existing baselines (by 16% to 17% absolute). Intrinsic evaluation reveals that BioCLIP has learned a hierarchical representation conforming to the tree of life, shedding light on its strong generalizability. https://imageomics.github.io/bioclip has models, data and code.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024 (oral) camera-ready version; data released</p></details> |

Despite the significant achievements of foundation models in vision tasks, including depth estimation, their direct application to the medical domain often results in suboptimal performance. This highlights the need for efficient adaptation methods to adapt these models to endoscopic depth estimation. We propose Endoscopic Depth Any Camera (EndoDAC) which is an efficient self-supervised depth estimation framework that adapts foundation models to endoscopic scenes. Specifically, we develop the Dynamic Vector-Based Low-Rank Adaptation (DV-LoRA) and employ Convolutional Neck blocks to tailor the foundational model to the surgical domain, utilizing remarkably few trainable parameters. Given that camera information is not always accessible, we also introduce a self-supervised adaptation strategy that estimates camera intrinsics using the pose encoder. Our framework is capable of being trained solely on monocular surgical videos from any camera, ensuring minimal training costs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach obtains superior performance even with fewer training epochs and unaware of the ground truth camera intrinsics.

The DeepSEA system has a small but sufficiently rich programming language amenable for verification, the DeepSEA language, and a verified DeepSEA compiler. Together they enable true end-to-end verification for smart contracts. We demonstrate usability through two case studies: a realistic contract for Decentralized Finance and contract for crowdfunding.</p></details> | 27 pages, 6 figures |
| **[A Billion-scale Foundation Model for Remote Sensing Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05215v3)** | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the potential of foundation models in visual tasks has garnered significant attention, pretraining these models before downstream tasks has become a crucial step. The three key factors in pretraining foundation models are the pretraining method, the size of the pretraining dataset, and the number of model parameters. Recently, research in the remote sensing field has focused primarily on the pretraining method and the size of the dataset, with limited emphasis on the number of model parameters. This paper addresses this gap by examining the effect of increasing the number of model parameters on the performance of foundation models in downstream tasks such as rotated object detection and semantic segmentation. We pretrained foundation models with varying numbers of parameters, including 86M, 605.26M, 1.3B, and 2.4B, to determine whether performance in downstream tasks improved with an increase in parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first billion-scale foundation model in the remote sensing field. Furthermore, we propose an effective method for scaling up and fine-tuning a vision transformer in the remote sensing field. To evaluate general performance in downstream tasks, we employed the DOTA v2.0 and DIOR-R benchmark datasets for rotated object detection, and the Potsdam and LoveDA datasets for semantic segmentation. Experimental results demonstrated that, across all benchmark datasets and downstream tasks, the performance of the foundation models and data efficiency improved as the number of parameters increased. Moreover, our models achieve the state-of-the-art performance on several datasets including DIOR-R, Postdam, and LoveDA.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is the accepted version for IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing (IEEE J-STARS)</p></details> |

Pre-training large models on time series data is challenging due to (1) the absence of a large and cohesive public time series repository, and (2) diverse time series characteristics which make multi-dataset training onerous. Additionally, (3) experimental benchmarks to evaluate these models, especially in scenarios with limited resources, time, and supervision, are still in their nascent stages. To address these challenges, we compile a large and diverse collection of public time series, called the Time series Pile, and systematically tackle time series-specific challenges to unlock large-scale multi-dataset pre-training. Finally, we build on recent work to design a benchmark to evaluate time series foundation models on diverse tasks and datasets in limited supervision settings. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our pre-trained models with minimal data and task-specific fine-tuning. Finally, we present several interesting empirical observations about large pre-trained time series models.

However, creating such datasets remains challenging due to the complexity and heterogeneity of medical data. To address this challenge, we introduce HoneyBee, a scalable modular framework for building multimodal oncology datasets that leverages foundational models to generate representative embeddings. HoneyBee integrates various data modalities, including clinical records, imaging data, and patient outcomes. It employs data preprocessing techniques and transformer-based architectures to generate embeddings that capture the essential features and relationships within the raw medical data. The generated embeddings are stored in a structured format using Hugging Face datasets and PyTorch dataloaders for accessibility. Vector databases enable efficient querying and retrieval for machine learning applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HoneyBee through experiments assessing the quality and representativeness of the embeddings. The framework is designed to be extensible to other medical domains and aims to accelerate oncology research by providing high-quality, machine learning-ready datasets. HoneyBee is an ongoing open-source effort, and the code, datasets, and models are available at the project repository.</p></details> |  |

While foundation models have been useful in natural language processing and some vision tasks for some time, the foundation model developed with image segmentation in mind - Segment Anything Model (SAM) - has been developed only recently and has shown similar promise. However, there are still no systematic analyses or "best-practice" guidelines for optimal fine-tuning of SAM for medical image segmentation. This work summarizes existing fine-tuning strategies with various backbone architectures, model components, and fine-tuning algorithms across 18 combinations, and evaluates them on 17 datasets covering all common radiology modalities. Our study reveals that (1) fine-tuning SAM leads to slightly better performance than previous segmentation methods, (2) fine-tuning strategies that use parameter-efficient learning in both the encoder and decoder are superior to other strategies, (3) network architecture has a small impact on final performance, (4) further training SAM with self-supervised learning can improve final model performance. We also demonstrate the ineffectiveness of some methods popular in the literature and further expand our experiments into few-shot and prompt-based settings.

We collected data from 18 researchers using an interface that we designed using network simplification methods and analyzed how users browsed and identified important papers. Our analysis reveals six major patterns used for identifying papers of interest, which can be categorized into three key components: Fields, Bridges, and Foundations, each viewed from two distinct perspectives: layout-oriented and connection-oriented. The connection-oriented approach was found to be more effective for selecting relevant papers, but the layout-oriented method was adopted more often, even though it led to unexpected results and user frustration. Our findings emphasize the importance of integrating these components and the necessity to balance visual layouts with meaningful connections to enhance the effectiveness of citation networks in academic browsing systems.</p></details> |  |

However, despite early promising results on some biomedical benchmarks, there are still major challenges that need to be addressed before these models can be used in real-world clinics. Frontier general-domain models such as GPT-4V still have significant performance gaps in multimodal biomedical applications. More importantly, less-acknowledged pragmatic issues, including accessibility, model cost, and tedious manual evaluation make it hard for clinicians to use state-of-the-art large models directly on private patient data. Here, we explore training open-source small multimodal models (SMMs) to bridge competency gaps for unmet clinical needs in radiology. To maximize data efficiency, we adopt a modular approach by incorporating state-of-the-art pre-trained models for image and text modalities, and focusing on training a lightweight adapter to ground each modality to the text embedding space, as exemplified by LLaVA-Med. For training, we assemble a large dataset of over 697 thousand radiology image-text pairs. For evaluation, we propose CheXprompt, a GPT-4-based metric for factuality evaluation, and demonstrate its parity with expert evaluation. For best practice, we conduct a systematic ablation study on various choices in data engineering and multimodal training. The resulting LlaVA-Rad (7B) model attains state-of-the-art results on standard radiology tasks such as report generation and cross-modal retrieval, even outperforming much larger models such as GPT-4V and Med-PaLM M (84B). The inference of LlaVA-Rad is fast and can be performed on a single V100 GPU in private settings, offering a promising state-of-the-art tool for real-world clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

Foundation models such as ChatGPT, LLaMa, and CLIP, which are trained on vast datasets through methods including unsupervised pretraining, self-supervised learning, instructed fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback, represent significant advancements in machine learning. These models, with their ability to generate coherent text and realistic images, are crucial for biomedical applications that require processing diverse data forms such as clinical reports, diagnostic images, and multimodal patient interactions. The incorporation of FL with these sophisticated models presents a promising strategy to harness their analytical power while safeguarding the privacy of sensitive medical data. This approach not only enhances the capabilities of FMs in medical diagnostics and personalized treatment but also addresses critical concerns about data privacy and security in healthcare. This survey reviews the current applications of FMs in federated settings, underscores the challenges, and identifies future research directions including scaling FMs, managing data diversity, and enhancing communication efficiency within FL frameworks. The objective is to encourage further research into the combined potential of FMs and FL, laying the groundwork for groundbreaking healthcare innovations.</p></details> | 42 pages |

Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) offers a cost-efficient workaround to extensive labeling in comparison to fully-supervised methods by using partial or incomplete labels. Existing WSSS methods have difficulties in learning the boundaries of objects leading to poor segmentation results. We propose a novel and effective framework that addresses these issues by leveraging visual foundation models inside the bounding box. Adopting a two-stage WSSS framework, our proposed network consists of a pseudo-label generation module and a segmentation module. The first stage leverages Segment Anything Model (SAM) to generate high-quality pseudo-labels. To alleviate the problem of delineating precise boundaries, we adopt SAM inside the bounding box with the help of another pre-trained foundation model (e.g., Grounding-DINO). Furthermore, we eliminate the necessity of using the supervision of image labels, by employing CLIP in classification. Then in the second stage, the generated high-quality pseudo-labels are used to train an off-the-shelf segmenter that achieves the state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning from SAM: Harnessing a Foundation Model for Sim2Real Adaptation by Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15562v3)** | 2024-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain adaptation is especially important for robotics applications, where target domain training data is usually scarce and annotations are costly to obtain. We present a method for self-supervised domain adaptation for the scenario where annotated source domain data (e.g. from synthetic generation) is available, but the target domain data is completely unannotated. Our method targets the semantic segmentation task and leverages a segmentation foundation model (Segment Anything Model) to obtain segment information on unannotated data. We take inspiration from recent advances in unsupervised local feature learning and propose an invariance-variance loss over the detected segments for regularizing feature representations in the target domain. Crucially, this loss structure and network architecture can handle overlapping segments and oversegmentation as produced by Segment Anything. We demonstrate the advantage of our method on the challenging YCB-Video and HomebrewedDB datasets and show that it outperforms prior work and, on YCB-Video, even a network trained with real annotations. Additionally, we provide insight through model ablations and show applicability to a custom robotic application.</p></details> |  |
| **[Muting Whisper: A Universal Acoustic Adversarial Attack on Speech Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06134v1)** | 2024-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in large speech foundation models like Whisper have led to their widespread use in many automatic speech recognition (ASR) applications. These systems incorporate `special tokens' in their vocabulary, such as $\texttt{<endoftext>}$, to guide their language generation process. However, we demonstrate that these tokens can be exploited by adversarial attacks to manipulate the model's behavior. We propose a simple yet effective method to learn a universal acoustic realization of Whisper's $\texttt{<endoftext>}$ token, which, when prepended to any speech signal, encourages the model to ignore the speech and only transcribe the special token, effectively `muting' the model. Our experiments demonstrate that the same, universal 0.64-second adversarial audio segment can successfully mute a target Whisper ASR model for over 97\% of speech samples. Moreover, we find that this universal adversarial audio segment often transfers to new datasets and tasks. Overall this work demonstrates the vulnerability of Whisper models to `muting' adversarial attacks, where such attacks can pose both risks and potential benefits in real-world settings: for example the attack can be used to bypass speech moderation systems, or conversely the attack can also be used to protect private speech data.</p></details> |  |

Their incorporation has been rapid and transformative, marking a significant paradigm shift in the field of machine learning research. However, the field of experimental design, grounded on black-box optimization, has been much less affected by such a paradigm shift, even though integrating LLMs with optimization presents a unique landscape ripe for exploration. In this position paper, we frame the field of black-box optimization around sequence-based foundation models and organize their relationship with previous literature. We discuss the most promising ways foundational language models can revolutionize optimization, which include harnessing the vast wealth of information encapsulated in free-form text to enrich task comprehension, utilizing highly flexible sequence models such as Transformers to engineer superior optimization strategies, and enhancing performance prediction over previously unseen search spaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2024</p></details> |

| **[Federated Adaptation for Foundation Model-based Recommendations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04840v1)** | 2024-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the recent success of large language models, particularly foundation models with generalization abilities, applying foundation models for recommendations becomes a new paradigm to improve existing recommendation systems. It becomes a new open challenge to enable the foundation model to capture user preference changes in a timely manner with reasonable communication and computation costs while preserving privacy. This paper proposes a novel federated adaptation mechanism to enhance the foundation model-based recommendation system in a privacy-preserving manner. Specifically, each client will learn a lightweight personalized adapter using its private data. The adapter then collaborates with pre-trained foundation models to provide recommendation service efficiently with fine-grained manners. Importantly, users' private behavioral data remains secure as it is not shared with the server. This data localization-based privacy preservation is embodied via the federated learning framework. The model can ensure that shared knowledge is incorporated into all adapters while simultaneously preserving each user's personal preferences. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate our method's superior performance. Implementation code is available to ease reproducibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a regular paper of IJCAI'24</p></details> |

The rapid advances in FMs serve as an important contextual backdrop for the vision of next-generation wireless networks, where federated learning (FL) is a key enabler of distributed network intelligence. Currently, the exploration of the interplay between FMs and FL is still in its nascent stage. Naturally, FMs are capable of boosting the performance of FL, and FL could also leverage decentralized data and computing resources to assist in the training of FMs. However, the exceptionally high requirements that FMs have for computing resources, storage, and communication overhead would pose critical challenges to FL-enabled wireless networks. In this article, we explore the extent to which FMs are suitable for FL over wireless networks, including a broad overview of research challenges and opportunities.

Traditional time series models are task-specific, featuring singular functionality and limited generalization capacity. Recently, large language foundation models have unveiled their remarkable capabilities for cross-task transferability, zero-shot/few-shot learning, and decision-making explainability. This success has sparked interest in the exploration of foundation models to solve multiple time series challenges simultaneously. There are two main research lines, namely pre-training foundation models from scratch for time series and adapting large language foundation models for time series. They both contribute to the development of a unified model that is highly generalizable, versatile, and comprehensible for time series analysis. This survey offers a 3E analytical framework for comprehensive examination of related research. Specifically, we examine existing works from three dimensions, namely Effectiveness, Efficiency and Explainability. In each dimension, we focus on discussing how related works devise tailored solution by considering unique challenges in the realm of time series. Furthermore, we provide a domain taxonomy to help followers keep up with the domain-specific advancements. In addition, we introduce extensive resources to facilitate the field's development, including datasets, open-source, time series libraries.

Leveraging large-scale datasets and powerful models, ViFMs achieve this by capturing robust and generic features from video data. This survey analyzes over 200 video foundational models, offering a comprehensive overview of benchmarks and evaluation metrics across 14 distinct video tasks categorized into 3 main categories. Additionally, we offer an in-depth performance analysis of these models for the 6 most common video tasks. We categorize ViFMs into three categories: 1) Image-based ViFMs, which adapt existing image models for video tasks, 2) Video-Based ViFMs, which utilize video-specific encoding methods, and 3) Universal Foundational Models (UFMs), which combine multiple modalities (image, video, audio, and text etc.) within a single framework. By comparing the performance of various ViFMs on different tasks, this survey offers valuable insights into their strengths and weaknesses, guiding future advancements in video understanding. Our analysis surprisingly reveals that image-based foundation models consistently outperform video-based models on most video understanding tasks. Additionally, UFMs, which leverage diverse modalities, demonstrate superior performance on video tasks.

We introduce a novel approach to create accurate, sparse foundational versions of performant LLMs that achieve full accuracy recovery for fine-tuning tasks at up to 70% sparsity. We achieve this for the LLaMA-2 7B model by combining the SparseGPT one-shot pruning method and sparse pretraining of those models on a subset of the SlimPajama dataset mixed with a Python subset of The Stack dataset. We exhibit training acceleration due to sparsity on Cerebras CS-3 chips that closely matches theoretical scaling. In addition, we establish inference acceleration of up to 3x on CPUs by utilizing Neural Magic's DeepSparse engine and 1.7x on GPUs through Neural Magic's nm-vllm engine. The above gains are realized via sparsity alone, thus enabling further gains through additional use of quantization. Specifically, we show a total speedup on CPUs for sparse-quantized LLaMA models of up to 8.6x. We demonstrate these results across diverse, challenging tasks, including chat, instruction following, code generation, arithmetic reasoning, and summarization to prove their generality. This work paves the way for rapidly creating smaller and faster LLMs without sacrificing accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, we implement Scholar Hero, a real-world instantiation of FOKE. Our research highlights the potential of integrating foundation models, knowledge graphs, and prompt engineering to revolutionize intelligent education practices, ultimately benefiting learners worldwide.

| **[Towards Causal Foundation Model: on Duality between Causal Inference and Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00809v2)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have brought changes to the landscape of machine learning, demonstrating sparks of human-level intelligence across a diverse array of tasks. However, a gap persists in complex tasks such as causal inference, primarily due to challenges associated with intricate reasoning steps and high numerical precision requirements. In this work, we take a first step towards building causally-aware foundation models for complex tasks. We propose a novel, theoretically sound method called Causal Inference with Attention (CInA), which utilizes multiple unlabeled datasets to perform self-supervised causal learning, and subsequently enables zero-shot causal inference on unseen tasks with new data. This is based on our theoretical results that demonstrate the primal-dual connection between optimal covariate balancing and self-attention, facilitating zero-shot causal inference through the final layer of a trained transformer-type architecture. We demonstrate empirically that our approach CInA effectively generalizes to out-of-distribution datasets and various real-world datasets, matching or even surpassing traditional per-dataset causal inference methodologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[LMFlow: An Extensible Toolkit for Finetuning and Inference of Large Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12420v2)** | 2024-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have demonstrated a great ability to achieve general human-level intelligence far beyond traditional approaches. As the technique keeps attracting attention from the AI community, an increasing number of foundation models are becoming publicly accessible. However, a significant shortcoming of most of these models lies in their performance in specialized-domain and task-specific applications, necessitating domain- and task-aware fine-tuning to develop effective scientific language models. As the number of available foundation models and specialized tasks keeps growing, the job of training scientific language models becomes highly nontrivial. In this paper, we initiate steps to tackle this issue. We introduce an extensible and lightweight toolkit, LMFlow, which aims to simplify the domain- and task-aware finetuning of general foundation models. LMFlow offers a complete finetuning workflow for a foundation model to support specialized training with limited computing resources. Furthermore, it supports continuous pretraining, instruction tuning, parameter-efficient finetuning, alignment tuning, inference acceleration, long context generalization, model customization, and even multimodal finetuning, along with carefully designed and extensible APIs.

To this end, we present Foundation Model Embedded Gaussian Splatting (FMGS), which incorporates vision-language embeddings of foundation models into 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS). The key contribution of this work is an efficient method to reconstruct and represent 3D vision-language models. This is achieved by distilling feature maps generated from image-based foundation models into those rendered from our 3D model. To ensure high-quality rendering and fast training, we introduce a novel scene representation by integrating strengths from both GS and multi-resolution hash encodings (MHE). Our effective training procedure also introduces a pixel alignment loss that makes the rendered feature distance of the same semantic entities close, following the pixel-level semantic boundaries. Our results demonstrate remarkable multi-view semantic consistency, facilitating diverse downstream tasks, beating state-of-the-art methods by 10.2 percent on open-vocabulary language-based object detection, despite that we are 851X faster for inference. This research explores the intersection of vision, language, and 3D scene representation, paving the way for enhanced scene understanding in uncontrolled real-world environments.

| **[Automating the Enterprise with Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03710v1)** | 2024-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automating enterprise workflows could unlock $4 trillion/year in productivity gains. Despite being of interest to the data management community for decades, the ultimate vision of end-to-end workflow automation has remained elusive. Current solutions rely on process mining and robotic process automation (RPA), in which a bot is hard-coded to follow a set of predefined rules for completing a workflow. Through case studies of a hospital and large B2B enterprise, we find that the adoption of RPA has been inhibited by high set-up costs (12-18 months), unreliable execution (60% initial accuracy), and burdensome maintenance (requiring multiple FTEs). Multimodal foundation models (FMs) such as GPT-4 offer a promising new approach for end-to-end workflow automation given their generalized reasoning and planning abilities. To study these capabilities we propose ECLAIR, a system to automate enterprise workflows with minimal human supervision. We conduct initial experiments showing that multimodal FMs can address the limitations of traditional RPA with (1) near-human-level understanding of workflows (93% accuracy on a workflow understanding task) and (2) instant set-up with minimal technical barrier (based solely on a natural language description of a workflow, ECLAIR achieves end-to-end completion rates of 40%). We identify human-AI collaboration, validation, and self-improvement as open challenges, and suggest ways they can be solved with data management techniques.

Conventional panoptic mapping methods, however, are limited by predefined semantic classes, thus making them ineffective for handling novel or unforeseen objects. In response to this limitation, we introduce the Unified Promptable Panoptic Mapping (UPPM) method. UPPM utilizes recent advances in foundation models to enable real-time, on-demand label generation using natural language prompts. By incorporating a dynamic labeling strategy into traditional panoptic mapping techniques, UPPM provides significant improvements in adaptability and versatility while maintaining high performance levels in map reconstruction. We demonstrate our approach on real-world and simulated datasets. Results show that UPPM can accurately reconstruct scenes and segment objects while generating rich semantic labels through natural language interactions. A series of ablation experiments validated the advantages of foundation model-based labeling over fixed label sets.</p></details> |  |

However, the existing world models rely solely on statistical learning of how observations change in response to actions, lacking precise quantification of how accurate the surrogate dynamics are, which poses a significant challenge in safety-critical systems. To address this challenge, we propose foundation world models that embed observations into meaningful and causally latent representations. This enables the surrogate dynamics to directly predict causal future states by leveraging a training-free large language model. In two common benchmarks, this novel model outperforms standard world models in the safety prediction task and has a performance comparable to supervised learning despite not using any data. We evaluate its performance with a more specialized and system-relevant metric by comparing estimated states instead of aggregating observation-wide error.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the Back to the Future-Robot Learning Going Probabilistic Workshop, co-located with ICRA 2024. https://openreview.net/forum?id=gHhBNIq9Cs</p></details> |

In this position piece we aim to shift the ML research community's priorities ever so slightly to a different modality: tabular data. Tabular data is the dominant modality in many fields, yet it is given hardly any research attention and significantly lags behind in terms of scale and power. We believe the time is now to start developing tabular foundation models, or what we coin a Large Tabular Model (LTM). LTMs could revolutionise the way science and ML use tabular data: not as single datasets that are analyzed in a vacuum, but contextualized with respect to related datasets. The potential impact is far-reaching: from few-shot tabular models to automating data science; from out-of-distribution synthetic data to empowering multidisciplinary scientific discovery. We intend to excite reflections on the modalities we study, and convince some researchers to study large tabular models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024)</p></details> |

In the real world, spatial understanding is often an ill-posed problem. There are a number of powerful classical methods that accurately regress relative pose, however, these approaches often lack the ability to leverage data-derived priors to resolve ambiguities. In multi-robot systems, these challenges are exacerbated by the need for accurate and frequent position estimates of cooperating agents. To this end, we propose CoViS-Net, a cooperative, multi-robot, visual spatial foundation model that learns spatial priors from data. Unlike prior work evaluated primarily on offline datasets, we design our model specifically for online evaluation and real-world deployment on cooperative robots. Our model is completely decentralized, platform agnostic, executable in real-time using onboard compute, and does not require existing network infrastructure. In this work, we focus on relative pose estimation and local Bird's Eye View (BEV) prediction tasks. Unlike classical approaches, we show that our model can accurately predict relative poses without requiring camera overlap, and predict BEVs of regions not visible to the ego-agent. We demonstrate our model on a multi-robot formation control task outside the confines of the laboratory.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by human sensorimotor adaptation mechanisms, we aim to train encoder-decoder networks that can be commonly used to learn novel motor skills in a single movement category. To train the policy network, we develop the multitask reinforcement learning method, where the policy needs to cope with changes in goals or environments with different reward functions or physical parameters of the environment in dynamic movement generation tasks. Here, as a concrete task, we evaluated the proposed method with the ball heading task using a monopod robot model. The results showed that the proposed method could adapt to novel target positions or inexperienced ball restitution coefficients. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the acquired foundational policy network originally learned for heading motion, can be used to generate an entirely new overhead kicking skill.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

VFMs like CLIP, DINOv2, SAM are trained with distinct objectives, exhibiting unique characteristics for various downstream tasks. We find that despite their conceptual differences, these models can be effectively merged into a unified model through multi-teacher distillation. We name this approach AM-RADIO (Agglomerative Model -- Reduce All Domains Into One). This integrative approach not only surpasses the performance of individual teacher models but also amalgamates their distinctive features, such as zero-shot vision-language comprehension, detailed pixel-level understanding, and open vocabulary segmentation capabilities. In pursuit of the most hardware-efficient backbone, we evaluated numerous architectures in our multi-teacher distillation pipeline using the same training recipe. This led to the development of a novel architecture (E-RADIO) that exceeds the performance of its predecessors and is at least 7x faster than the teacher models.
