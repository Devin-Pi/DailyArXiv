| **[GeoRSMLLM: A Multimodal Large Language Model for Vision-Language Tasks in Geoscience and Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12490v1)** | 2025-03-16 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.12490v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing (RS) has demonstrated significant potential in traditional tasks such as scene classification, object detection, and image captioning. However, current models, which excel in Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), struggle with tasks involving complex instructions (e.g., exists multiple conditions) or pixel-level operations like segmentation and change detection. In this white paper, we provide a comprehensive hierarchical summary of vision-language tasks in RS, categorized by the varying levels of cognitive capability required. We introduce the Remote Sensing Vision-Language Task Set (RSVLTS), which includes Open-Vocabulary Tasks (OVT), Referring Expression Tasks (RET), and Described Object Tasks (DOT) with increased difficulty, and Visual Question Answering (VQA) aloneside. Moreover, we propose a novel unified data representation using a set-of-points approach for RSVLTS, along with a condition parser and a self-augmentation strategy based on cyclic referring. These features are integrated into the GeoRSMLLM model, and this enhanced model is designed to handle a broad range of tasks of RSVLTS, paving the way for a more generalized solution for vision-language tasks in geoscience and remote sensing.</p></details> |  |

Geoscience foundation models (GFMs) emerge as a paradigm-shifting solution, integrating extensive cross-disciplinary data to enhance the simulation and understanding of Earth system dynamics. These data-centric AI models extract insights from petabytes of structured and unstructured data, effectively addressing the complexities of Earth systems that traditional models struggle to capture. The unique strengths of GFMs include flexible task specification, diverse input-output capabilities, and multi-modal knowledge representation, enabling analyses that surpass those of individual data sources or traditional AI methods. This review not only highlights the key advantages of GFMs, but also presents essential techniques for their construction, with a focus on transformers, pre-training, and adaptation strategies. Subsequently, we examine recent advancements in GFMs, including large language models, vision models, and vision-language models, particularly emphasizing the potential applications in remote sensing. Additionally, the review concludes with a comprehensive analysis of the challenges and future trends in GFMs, addressing five critical aspects: data integration, model complexity, uncertainty quantification, interdisciplinary collaboration, and concerns related to privacy, trust, and security. This review offers a comprehensive overview of emerging geoscientific research paradigms, emphasizing the untapped opportunities at the intersection of advanced AI techniques and geoscience. It examines major methodologies, showcases advances in large-scale models, and discusses the challenges and prospects that will shape the future landscape of GFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accpe...</summary><p>accpeted by IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Magazine</p></details> |

In this work, we discuss a series of developments in the field of prototype-based XAI that show potential for scientific learning tasks, with a focus on the geosciences. We organize the prototype-based XAI literature into three themes: the development and visualization of prototypes, types of prototypes, and the use of prototypes in various learning tasks. We discuss how the authors use prototype-based methods, their novel contributions, and any limitations or challenges that may arise when adapting these methods for geoscientific learning tasks. We highlight differences between geoscientific data sets and the standard benchmarks used to develop XAI methods, and discuss how specific geoscientific applications may benefit from using or modifying existing prototype-based XAI techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AI for Science Workshop-Oral (Attention Track), Proceedings of 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Interpretable Geoscience Artificial Intelligence (XGeoS-AI): Application to Demystify Image Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04940v2)** | 2024-05-07 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2311.04940v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Earth science enters the era of big data, artificial intelligence (AI) not only offers great potential for solving geoscience problems, but also plays a critical role in accelerating the understanding of the complex, interactive, and multiscale processes of Earth's behavior. As geoscience AI models are progressively utilized for significant predictions in crucial situations, geoscience researchers are increasingly demanding their interpretability and versatility. This study proposes an interpretable geoscience artificial intelligence (XGeoS-AI) framework to unravel the mystery of image recognition in the Earth sciences, and its effectiveness and versatility is demonstrated by taking computed tomography (CT) image recognition as an example. Inspired by the mechanism of human vision, the proposed XGeoS-AI framework generates a threshold value from a local region within the whole image to complete the recognition. Different kinds of artificial intelligence (AI) methods, such as Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), can be adopted as the AI engines of the proposed XGeoS-AI framework to efficiently complete geoscience image recognition tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the effectiveness, versatility, and heuristics of the proposed framework have great potential in solving geoscience image recognition problems. Interpretable AI should receive more and more attention in the field of the Earth sciences, which is the key to promoting more rational and wider applications of AI in the field of Earth sciences. In addition, the proposed interpretable framework may be the forerunner of technological innovation in the Earth sciences.</p></details> | <details><summary>there...</summary><p>there are some erros in the results, and a newer revision is still preparing</p></details> |
| **[GeoGalactica: A Scientific Large Language Model in Geoscience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00434v2)** | 2024-04-13 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2401.00434v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved huge success for their general knowledge and ability to solve a wide spectrum of tasks in natural language processing (NLP). Due to their impressive abilities, LLMs have shed light on potential inter-discipline applications to foster scientific discoveries of a specific domain by using artificial intelligence (AI for science, AI4S). In the meantime, utilizing NLP techniques in geoscience research and practice is wide and convoluted, contributing from knowledge extraction and document classification to question answering and knowledge discovery. In this work, we take the initial step to leverage LLM for science, through a rather straightforward approach. We try to specialize an LLM into geoscience, by further pre-training the model with a vast amount of texts in geoscience, as well as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) the resulting model with our custom collected instruction tuning dataset. These efforts result in a model GeoGalactica consisting of 30 billion parameters. To our best knowledge, it is the largest language model for the geoscience domain. More specifically, GeoGalactica is from further pre-training of Galactica. We train GeoGalactica over a geoscience-related text corpus containing 65 billion tokens, preserving as the largest geoscience-specific text corpus. Then we fine-tune the model with 1 million pairs of instruction-tuning data consisting of questions that demand professional geoscience knowledge to answer. In this technical report, we will illustrate in detail all aspects of GeoGalactica, including data collection, data cleaning, base model selection, pre-training, SFT, and evaluation. We open-source our data curation tools and the checkpoints of GeoGalactica during the first 3/4 of pre-training.</p></details> |  |
| **[A novel approach for estimating functions in the multivariate setting based on an adaptive knot selection for B-splines with an application to a chemical system used in geoscience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00686v3)** | 2024-01-25 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2306.00686v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we will outline a novel data-driven method for estimating functions in a multivariate nonparametric regression model based on an adaptive knot selection for B-splines. The underlying idea of our approach for selecting knots is to apply the generalized lasso, since the knots of the B-spline basis can be seen as changes in the derivatives of the function to be estimated. This method was then extended to functions depending on several variables by processing each dimension independently, thus reducing the problem to a univariate setting. The regularization parameters were chosen by means of a criterion based on EBIC. The nonparametric estimator was obtained using a multivariate B-spline regression with the corresponding selected knots. Our procedure was validated through numerical experiments by varying the number of observations and the level of noise to investigate its robustness. The influence of observation sampling was also assessed and our method was applied to a chemical system commonly used in geoscience. For each different framework considered in this paper, our approach performed better than state-of-the-art methods. Our completely data-driven method is implemented in the glober R package which is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).</p></details> | 29 pages, 27 figures |
| **[When Geoscience Meets Generative AI and Large Language Models: Foundations, Trends, and Future Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03349v1)** | 2024-01-25 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2402.03349v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) represents an emerging field that promises the creation of synthetic data and outputs in different modalities. GAI has recently shown impressive results across a large spectrum of applications ranging from biology, medicine, education, legislation, computer science, and finance. As one strives for enhanced safety, efficiency, and sustainability, generative AI indeed emerges as a key differentiator and promises a paradigm shift in the field. This paper explores the potential applications of generative AI and large language models in geoscience. The recent developments in the field of machine learning and deep learning have enabled the generative model's utility for tackling diverse prediction problems, simulation, and multi-criteria decision-making challenges related to geoscience and Earth system dynamics. This survey discusses several GAI models that have been used in geoscience comprising generative adversarial networks (GANs), physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), and generative pre-trained transformer (GPT)-based structures. These tools have helped the geoscience community in several applications, including (but not limited to) data generation/augmentation, super-resolution, panchromatic sharpening, haze removal, restoration, and land surface changing. Some challenges still remain such as ensuring physical interpretation, nefarious use cases, and trustworthiness. Beyond that, GAI models show promises to the geoscience community, especially with the support to climate change, urban science, atmospheric science, marine science, and planetary science through their extraordinary ability to data-driven modeling and uncertainty quantification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentiable modeling to unify machine learning and physical models and advance Geosciences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04027v2)** | 2023-12-27 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2301.04027v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Process-Based Modeling (PBM) and Machine Learning (ML) are often perceived as distinct paradigms in the geosciences. Here we present differentiable geoscientific modeling as a powerful pathway toward dissolving the perceived barrier between them and ushering in a paradigm shift. For decades, PBM offered benefits in interpretability and physical consistency but struggled to efficiently leverage large datasets. ML methods, especially deep networks, presented strong predictive skills yet lacked the ability to answer specific scientific questions. While various methods have been proposed for ML-physics integration, an important underlying theme -- differentiable modeling -- is not sufficiently recognized. Here we outline the concepts, applicability, and significance of differentiable geoscientific modeling (DG). "Differentiable" refers to accurately and efficiently calculating gradients with respect to model variables, critically enabling the learning of high-dimensional unknown relationships. DG refers to a range of methods connecting varying amounts of prior knowledge to neural networks and training them together, capturing a different scope than physics-guided machine learning and emphasizing first principles. Preliminary evidence suggests DG offers better interpretability and causality than ML, improved generalizability and extrapolation capability, and strong potential for knowledge discovery, while approaching the performance of purely data-driven ML. DG models require less training data while scaling favorably in performance and efficiency with increasing amounts of data. With DG, geoscientists may be better able to frame and investigate questions, test hypotheses, and discover unrecognized linkages.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we bring LLMs to the realm of geoscience with the objective of advancing research and applications in this field. To this end, we present the first-ever LLM in geoscience, K2, alongside a suite of resources developed to further promote LLM research within geoscience. For instance, we have curated the first geoscience instruction tuning dataset, GeoSignal, which aims to align LLM responses to geoscience-related user queries. Additionally, we have established the first geoscience benchmark, GeoBench, to evaluate LLMs in the context of geoscience. In this work, we experiment with a complete recipe to adapt a pre-trained general-domain LLM to the geoscience domain. Specifically, we further train the LLaMA-7B model on 5.5B tokens of geoscience text corpus, including over 1 million pieces of geoscience literature, and utilize GeoSignal's supervised data to fine-tune the model. Moreover, we share a protocol that can efficiently gather domain-specific data and construct domain-supervised data, even in situations where manpower is scarce. Meanwhile, we equip K2 with the abilities of using tools to be a naive geoscience aide. Experiments conducted on the GeoBench demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and datasets on geoscience knowledge understanding and utilization.We open-source all the training data and K2 model checkpoints at https://github.com/davendw49/k2.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI Security for Geoscience and Remote Sensing: Challenges and Future Trends](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09360v2)** | 2023-06-22 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2212.09360v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have significantly intensified research in the geoscience and remote sensing (RS) field. AI algorithms, especially deep learning-based ones, have been developed and applied widely to RS data analysis. The successful application of AI covers almost all aspects of Earth observation (EO) missions, from low-level vision tasks like super-resolution, denoising and inpainting, to high-level vision tasks like scene classification, object detection and semantic segmentation. While AI techniques enable researchers to observe and understand the Earth more accurately, the vulnerability and uncertainty of AI models deserve further attention, considering that many geoscience and RS tasks are highly safety-critical. This paper reviews the current development of AI security in the geoscience and RS field, covering the following five important aspects: adversarial attack, backdoor attack, federated learning, uncertainty and explainability. Moreover, the potential opportunities and trends are discussed to provide insights for future research. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to provide a systematic review of AI security-related research in the geoscience and RS community. Available code and datasets are also listed in the paper to move this vibrant field of research forward.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coarse-to-fine Task-driven Inpainting for Geoscience Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11059v3)** | 2022-12-06 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2211.11059v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The processing and recognition of geoscience images have wide applications. Most of existing researches focus on understanding the high-quality geoscience images by assuming that all the images are clear. However, in many real-world cases, the geoscience images might contain occlusions during the image acquisition. This problem actually implies the image inpainting problem in computer vision and multimedia. To the best of our knowledge, all the existing image inpainting algorithms learn to repair the occluded regions for a better visualization quality, they are excellent for natural images but not good enough for geoscience images by ignoring the geoscience related tasks. This paper aims to repair the occluded regions for a better geoscience task performance with the advanced visualization quality simultaneously, without changing the current deployed deep learning based geoscience models. Because of the complex context of geoscience images, we propose a coarse-to-fine encoder-decoder network with coarse-to-fine adversarial context discriminators to reconstruct the occluded image regions. Due to the limited data of geoscience images, we use a MaskMix based data augmentation method to exploit more information from limited geoscience image data. The experimental results on three public geoscience datasets for remote sensing scene recognition, cross-view geolocation and semantic segmentation tasks respectively show the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating the fidelity of explainable artificial intelligence methods for applications of convolutional neural networks in geoscience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03407v2)** | 2022-09-05 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2202.03407v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently attracted great attention in geoscience due to their ability to capture non-linear system behavior and extract predictive spatiotemporal patterns. Given their black-box nature however, and the importance of prediction explainability, methods of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) are gaining popularity as a means to explain the CNN decision-making strategy. Here, we establish an intercomparison of some of the most popular XAI methods and investigate their fidelity in explaining CNN decisions for geoscientific applications. Our goal is to raise awareness of the theoretical limitations of these methods and gain insight into the relative strengths and weaknesses to help guide best practices. The considered XAI methods are first applied to an idealized attribution benchmark, where the ground truth of explanation of the network is known a priori, to help objectively assess their performance. Secondly, we apply XAI to a climate-related prediction setting, namely to explain a CNN that is trained to predict the number of atmospheric rivers in daily snapshots of climate simulations. Our results highlight several important issues of XAI methods (e.g., gradient shattering, inability to distinguish the sign of attribution, ignorance to zero input) that have previously been overlooked in our field and, if not considered cautiously, may lead to a distorted picture of the CNN decision-making strategy. We envision that our analysis will motivate further investigation into XAI fidelity and will help towards a cautious implementation of XAI in geoscience, which can lead to further exploitation of CNNs and deep learning for prediction problems.</p></details> |  |

However, the predominant reliance on visual encoding of data continues to create accessibility barriers for people who are blind/vision impaired resulting in their under representation in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. This research study seeks to understand the experiences of professionals who are blind/vision impaired in one such STEM discipline (geosciences) in accessing data visualizations. In-depth, semi-structured interviews with seven professionals were conducted to examine the accessibility barriers and areas for improvement to inform accessibility research pertaining to data visualizations through a socio-technical lens. A reflexive thematic analysis revealed the negative impact of visualizations in influencing their career path, lack of data exploration tools for research, barriers in accessing works of peers and mismatched pace of visualization and accessibility research. The article also includes recommendations from the participants to address some of these accessibility barriers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Network Attribution Methods for Problems in Geoscience: A Novel Synthetic Benchmark Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10005v2)** | 2022-06-10 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2103.10005v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the increasingly successful application of neural networks to many problems in the geosciences, their complex and nonlinear structure makes the interpretation of their predictions difficult, which limits model trust and does not allow scientists to gain physical insights about the problem at hand. Many different methods have been introduced in the emerging field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which aim at attributing the network s prediction to specific features in the input domain. XAI methods are usually assessed by using benchmark datasets (like MNIST or ImageNet for image classification). However, an objective, theoretically derived ground truth for the attribution is lacking for most of these datasets, making the assessment of XAI in many cases subjective. Also, benchmark datasets specifically designed for problems in geosciences are rare. Here, we provide a framework, based on the use of additively separable functions, to generate attribution benchmark datasets for regression problems for which the ground truth of the attribution is known a priori. We generate a large benchmark dataset and train a fully connected network to learn the underlying function that was used for simulation. We then compare estimated heatmaps from different XAI methods to the ground truth in order to identify examples where specific XAI methods perform well or poorly. We believe that attribution benchmarks as the ones introduced herein are of great importance for further application of neural networks in the geosciences, and for more objective assessment and accurate implementation of XAI methods, which will increase model trust and assist in discovering new science.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an updated preprint version of the manuscript.

Quantifying complexity and non-stationarity of these data is a challenging task, and advanced complexity-based exploratory tool are required for understanding and visualizing such data. This paper discusses the Fisher-Shannon method, from which one can obtain a complexity measure and detect non-stationarity, as an efficient data exploration tool. The state-of-the-art studies related to the Fisher-Shannon measures are collected, and new analytical formulas for positive unimodal skewed distributions are proposed. Case studies on both synthetic and real data illustrate the usefulness of the Fisher-Shannon method, which can find application in different domains including time series discrimination and generation of times series features for clustering, modeling and forecasting. The paper is accompanied with Python and R libraries for the non-parametric estimation of the proposed measures.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

In remote sensing and geosciences this is of special relevance to better understand the Earth's system and the complex interactions between the governing processes. In this paper, we focus on observational causal inference, thus we try to estimate the correct direction of causation using a finite set of empirical data. In addition, we focus on the more complex bivariate scenario that requires strong assumptions and no conditional independence tests can be used. In particular, we explore the framework of (non-deterministic) additive noise models, which relies on the principle of independence between the cause and the generating mechanism. A practical algorithmic instantiation of such principle only requires 1) two regression models in the forward and backward directions, and 2) the estimation of {\em statistical independence} between the obtained residuals and the observations. The direction leading to more independent residuals is decided to be the cause. We instead propose a criterion that uses the {\em sensitivity} (derivative) of the dependence estimator, the sensitivity criterion allows to identify samples most affecting the dependence measure, and hence the criterion is robust to spurious detections. We illustrate performance in a collection of 28 geoscience causal inference problems, in a database of radiative transfer models simulations and machine learning emulators in vegetation parameter modeling involving 182 problems, and in assessing the impact of different regression models in a carbon cycle problem. The criterion achieves state-of-the-art detection rates in all cases, it is generally robust to noise sources and distortions.</p></details> |  |

We propose to focus on the sensitivity (curvature) of the dependence estimator to account for the asymmetry of the forward and inverse densities of approximation residuals.

A thorough analysis of the co-developments of machine learning applications throughout the last 70 years relates the recent enthusiasm for machine learning to developments in geoscience. I explore the shift of kriging towards a mainstream machine learning method and the historic application of neural networks in geoscience, following the general trend of machine learning enthusiasm through the decades. Furthermore, this chapter explores the shift from mathematical fundamentals and knowledge in software development towards skills in model validation, applied statistics, and integrated subject matter expertise. The review is interspersed with code examples to complement the theoretical foundations and illustrate model validation and machine learning explainability for science. The scope of this review includes various shallow machine learning methods, e.g. Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support-Vector Machines, and Gaussian Processes, as well as, deep neural networks, including feed-forward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks and generative adversarial networks. Regarding geoscience, the review has a bias towards geophysics but aims to strike a balance with geochemistry, geostatistics, and geology, however excludes remote sensing, as this would exceed the scope. In general, I aim to provide context for the recent enthusiasm surrounding deep learning with respect to research, hardware, and software developments that enable successful application of shallow and deep machine learning in all disciplines of Earth science.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 17 figures, book chapter</p></details> |

As such, neural networks have often been used within the geosciences to most accurately identify a desired output given a set of inputs, with the interpretation of what the network learns used as a secondary metric to ensure the network is making the right decision for the right reason. Neural network interpretation techniques have become more advanced in recent years, however, and we therefore propose that the ultimate objective of using a neural network can also be the interpretation of what the network has learned rather than the output itself. We show that the interpretation of neural networks can enable the discovery of scientifically meaningful connections within geoscientific data. In particular, we use two methods for neural network interpretation called backwards optimization and layerwise relevance propagation, both of which project the decision pathways of a network back onto the original input dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, LRP has not yet been applied to geoscientific research, and we believe it has great potential in this area.

Such extreme quantities of generated and modeled data greatly impact computational performances on many levels of high-performance computing (HPC): storage media, memory requirements, transfer capability, and finally simulation interactivity, necessary to exploit this instance of big data. Efficient representations and storage are thus becoming "enabling technologies'' in HPC experimental and simulation science. We propose HexaShrink, an original decomposition scheme for structured hexahedral volume meshes. The latter are used for instance in biomedical engineering, materials science, or geosciences. HexaShrink provides a comprehensive framework allowing efficient mesh visualization and storage. Its exactly reversible multiresolution decomposition yields a hierarchy of meshes of increasing levels of details, in terms of either geometry, continuous or categorical properties of cells. Starting with an overview of volume meshes compression techniques, our contribution blends coherently different multiresolution wavelet schemes in different dimensions. It results in a global framework preserving discontinuities (faults) across scales, implemented as a fully reversible upscaling at different resolutions. Experimental results are provided on meshes of varying size and complexity. They emphasize the consistency of the proposed representation, in terms of visualization, attribute downsampling and distribution at different resolutions. Finally, HexaShrink yields gains in storage space when combined to lossless compression techniques.</p></details> |  |

They have been applied in numerous science areas, but their application to the geosciences has been limited due to their inefficiency in high-dimensional systems in standard settings. However, huge progress has been made, and this limitation is disappearing fast due to recent developments in proposal densities, the use of ideas from (optimal) transportation, the use of localisation and intelligent adaptive resampling strategies. Furthermore, powerful hybrids between particle filters and ensemble Kalman filters and variational methods have been developed. We present a state of the art discussion of present efforts of developing particle filters for highly nonlinear geoscience state-estimation problems with an emphasis on atmospheric and oceanic applications, including many new ideas, derivations, and unifications, highlighting hidden connections, and generating a valuable tool and guide for the community. Initial experiments show that particle filters can be competitive with present-day methods for numerical weather prediction suggesting that they will become mainstream soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revie...</summary><p>Review paper, 36 pages, 9 figures, Resubmitted to Q.J.Royal Meteorol.

A rigorous statistical analysis of such observations is tricky, though. Observables can span several orders of magnitude, but the range for which the power law may be valid is typically truncated, usually because the smallest events are too tiny to be detected and the largest ones are limited by the system size. We revisit several examples of proposed power-law distributions dealing with potentially damaging natural phenomena. Adequate fits of the distributions of sizes are especially important in these cases, given that they may be used to assess long-term hazard. After reviewing the theoretical background for power-law distributions, we improve an objective statistical fitting method and apply it to diverse data sets. The method is described in full detail and it is easy to implement. Our analysis elucidates the range of validity of the power-law fit and the corresponding exponent, and whether a power-law tail is improved by a truncated log-normal. We confirm that impact fireballs and Californian earthquakes show untruncated power-law behavior, whereas global earthquakes follow a double power law. Rain precipitation over space and time and tropical cyclones show a truncated power-law regime. Karst sinkholes and wildfires, in contrast, are better described by truncated log-normals, although wildfires also may show power-law regimes. Our conclusions only apply to the analyzed data sets, but show the potential of applying this robust statistical technique in the future.</p></details> |  |

This term encompasses the entire sequence of operations that, starting from the observations of a system, and from additional statistical and dynamical information (such as a dynamical evolution model), provides an estimate of its state. Data assimilation is standard practice in numerical weather prediction, but its application is becoming widespread in many other areas of climate, atmosphere, ocean and environment modeling; in all circumstances where one intends to estimate the state of a large dynamical system based on limited information. While the complexity of data assimilation, and of the methods thereof, stands on its interdisciplinary nature across statistics, dynamical systems and numerical optimization, when applied to geosciences an additional difficulty arises by the continually increasing sophistication of the environmental models. Thus, in spite of data assimilation being nowadays ubiquitous in geosciences, it has so far remained a topic mostly reserved to experts. We aim this overview article at geoscientists with a background in mathematical and physical modeling, who are interested in the rapid development of data assimilation and its growing domains of application in environmental science, but so far have not delved into its conceptual and methodological complexities.</p></details> | <details><summary>79 pa...</summary><p>79 pages, 10 figures, Invited review</p></details> |

While prior efforts often rely on explicit 3D inputs or specialized model architectures, we ask: can LMMs reason about 3D space using only structured 2D representations derived from perception? We introduce Struct2D, a perception-guided prompting framework that combines bird's-eye-view (BEV) images with object marks and object-centric metadata, optionally incorporating egocentric keyframes when needed. Using Struct2D, we conduct an in-depth zero-shot analysis of closed-source LMMs (e.g., GPT-o3) and find that they exhibit surprisingly strong spatial reasoning abilities when provided with structured 2D inputs, effectively handling tasks such as relative direction estimation and route planning. Building on these insights, we construct Struct2D-Set, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset with 200K fine-grained QA pairs across eight spatial reasoning categories, generated automatically from 3D indoor scenes. We fine-tune an open-source LMM (Qwen2.5VL) on Struct2D-Set, achieving competitive performance on multiple benchmarks, including 3D question answering, dense captioning, and object grounding. Our approach demonstrates that structured 2D inputs can effectively bridge perception and language reasoning in LMMs-without requiring explicit 3D representations as input. We will release both our code and dataset to support future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/neu-vi/struct2d</p></details> |

Traditional approaches typically rely on registration-based interpolation to generate intermediate frames. However, these methods struggle with large deformations, resulting in misregistration, artifacts, and diminished spatial consistency. To address these challenges, we propose TSSC-Net, a novel framework that generates intermediate frames while preserving spatial consistency. To improve temporal fidelity under fast motion, our diffusion-based temporal super-resolution network generates intermediate frames using the start and end frames as key references, achieving 6x temporal super-resolution in a single inference step. Additionally, we introduce a novel tri-directional Mamba-based module that leverages long-range contextual information to effectively resolve spatial inconsistencies arising from cross-slice misalignment, thereby enhancing volumetric coherence and correcting cross-slice errors. Extensive experiments were performed on the public ACDC cardiac MRI dataset and a real-world dynamic 4D knee joint dataset. The results demonstrate that TSSC-Net can generate high-resolution dynamic MRI from fast-motion data while preserving structural fidelity and spatial consistency.</p></details> |  |

| **[SEM: Enhancing Spatial Understanding for Robust Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16196v2)** | 2025-06-04 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2505.16196v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key challenge in robot manipulation lies in developing policy models with strong spatial understanding, the ability to reason about 3D geometry, object relations, and robot embodiment. Existing methods often fall short: 3D point cloud models lack semantic abstraction, while 2D image encoders struggle with spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose SEM (Spatial Enhanced Manipulation model), a novel diffusion-based policy framework that explicitly enhances spatial understanding from two complementary perspectives. A spatial enhancer augments visual representations with 3D geometric context, while a robot state encoder captures embodiment-aware structure through graphbased modeling of joint dependencies. By integrating these modules, SEM significantly improves spatial understanding, leading to robust and generalizable manipulation across diverse tasks that outperform existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods face spatial uncertainty and data scarcity, limiting the 3D spatial reasoning capability of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). To address these challenges, we present a unified framework for enhancing 3D spatial reasoning in pre-trained VLMs without modifying their architecture. This framework combines SpatialMind, a structured prompting strategy that decomposes complex scenes and questions into interpretable reasoning steps, with ScanForgeQA, a scalable question-answering dataset built from diverse 3D simulation scenes through an automated construction process designed for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the individual and combined effectiveness of our prompting and fine-tuning strategies, and yield insights that may inspire future research on visual-spatial understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing FPGA and Wafer Test Coverage with Spatial Sampling and Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03556v1)** | 2025-06-04 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.03556v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In semiconductor manufacturing, testing costs remain significantly high, especially during wafer and FPGA testing. To reduce the number of required tests while maintaining predictive accuracy, this study investigates three baseline sampling strategies: Random Sampling, Stratified Sampling, and k-means Clustering Sampling. To further enhance these methods, this study proposes a novel algorithm that improves the sampling quality of each approach. This research is conducted using real industrial production data from wafer-level tests and silicon measurements from various FPGAs. This study introduces two hybrid strategies: Stratified with Short Distance Elimination (S-SDE) and k-means with Short Distance Elimination (K-SDE). Their performance is evaluated within the framework of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for predicting wafer and FPGA test data. At the core of our proposed approach is the Short Distance Elimination (SDE) algorithm, which excludes spatially proximate candidate points during sampling, thereby ensuring a more uniform distribution of training data across the physical domain. A parameter sweep was conducted over the (alpha, beta) thresholds, where alpha and beta are in the range {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} and not both zero, to identify the optimal combination that minimizes RMSD. Experimental results on a randomly selected wafer file reveal that (alpha, beta) equal (2, 2) yields the lowest RMSD. Accordingly, all subsequent experiments adopt this parameter configuration. The results demonstrate that the proposed SDE-based strategies enhance predictive accuracy: K-SDE improves upon k-means sampling by 16.26 percent (wafer) and 13.07 percent (FPGA), while S-SDE improves upon stratified sampling by 16.49 percent (wafer) and 8.84 percent (FPGA).</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Fourier Neural Operators with Local Spatial Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17797v2)** | 2025-06-03 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.17797v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial Differential Equation (PDE) problems often exhibit strong local spatial structures, and effectively capturing these structures is critical for approximating their solutions. Recently, the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) has emerged as an efficient approach for solving these PDE problems. By using parametrization in the frequency domain, FNOs can efficiently capture global patterns. However, this approach inherently overlooks the critical role of local spatial features, as frequency-domain parameterized convolutions primarily emphasize global interactions without encoding comprehensive localized spatial dependencies. Although several studies have attempted to address this limitation, their extracted Local Spatial Features (LSFs) remain insufficient, and computational efficiency is often compromised. To address this limitation, we introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based feature pre-extractor to capture LSFs directly from input data, resulting in a hybrid architecture termed \textit{Conv-FNO}. Furthermore, we introduce two novel resizing schemes to make our Conv-FNO resolution invariant. In this work, we focus on demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating LSFs into FNOs by conducting both a theoretical analysis and extensive numerical experiments. Our findings show that this simple yet impactful modification enhances the representational capacity of FNOs and significantly improves performance on challenging PDE benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, on their own LLMs lack reliable spatial reasoning capabilities, especially about distances. To address this problem, we develop a novel approach, DistRAG, that enables an LLM to retrieve relevant spatial information not explicitly learned during training. Our method encodes the geodesic distances between cities and towns in a graph and retrieves a context subgraph relevant to the question. Using this technique, our method enables an LLM to answer distance-based reasoning questions that it otherwise cannot answer. Given the vast array of possible places an LLM could be asked about, DistRAG offers a flexible first step towards providing a rudimentary `world model' to complement the linguistic knowledge held in LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROC Curves for Spatial Point Patterns and Presence-Absence Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03414v1)** | 2025-06-03 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.03414v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves have recently been used to evaluate the performance of models for spatial presence-absence or presence-only data. Applications include species distribution modelling and mineral prospectivity analysis. We clarify the interpretation of the ROC curve in this context. Contrary to statements in the literature, ROC does not measure goodness-of-fit of a spatial model, and its interpretation as a measure of predictive ability is weak; it is a measure of ranking ability, insensitive to the precise form of the model. To gain insight we draw connections between ROC and existing statistical techniques for spatial point pattern data. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is related to hypothesis tests of the null hypothesis that the explanatory variables have no effect. The shape of the ROC curve has a diagnostic interpretation. This suggests several new techniques, which extend the scope of application of ROC curves for spatial data, to support variable selection and model selection, analysis of segregation between different types of points, adjustment for a baseline, and analysis of spatial case-control data. The new techniques are illustrated with several real example datasets. Open source R code implementing the techniques is available in the development version of our package spatstat [Baddeley and Turner, 2005, Baddeley et al., 2015] and will be included in the next public release.</p></details> |  |

Here, we introduce KRONOS, a foundation model built for spatial proteomics. KRONOS was trained in a self-supervised manner on over 47 million image patches covering 175 protein markers, 16 tissue types, and 8 fluorescence-based imaging platforms. We introduce key architectural adaptations to address the high-dimensional, multi-channel, and heterogeneous nature of multiplex imaging. We demonstrate that KRONOS learns biologically meaningful representations across multiple scales, ranging from cellular and microenvironment to tissue levels, enabling it to address diverse downstream tasks, including cell phenotyping, region classification, and patient stratification. Evaluated across 11 independent cohorts, KRONOS achieves state-of-the-art performance across cell phenotyping, treatment response prediction, and retrieval tasks, and is highly data-efficient. KRONOS also introduces the paradigm of segmentation-free patch-level processing for efficient and scalable spatial proteomics analysis, allowing cross-institutional comparisons, and as an image reverse search engine for spatial patterns. Together, these results position KRONOS as a flexible and scalable tool for spatial proteomics. The model is publicly accessible at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/KRONOS.</p></details> |  |

Traditional site selection methods often rely on static traffic counts or subjective assessments. This research introduces a data-driven methodology to objectively quantify location visibility by analyzing large-scale connected vehicle trajectory data (sourced from Compass IoT) within urban environments. We model the dynamic driver field-of-view using a forward-projected visibility area for each vehicle position derived from interpolated trajectories. By integrating this with building vertex locations extracted from OpenStreetMap, we quantify the cumulative visual exposure, or ``visibility count'', for thousands of potential points of interest near roadways. The analysis reveals that visibility is highly concentrated, identifying specific ``visual hotspots'' that receive disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. The core technical contribution involves the construction of a BallTree spatial index over building vertices. This enables highly efficient (O(logN) complexity) radius queries to determine which vertices fall within the viewing circles of millions of trajectory points across numerous trips, significantly outperforming brute-force geometric checks. Analysis reveals two key findings: 1) Visibility is highly concentrated, identifying distinct 'visual hotspots' receiving disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. 2) The aggregated visibility counts across vertices conform to a Log-Normal distribution.</p></details> |  |

Near-miss events captured through vehicle telematics and transmitted in real-time by connected vehicles reveal a unique potential of prevention due to their high frequency nature and driving engagement on the road. There is currently a lack of understanding of the high potential of near-miss data in real-time to proactively detect potential risky driving areas, in advance of a fatal collision. This paper aims to spatially identify clusters of reported accidents (A) versus high-severity near-misses (High-G) within an urban environment (Sydney, Australia) and showcase how the presence of near-misses can significantly lead to future crashes in identified risky hotspots. First, by utilizing a 400m grid framework, we identify significant crash hotspots using the Getis-Ord $G_i^*$ statistical approach. Second, we employ a Bivariate Local Moran's I (LISA) approach to assess and map the spatial concordance and discordance between official crash counts (A) and High-G counts from nearmiss data (High-G). Third, we classify areas based on their joint spatial patterns into: a) High-High (HH) as the most riskiest areas in both historical logs and nearmiss events, High-Low (HL) for high crash logs but low nearmiss records, c) Low-High (LH) for low past crash records but high nearmiss events, and d) Low-Low (LL) for safe areas. Finally, we run a feature importance ranking on all area patterns by using a contextual Point of Interest (POI) count features and we showcase which factors are the most critical to the occurrence of crash blackspots.</p></details> |  |

To solve this problem, we extend the contrastive random walk framework to simultaneously learn cycle-consistent feature representations for both cross-modal and intra-modal matching. The resulting model is simple and has no explicit photo-consistency assumptions. It can be trained entirely using unlabeled data, without the need for any spatially aligned multimodal image pairs. We evaluate our method on both geometric and semantic correspondence tasks. For geometric matching, we consider challenging tasks such as RGB-to-depth and RGB-to-thermal matching (and vice versa); for semantic matching, we evaluate on photo-sketch and cross-style image alignment. Our method achieves strong performance across all benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025. Project link: https://www.ayshrv.com/cmrw .

Compared with general image classification tasks, FBIC poses more formidable challenges: 1) the differences in species size and imaging distance result in the varying sizes of birds presented in the images; 2) complex natural habitats often introduce strong background interference; 3) and highly flexible poses such as flying, perching, or foraging result in substantial intra-class variability. These factors collectively make it difficult for traditional methods to stably extract discriminative features, thereby limiting the generalizability and interpretability of models in real-world applications. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a fine-grained bird classification framework based on strip-aware spatial perception, which aims to capture long-range spatial dependencies across entire rows or columns in bird images, thereby enhancing the model's robustness and interpretability. The proposed method incorporates two novel modules: extensional perception aggregator (EPA) and channel semantic weaving (CSW). Specifically, EPA integrates local texture details with global structural cues by aggregating information across horizontal and vertical spatial directions. CSW further refines the semantic representations by adaptively fusing long-range and short-range information along the channel dimension. Built upon a ResNet-50 backbone, the model enables jump-wise connection of extended structural features across the spatial domain. Experimental results on the CUB-200-2011 dataset demonstrate that our framework achieves significant performance improvements while maintaining architectural efficiency.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces Gaussian and non-Gaussian hierarchical multivariate Mat\'ern-SPDE models with correlated nugget effects to account for small-scale variability and measurement error correlations. Using simulations and Argo data, we demonstrate that incorporating correlated nugget effects significantly improves the accuracy of parameter estimation and spatial prediction in both Gaussian and non-Gaussian multivariate spatial processes. When applied to global ocean temperature and salinity data, our model yields lower correlation estimates between fields compared to models that assume independent noise. This suggests that traditional models may overestimate the underlying field correlation. By separating these effects, our approach captures fine-scale oceanic patterns more effectively. These findings show the importance of relaxing the assumption of independent measurement errors in multivariate hierarchical models.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate whether LLMs implicitly encode linear spatial world models, which we define as linear representations of physical space and object configurations. We introduce a formal framework for spatial world models and assess whether such structure emerges in contextual embeddings. Using a synthetic dataset of object positions, we train probes to decode object positions and evaluate geometric consistency of the underlying space. We further conduct causal interventions to test whether these spatial representations are functionally used by the model.

However, recent studies have exposed critical limitations in their spatial reasoning capabilities. This deficiency in spatial reasoning significantly constrains MLLMs' ability to interact effectively with the physical world, thereby limiting their broader applications. We argue that spatial reasoning capabilities will not naturally emerge from merely scaling existing architectures and training methodologies. Instead, this challenge demands dedicated attention to fundamental modifications in the current MLLM development approach. In this position paper, we first establish a comprehensive framework for spatial reasoning within the context of MLLMs. We then elaborate on its pivotal role in real-world applications. Through systematic analysis, we examine how individual components of the current methodology, from training data to reasoning mechanisms, influence spatial reasoning capabilities. This examination reveals critical limitations while simultaneously identifying promising avenues for advancement. Our work aims to direct the AI research community's attention toward these crucial yet underexplored aspects. By highlighting these challenges and opportunities, we seek to catalyze progress toward achieving human-like spatial reasoning capabilities in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we introduce a novel task, 360V2SA, to generate spatial audio from 360-degree videos, specifically producing First-order Ambisonics (FOA) audio - a standard format for representing 3D spatial audio that captures sound directionality and enables realistic 3D audio reproduction. We first create Sphere360, a novel dataset tailored for this task that is curated from real-world data. We also design an efficient semi-automated pipeline for collecting and cleaning paired video-audio data. To generate spatial audio from 360-degree video, we propose a novel framework OmniAudio, which leverages self-supervised pre-training using both spatial audio data (in FOA format) and large-scale non-spatial data. Furthermore, OmniAudio features a dual-branch framework that utilizes both panoramic and perspective video inputs to capture comprehensive local and global information from 360-degree videos. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance across both objective and subjective metrics on Sphere360.

Recent studies leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract cell states by translating gene or protein expression into biological context. However, existing single-cell LLMs face two major challenges: (1) Integration of spatial information: they struggle to generalize spatial coordinates and effectively encode spatial context as text, and (2) Treating each cell independently: they overlook cell-cell interactions, limiting their ability to capture biological relationships. To address these limitations, we propose Spatial2Sentence, a novel framework that integrates single-cell expression and spatial information into natural language using a multi-sentence approach. Spatial2Sentence constructs expression similarity and distance matrices, pairing spatially adjacent and expressionally similar cells as positive pairs while using distant and dissimilar cells as negatives. These multi-sentence representations enable LLMs to learn cellular interactions in both expression and spatial contexts. Equipped with multi-task learning, Spatial2Sentence outperforms existing single-cell LLMs on preprocessed IMC datasets, improving cell-type classification by 5.98% and clinical status prediction by 4.18% on the diabetes dataset while enhancing interpretability.

Current large multimodal models (LMMs), however, lack of this capability of 3D spatial reasoning. This limitation stems from the scarcity of 3D training data and the bias in current model designs toward 2D data. In this paper, we systematically study the impact of 3D-informed data, architecture, and training setups, introducing SpatialLLM, a large multi-modal model with advanced 3D spatial reasoning abilities. To address data limitations, we develop two types of 3D-informed training datasets: (1) 3D-informed probing data focused on object's 3D location and orientation, and (2) 3D-informed conversation data for complex spatial relationships. Notably, we are the first to curate VQA data that incorporate 3D orientation relationships on real images. Furthermore, we systematically integrate these two types of training data with the architectural and training designs of LMMs, providing a roadmap for optimal design aimed at achieving superior 3D reasoning capabilities. Our SpatialLLM advances machines toward highly capable 3D-informed reasoning, surpassing GPT-4o performance by 8.7%. Our systematic empirical design and the resulting findings offer valuable insights for future research in this direction.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 highlight |

To assess how well current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have acquired this fundamental capability, we introduce LEGO-Puzzles, a scalable benchmark designed to evaluate both spatial understanding and sequential reasoning in MLLMs through LEGO-based tasks. LEGO-Puzzles consists of 1,100 carefully curated visual question-answering (VQA) samples spanning 11 distinct tasks, ranging from basic spatial understanding to complex multi-step reasoning. Based on LEGO-Puzzles, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs and uncover significant limitations in their spatial reasoning capabilities: even the most powerful MLLMs can answer only about half of the test cases, whereas human participants achieve over 90% accuracy. Furthermore, based on LEGO-Puzzles, we design generation tasks to investigate whether MLLMs can transfer their spatial understanding and reasoning abilities to image generation. Our experiments show that only GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-Flash exhibit a limited ability to follow these instructions, while other MLLMs either replicate the input image or generate completely irrelevant outputs. Overall, LEGO-Puzzles exposes critical deficiencies in existing MLLMs' spatial understanding and sequential reasoning capabilities, and underscores the need for further advancements in multimodal spatial reasoning.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

Inspired by the R1 paradigm introduced in DeepSeek-R1, which enhances reasoning in language models through rule-based reinforcement learning (RL), we propose SVQA-R1, the first framework to extend R1-style training to spatial VQA. In particular, we introduce Spatial-GRPO, a novel group-wise RL strategy that constructs view-consistent rewards by perturbing spatial relations between objects, e.g., mirror flipping, thereby encouraging the model to develop a consistent and grounded understanding of space. Our model, SVQA-R1, not only achieves dramatically improved accuracy on spatial VQA benchmarks but also exhibits interpretable reasoning paths even without using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data.

Existing FCIL methods typically integrate old knowledge preservation into local client training. However, these methods cannot avoid spatial-temporal client drift caused by data heterogeneity and often incur significant computational and communication overhead, limiting practical deployment. To address these challenges simultaneously, we propose a novel approach, Spatial-Temporal Statistics Aggregation (STSA), which provides a unified framework to aggregate feature statistics both spatially (across clients) and temporally (across stages). The aggregated feature statistics are unaffected by data heterogeneity and can be used to update the classifier in closed form at each stage. Additionally, we introduce STSA-E, a communication-efficient variant with theoretical guarantees, achieving similar performance to STSA-E with much lower communication overhead. Extensive experiments on three widely used FCIL datasets, with varying degrees of data heterogeneity, show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art FCIL methods in terms of performance, flexibility, and both communication and computation efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Bayesian spatial factor models, in particular, face pronounced identifiability concerns and scaling difficulties. To mitigate these issues and enhance posterior inference reliability, this work proposes Projected Markov Chain Monte Carlo (ProjMC$^2$), a novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm employing projection techniques and conditional conjugacy. ProjMC$^2$ is showcased within the context of spatial factor analysis, significantly improving posterior stability and MCMC mixing efficiency by projecting posterior sampling of latent factors onto a subspace of a scaled Stiefel manifold. Theoretical results establish convergence to the stationary distribution irrespective of initial values. Integrating this approach with scalable univariate spatial modeling strategies yields a stable, efficient, and flexible modeling and sampling methodology for large-scale spatial factor models. Simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness and practical advantages of the proposed methods. The practical utility of the methodology is further illustrated through an analysis of spatial transcriptomic data obtained from human kidney tissues, showcasing its potential for enhancing the interpretability and robustness of spatial transcriptomics analyses.</p></details> | 32 pages, 5 figures |

This challenge stems from two key issues: first, incorporating spatial-temporal localization introduces a vast number of coordinate combinations, complicating the alignment of linguistic and visual coordinate representations; second, encoding fine-grained temporal and spatial information during video feature compression is inherently difficult. To address these issues, we propose LLaVA-ST, a MLLM for fine-grained spatial-temporal multimodal understanding. In LLaVA-ST, we propose Language-Aligned Positional Embedding, which embeds the textual coordinate special token into the visual space, simplifying the alignment of fine-grained spatial-temporal correspondences. Additionally, we design the Spatial-Temporal Packer, which decouples the feature compression of temporal and spatial resolutions into two distinct point-to-region attention processing streams. Furthermore, we propose ST-Align dataset with 4.3M training samples for fine-grained spatial-temporal multimodal understanding. With ST-align, we present a progressive training pipeline that aligns the visual and textual feature through sequential coarse-to-fine stages.Additionally, we introduce an ST-Align benchmark to evaluate spatial-temporal interleaved fine-grained understanding tasks, which include Spatial-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) , Event Localization and Captioning (ELC) and Spatial Video Grounding (SVG). LLaVA-ST achieves outstanding performance on 11 benchmarks requiring fine-grained temporal, spatial, or spatial-temporal interleaving multimodal understanding.

While existing audio spatialization methods can generally map any available monaural audio to binaural audio signals, they often lack the flexible and interactive control needed in complex multi-object user-interactive environments. To address this, we propose a Text-guided Audio Spatialization (TAS) framework that utilizes flexible text prompts and evaluates our model from unified generation and comprehension perspectives. Due to the limited availability of premium and large-scale stereo data, we construct the SpatialTAS dataset, which encompasses 376,000 simulated binaural audio samples to facilitate the training of our model. Our model learns binaural differences guided by 3D spatial location and relative position prompts, augmented by flipped-channel audio. It outperforms existing methods on both simulated and real-recorded datasets, demonstrating superior generalization and accuracy. Besides, we develop an assessment model based on Llama-3.1-8B, which evaluates the spatial semantic coherence between our generated binaural audio and text prompts through a spatial reasoning task. Results demonstrate that text prompts provide flexible and interactive control to generate binaural audio with excellent quality and semantic consistency in spatial locations.

However, existing 2D editing-based methods often rely on spatial priors such as 2D masks or 3D bounding boxes, and they struggle to ensure consistency of the inserted object. These limitations hinder flexibility and scalability in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose FreeInsert, a novel framework that leverages foundation models including MLLMs, LGMs, and diffusion models to disentangle object generation from spatial placement. This enables unsupervised and flexible object insertion in 3D scenes without spatial priors. FreeInsert starts with an MLLM-based parser that extracts structured semantics, including object types, spatial relationships, and attachment regions, from user instructions. These semantics guide both the reconstruction of the inserted object for 3D consistency and the learning of its degrees of freedom. We leverage the spatial reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to initialize object pose and scale. A hierarchical, spatially aware refinement stage further integrates spatial semantics and MLLM-inferred priors to enhance placement. Finally, the appearance of the object is improved using the inserted-object image to enhance visual fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that FreeInsert achieves semantically coherent, spatially precise, and visually realistic 3D insertions without relying on spatial priors, offering a user-friendly and flexible editing experience.</p></details> |  |

Spatial contiguity, a fundamental constraint requiring spatial entities to form connected components, significantly increases the complexity of regionalization problems, which are typically challenging for quantum modeling. This paper proposes novel quantum formulations based on a flow model that enforces spatial contiguity constraints. Our scale-aware approach employs a Discrete Quadratic Model (DQM), solvable directly on quantum annealing hardware for small-scale datasets. In addition, it designs a hybrid quantum-classical approach to manage larger-scale problems within existing hardware limitations.

Unlike in Gaussian likelihoods, inference is considerably encumbered by the inability to analytically integrate out the random effects and reduce the dimension of the parameter space. Iterative estimation algorithms struggle to converge due to the presence of weakly identified parameters. We devise Bayesian inference using predictive stacking that assimilates inference from analytically tractable conditional posterior distributions. We achieve this by expanding upon the Diaconis-Ylvisaker family of conjugate priors and exploiting generalised conjugate multivariate (GCM) distribution theory for exponential families, which enables exact sampling from analytically available posterior distributions conditional upon some process parameters. Subsequently, we assimilate inference over a range of values of these parameters using Bayesian predictive stacking. We evaluate inferential performance on simulated data, compare with full Bayesian inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and apply our method to analyse spatially-temporally referenced avian count data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey database.</p></details> | 37 pages, 8 figures |

However, they often fall short when tackling real-life geospatial tasks within urban environments. This limitation stems from a lack of physical world knowledge and relevant data during training. To address this gap, we propose \textit{CityGPT}, a systematic framework designed to enhance LLMs' understanding of urban space and improve their ability to solve the related urban tasks by integrating a city-scale `world model' into the model. Firstly, we construct a diverse instruction tuning dataset, \textit{CityInstruction}, for injecting urban knowledge into LLMs and effectively boosting their spatial reasoning capabilities. Using a combination of \textit{CityInstruction} and open source general instruction data, we introduce a novel and easy-to-use self-weighted fine-tuning method (\textit{SWFT}) to train various LLMs (including ChatGLM3-6B, Llama3-8B, and Qwen2.5-7B) to enhance their urban spatial capabilities without compromising, or even improving, their general abilities. Finally, to validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we develop a comprehensive text-based spatial benchmark \textit{CityEval} for evaluating the performance of LLMs across a wide range of urban scenarios and geospatial tasks.

We present GenSpace, a novel benchmark and evaluation pipeline to comprehensively assess the spatial awareness of current image generation models. Furthermore, standard evaluations using general Vision-Language Models (VLMs) frequently fail to capture the detailed spatial errors. To handle this challenge, we propose a specialized evaluation pipeline and metric, which reconstructs 3D scene geometry using multiple visual foundation models and provides a more accurate and human-aligned metric of spatial faithfulness. Our findings show that while AI models create visually appealing images and can follow general instructions, they struggle with specific 3D details like object placement, relationships, and measurements. We summarize three core limitations in the spatial perception of current state-of-the-art image generation models: 1) Object Perspective Understanding, 2) Egocentric-Allocentric Transformation and 3) Metric Measurement Adherence, highlighting possible directions for improving spatial intelligence in image generation.</p></details> |  |

Recent technological advances have led to the collection of various indicators of air pollution at increasingly high spatial-temporal resolutions (e.g., daily averages of pollutant levels at spatial locations referenced by latitude-longitude). However, health outcomes are typically aggregated over several spatial-temporal coordinates (e.g., annual prevalence for a county) to comply with survey regulations. This article develops a Bayesian hierarchical model to analyze such spatially-temporally misaligned exposure and health outcome data. We introduce Bayesian predictive stacking, which optimally combines multiple predictive spatial-temporal models and avoids iterative estimation algorithms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo that struggle due to convergence issues inflicted by the presence of weakly identified parameters.

We introduce Disjoint-3DQA , a generative QA benchmark that evaluates this ability of VLMs by posing questions about object pairs that are not co-visible in the same frame. We evaluated seven state-of-the-art VLMs and found that models lag behind human performance by 28%, with steeper declines in accuracy (60% to 30 %) as the temporal gap widens. Our analysis further reveals that providing trajectories or bird's-eye-view projections to VLMs results in only marginal improvements, whereas providing oracle 3D coordinates leads to a substantial 20% performance increase. This highlights a core bottleneck of multi-frame VLMs in constructing and maintaining 3D scene representations over time from visual signals. Disjoint-3DQA therefore sets a clear, measurable challenge for long-horizon spatial reasoning and aims to catalyze future research at the intersection of vision, language, and embodied AI.</p></details> |  |

Although inference for r-Pareto processes is easier than for max-stable processes, there remain major hurdles for their application to high dimensional datasets within a reasonable timeframe. In addition, both approaches have almost exclusively focused on the Brown-Resnick model, for its Gaussian foundations, and for the continuity of its exponent measure. In this paper, we derive a class of models for which this continuity property holds and present the skewed Brown-Resnick model, an extension of the Brown-Resnick that allows for non-stationarity in the dependence structure, and the truncated extremal-t model, a refinement of the well-known extremal-$t$ model. We use an inference methodology based on the intensity function of the process which is derived from the exponent measure, and demonstrate the statistical and computational efficiency of this approach. Applications to two real-world problems illustrate valuable gains in modelling flexibility as well as appealing computational gains over reference methodologies.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods primarily focus on band regrouping and rely on RGB trackers for feature extraction, resulting in limited exploration of spectral information and difficulties in achieving complementary representations of object features. In this paper, a spatial-spectral fusion network with spectral angle awareness (SST-Net) is proposed for hyperspectral (HS) object tracking. Firstly, to address the issue of insufficient spectral feature extraction in existing networks, a spatial-spectral feature backbone ($S^2$FB) is designed. With the spatial and spectral extraction branch, a joint representation of texture and spectrum is obtained. Secondly, a spectral attention fusion module (SAFM) is presented to capture the intra- and inter-modality correlation to obtain the fused features from the HS and RGB modalities. It can incorporate the visual information into the HS spectral context to form a robust representation. Thirdly, to ensure a more accurate response of the tracker to the object position, a spectral angle awareness module (SAAM) investigates the region-level spectral similarity between the template and search images during the prediction stage. Furthermore, we develop a novel spectral angle awareness loss (SAAL) to offer guidance for the SAAM based on similar regions. Finally, to obtain the robust tracking results, a weighted prediction method is considered to combine the HS and RGB predicted motions of objects to leverage the strengths of each modality. Extensive experiments on the HOTC dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SSF-Net, compared with state-of-the-art trackers.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Image Processing 2025</p></details> |

While quantization offers a pathway to efficiency, existing methods struggle to balance performance and overhead, either incurring high computational/memory costs or failing to address activation outliers, a critical bottleneck in quantized fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose the Outlier Spatial Stability Hypothesis (OSSH): During fine-tuning, certain activation outlier channels retain stable spatial positions across training iterations. Building on OSSH, we propose Quaff, a Quantized parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework for LLMs, optimizing low-precision activation representations through targeted momentum scaling. Quaff dynamically suppresses outliers exclusively in invariant channels using lightweight operations, eliminating full-precision weight storage and global rescaling while reducing quantization errors. Extensive experiments across ten benchmarks validate OSSH and demonstrate Quaff's efficacy. Specifically, on the GPQA reasoning benchmark, Quaff achieves a 1.73x latency reduction and 30% memory savings over full-precision fine-tuning while improving accuracy by 0.6% on the Phi-3 model, reconciling the triple trade-off between efficiency, performance, and deployability. By enabling consumer-grade GPU fine-tuning (e.g., RTX 2080 Super) without sacrificing model utility, Quaff democratizes personalized LLM deployment.

By embedding the dual-tail novel Archimedean copula viz. A2 directly into the network's weight initialization, A2-SBNN naturally models complex spatial relationships, including rare co-movements in the data. The model is trained through a calibration-driven process combining Wasserstein loss, moment matching, and correlation penalties to refine predictions and manage uncertainty. Simulation results show that A2-SBNN consistently delivers high accuracy across a wide range of dependency strengths, offering a new, effective solution for spatial data modeling beyond traditional Gaussian-based approaches.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks, however, probe only single-image relations and thus fail to assess the multi-image spatial reasoning that real-world deployments demand. We introduce MMSI-Bench, a VQA benchmark dedicated to multi-image spatial intelligence. Six 3D-vision researchers spent more than 300 hours meticulously crafting 1,000 challenging, unambiguous multiple-choice questions from over 120,000 images, each paired with carefully designed distractors and a step-by-step reasoning process. We conduct extensive experiments and thoroughly evaluate 34 open-source and proprietary MLLMs, observing a wide gap: the strongest open-source model attains roughly 30% accuracy and OpenAI's o3 reasoning model reaches 40%, while humans score 97%. These results underscore the challenging nature of MMSI-Bench and the substantial headroom for future research. Leveraging the annotated reasoning processes, we also provide an automated error analysis pipeline that diagnoses four dominant failure modes, including (1) grounding errors, (2) overlap-matching and scene-reconstruction errors, (3) situation-transformation reasoning errors, and (4) spatial-logic errors, offering valuable insights for advancing multi-image spatial intelligence.

However, improving their spatial intelligence remains a challenge. Existing 3D MLLMs always rely on additional 3D or 2.5D data to incorporate spatial awareness, restricting their utility in scenarios with only 2D inputs, such as images or videos. In this paper, we present Spatial-MLLM, a novel framework for visual-based spatial reasoning from purely 2D observations. Unlike conventional video MLLMs which rely on CLIP-based visual encoders optimized for semantic understanding, our key insight is to unleash the strong structure prior from the feed-forward visual geometry foundation model. Specifically, we propose a dual-encoder architecture: a pretrained 2D visual encoder to extract semantic features, and a spatial encoder-initialized from the backbone of the visual geometry model-to extract 3D structure features. A connector then integrates both features into unified visual tokens for enhanced spatial understanding. Furthermore, we propose a space-aware frame sampling strategy at inference time, which selects the spatially informative frames of a video sequence, ensuring that even under limited token length, the model focuses on frames critical for spatial reasoning. Beyond architecture improvements, we construct the Spatial-MLLM-120k dataset and train the model on it using supervised fine-tuning and GRPO. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our spatial-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of visual-based spatial understanding and reasoning tasks.

This reasoning ability is also crucial for machines to interact with their environment in a human-like manner. However, recent research shows that even state-of-the-art language models struggle with spatial reasoning over text, especially when facing nesting spatial expressions. This is attributed to not achieving the right level of abstraction required for generalizability. To alleviate this issue, we propose training language models with neuro-symbolic techniques that exploit the spatial logical rules as constraints, providing additional supervision to improve spatial reasoning and question answering. Training language models to adhere to spatial reasoning rules guides them in making more effective and general abstractions for transferring spatial knowledge to various domains. We evaluate our approach on existing spatial question-answering benchmarks. Our results indicate the effectiveness of our proposed technique in improving language models in complex multi-hop spatial reasoning over text.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, NAACL 2025 findings</p></details> |

Recent strong augmentation methods have primarily focused on intensity-based perturbations, which have minimal impact on the semantic masks. In contrast, spatial augmentations like translation and rotation have long been acknowledged for their effectiveness in supervised semantic segmentation tasks, but they are often ignored in SSSS. In this work, we demonstrate that spatial augmentation can also contribute to model training in SSSS, despite generating inconsistent masks between the weak and strong augmentations. Furthermore, recognizing the variability among images, we propose an adaptive augmentation strategy that dynamically adjusts the augmentation for each instance based on entropy. Extensive experiments show that our proposed Adaptive Spatial Augmentation (\textbf{ASAug}) can be integrated as a pluggable module, consistently improving the performance of existing methods and achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets such as PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes, and COCO.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

Whittle-type likelihoods in the frequency domain based on the fast Fourier Transform (FFT) have several appealing features: i) low computational complexity of only $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of spatial locations, ii) robustness to assumptions of the data-generating process, iii) ability to handle missing data and irregularly spaced domains, and iv) flexibility in modelling the covariance function via the spectral density directly in the spectral domain. It is well known, however, that the Whittle likelihood suffers from bias and low efficiency for spatial data. The debiased Whittle likelihood is a recently proposed alternative with better frequentist properties. We propose a methodology for Bayesian inference for stationary random fields using the debiased spatial Whittle likelihood, with an adjustment from the composite likelihood literature. The adjustment is shown to give a well-calibrated Bayesian posterior as measured by coverage properties of credible sets, without sacrificing the quasi-linear computation time. We apply the method to simulated data and two real datasets.</p></details> |  |

It allows real-time recognition and detection of vehicles, pedestrians and obstacles under varying environmental conditions. Among existing methods, 3D object detection in the Bird's Eye View (BEV) has emerged as the mainstream framework. To guarantee a safe, robust and trustworthy 3D object detection, 3D adversarial attacks are investigated, where attacks are placed in 3D environments to evaluate the model performance, e.g. putting a film on a car, clothing a pedestrian. The vulnerability of 3D object detection models to 3D adversarial attacks serves as an important indicator to evaluate the robustness of the model against perturbations. To investigate this vulnerability, we generate non-invasive 3D adversarial objects tailored for real-world attack scenarios. Our method verifies the existence of universal adversarial objects that are spatially consistent across time and camera views. Specifically, we employ differentiable rendering techniques to accurately model the spatial relationship between adversarial objects and the target vehicle. Furthermore, we introduce an occlusion-aware module to enhance visual consistency and realism under different viewpoints. To maintain attack effectiveness across multiple frames, we design a BEV spatial feature-guided optimization strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can reliably suppress vehicle predictions from state-of-the-art 3D object detectors, serving as an important tool to test robustness of 3D object detection models before deployment. Moreover, the generated adversarial objects exhibit strong generalization capabilities, retaining its effectiveness at various positions and distances in the scene.</p></details> |  |

Such a model enables high-quality visual generation, and also ensures the reliability of world models for downstream tasks such as simulation and planning. Designing a memory module is a crucial component for addressing spatial consistency: such a model must not only retain long-horizon observational information, but also enables the construction of explicit or implicit internal spatial representations. However, there are no dataset designed to promote the development of memory modules by explicitly enforcing spatial consistency constraints. Furthermore, most existing benchmarks primarily emphasize visual coherence or generation quality, neglecting the requirement of long-range spatial consistency. To bridge this gap, we construct a dataset and corresponding benchmark by sampling 150 distinct locations within the open-world environment of Minecraft, collecting about 250 hours (20 million frames) of loop-based navigation videos with actions. Our dataset follows a curriculum design of sequence lengths, allowing models to learn spatial consistency on increasingly complex navigation trajectories. Furthermore, our data collection pipeline is easily extensible to new Minecraft environments and modules. Four representative world model baselines are evaluated on our benchmark. Dataset, benchmark, and code are open-sourced to support future research.</p></details> |  |

Advances in nanophotonic fabrication and metasurface-based wavefront engineering have opened new pathways to realize high-capacity DONNs across various spectral regimes. Training such DONN systems to determine the metasurface structures remains challenging. Heuristic methods are fast but oversimplify metasurfaces modulation, often resulting in physically unrealizable designs and significant performance degradation. Simulation-in-the-loop optimizes implementable metasurfaces via adjoint methods, but is computationally prohibitive and unscalable. To address these limitations, we propose SP2RINT, a spatially decoupled, progressive training framework that formulates DONN training as a PDE-constrained learning problem. Metasurface responses are first relaxed into freely trainable transfer matrices with a banded structure. We then progressively enforce physical constraints by alternating between transfer matrix training and adjoint-based inverse design, avoiding per-iteration PDE solves while ensuring final physical realizability. To further reduce runtime, we introduce a physics-inspired, spatially decoupled inverse design strategy based on the natural locality of field interactions. This approach partitions the metasurface into independently solvable patches, enabling scalable and parallel inverse design with system-level calibration. Evaluated across diverse DONN training tasks, SP2RINT achieves digital-comparable accuracy while being 1825 times faster than simulation-in-the-loop approaches. By bridging the gap between abstract DONN models and implementable photonic hardware, SP2RINT enables scalable, high-performance training of physically realizable meta-optical neural systems.

In contrast, current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to effectively plan and act in dynamic, multi-room 3D environments. We posit that part of this limitation is due to the lack of proper 3D spatial-temporal memory modeling in LLMs. To address this, we first introduce 3DMem-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising over 26,000 trajectories and 2,892 embodied tasks, question-answering and captioning, designed to evaluate an agent's ability to reason over long-term memory in 3D environments. Second, we propose 3DLLM-Mem, a novel dynamic memory management and fusion model for embodied spatial-temporal reasoning and actions in LLMs. Our model uses working memory tokens, which represents current observations, as queries to selectively attend to and fuse the most useful spatial and temporal features from episodic memory, which stores past observations and interactions. Our approach allows the agent to focus on task-relevant information while maintaining memory efficiency in complex, long-horizon environments. Experimental results demonstrate that 3DLLM-Mem achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks, outperforming the strongest baselines by 16.5% in success rate on 3DMem-Bench's most challenging in-the-wild embodied tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>demos...</summary><p>demos at: https://3dllm-mem.github.io</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce SKG2Data, a novel multimodal synthesis approach guided by spatial knowledge graphs, grounded in the concept of knowledge-to-data generation. SKG2Data automatically constructs a Spatial Knowledge Graph (SKG) to emulate human-like perception of spatial directions and distances, which is subsequently utilized to guide multimodal data synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that data synthesized from diverse types of spatial knowledge, including direction and distance, not only enhance the spatial perception and reasoning abilities of MLLMs but also exhibit strong generalization capabilities. We hope that the idea of knowledge-based data synthesis can advance the development of spatial intelligence.</p></details> | Ongoing work |

We propose a novel machine learning (ML) framework that integrates spatial extreme-value theory to model weather extremes and to quantify probabilities associated with the occurrence, intensity, and spatial extent of these events. Our approach employs new loss functions adapted to extreme values, enabling our model to prioritize the tail rather than the bulk of the data distribution. Applied to a case study of Western European summertime heat extremes, we use daily 500-hPa geopotential height fields and local soil moisture as predictors to capture the complex interplay between local and remote physical processes. Our generative model reveals that different facets of heat extremes are influenced by individual circulation features, such as the relative position of upper-level ridges and troughs that are part of a large-scale wave pattern. This enriches our process understanding from a data-driven perspective. Our approach can extrapolate beyond the range of the data to make risk-related probabilistic statements. It applies more generally to other weather extremes and offers an alternative to traditional physical and ML-based techniques that focus less on the extremal aspects of weather data.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches that rely on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods can capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of odor plumes, but are impractical for large-scale simulations due to their computational expense. On the other hand, puff-based simulations, although computationally tractable for large scales and capable of capturing the stochastic nature of plumes, fail to reproduce naturalistic odor statistics. Here, we present COSMOS (Configurable Odor Simulation Model over Scalable Spaces), a data-driven probabilistic framework that synthesizes realistic odor time series from spatial and temporal features of real datasets. COSMOS generates similar distributions of key statistical features such as whiff frequency, duration, and concentration as observed in real data, while dramatically reducing computational overhead. By reproducing critical statistical properties across a variety of flow regimes and scales, COSMOS enables the development and evaluation of agent-based navigation strategies with naturalistic odor experiences. To demonstrate its utility, we compare odor-tracking agents exposed to CFD-generated plumes versus COSMOS simulations, showing that both their odor experiences and resulting behaviors are quite similar.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4 primary figures</p></details> |

To this end, we develop a spatial Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) for the post-processing of surface maximum wind gusts from the COSMO-REA6 reanalysis. Our approach uses a non-stationary extreme value distribution for the gust observations, with parameters that vary according to a linear model using COSMO-REA6 predictor variables. To capture spatial patterns in surface wind gust behavior, the regression coefficients are modeled as 2-dimensional Gaussian random fields with a constant mean and an isotropic covariance function that depends on the distance between locations. In addition, we include an elevation offset in the distance metric for the covariance function to account for the topography. This allows us to include data from mountaintop stations in the training process. The training of the BHM is carried out with an independent data set from which the data at the station to be predicted are excluded. We evaluate the spatial prediction performance at the withheld station using Brier score and quantile score, including their decomposition, and compare the performance of our BHM to climatological forecasts and a non-hierarchical, spatially constant baseline model. This is done for 109 weather stations in Germany. Compared to the spatially constant baseline model, the spatial BHM significantly improves the estimation of local gust parameters. It shows up to 5 % higher skill for prediction quantiles and provides a particularly improved skill for extreme wind gusts. In addition, the BHM improves the prediction of threshold levels at most of the stations. Although a spatially constant approach already provides high skill, our BHM further improves predictions and improves spatial consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 Pa...</summary><p>41 Pages, 17 figures.

While current SNN hardware accelerators often prioritize temporal spike sparsity, exploiting sparse synaptic weights offers significant untapped potential for even greater efficiency. To address this, we propose FireFly-S, a Sparse extension of the FireFly series. This co-optimized software-hardware design focusing on leveraging dual-side sparsity for acceleration. On the software side, we propose a novel algorithmic optimization framework that combines gradient rewiring for pruning and modified Learned Step Size Quantization (LSQ) tailored for SNNs, which achieves remarkable weight sparsity exceeding 85\% and enables efficient 4-bit quantization with negligible accuracy loss. On the hardware side, we present an efficient dual-side sparsity detector employing a Bitmap-based sparse decoding logic to pinpoint the positions of non-zero weights and input spikes. The logic allows for the direct bypassing of redundant computations, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. Different from the overlay architecture adopted by previous FireFly series, we adopt a spatial architecture with inter-layer pipelining that can fully exploit the nature of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). A spatial-temporal dataflow is also proposed to support such inter-layer pipelining and avoid long-term temporal dependencies. In experiments conducted on the MNIST, DVS-Gesture and CIFAR-10 datasets, the FireFly-S model achieves 85-95\% sparsity with 4-bit quantization and the hardware accelerator effectively leverages the dual-side sparsity, delivering outstanding performance metrics of 10,047 FPS/W on MNIST, 3,683 FPS/W on DVS-Gesture, and 2,327 FPS/W on CIFAR-10.</p></details> |  |

An adaptive block-based change-point detection framework is proposed that accounts for spatial dependencies across dimensions and leverages these dependencies to boost detection power and improve estimation accuracy. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that our approach has superior performance in detecting sparse changes in datasets with spatial or local group structures.

We identify a critical limitation: current VLMs excel primarily at egocentric spatial reasoning (from the camera's perspective) but fail to generalize to allocentric viewpoints when required to adopt another entity's spatial frame of reference. We introduce ViewSpatial-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for multi-viewpoint spatial localization recognition evaluation across five distinct task types, supported by an automated 3D annotation pipeline that generates precise directional labels. Comprehensive evaluation of diverse VLMs on ViewSpatial-Bench reveals a significant performance disparity: models demonstrate reasonable performance on camera-perspective tasks but exhibit reduced accuracy when reasoning from a human viewpoint. By fine-tuning VLMs on our multi-perspective spatial dataset, we achieve an overall performance improvement of 46.24% across tasks, highlighting the efficacy of our approach.

However, existing PointMamba-based methods depend on complex token ordering and random masking, which disrupt spatial continuity and local semantic correlations. We propose ZigzagPointMamba to tackle these challenges. The core of our approach is a simple zigzag scan path that globally sequences point cloud tokens, enhancing spatial continuity by preserving the proximity of spatially adjacent point tokens. Nevertheless, random masking undermines local semantic modeling in self-supervised learning. To address this, we introduce a Semantic-Siamese Masking Strategy (SMS), which masks semantically similar tokens to facilitate reconstruction by integrating local features of original and similar tokens. This overcomes the dependence on isolated local features and enables robust global semantic modeling. Our pre-trained ZigzagPointMamba weights significantly improve downstream tasks, achieving a 1.59% mIoU gain on ShapeNetPart for part segmentation, a 0.4% higher accuracy on ModelNet40 for classification, and 0.19%, 1.22%, and 0.72% higher accuracies respectively for the classification tasks on the OBJ-BG, OBJ-ONLY, and PB-T50-RS subsets of ScanObjectNN.

We introduce SURDS, a large-scale benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the spatial reasoning capabilities of vision language models (VLMs). Built on the nuScenes dataset, SURDS comprises 41,080 vision-question-answer training instances and 9,250 evaluation samples, spanning six spatial categories: orientation, depth estimation, pixel-level localization, pairwise distance, lateral ordering, and front-behind relations. We benchmark leading general-purpose VLMs, including GPT, Gemini, and Qwen, revealing persistent limitations in fine-grained spatial understanding. To address these deficiencies, we go beyond static evaluation and explore whether alignment techniques can improve spatial reasoning performance. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning-based alignment scheme leveraging spatially grounded reward signals - capturing both perception-level accuracy (location) and reasoning consistency (logic). We further incorporate final-answer correctness and output-format rewards to guide fine-grained policy adaptation. Our GRPO-aligned variant achieves an overall score of 40.80 in the SURDS benchmark. Notably, it outperforms proprietary systems such as GPT-4o (13.30) and Gemini-2.0-flash (35.71). To our best knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that reinforcement learning-based alignment can significantly and consistently enhance the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in real-world driving contexts. We release the SURDS benchmark, evaluation toolkit, and GRPO alignment code through: https://github.com/XiandaGuo/Drive-MLLM.</p></details> |  |

However, existing multimodal mathematics benchmarks mainly focus on plane geometry and largely ignore solid geometry, which requires spatial reasoning and is more challenging than plane geometry. To address this critical gap, we introduce SolidGeo, the first large-scale benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the performance of MLLMs on mathematical reasoning tasks in solid geometry. SolidGeo consists of 3,113 real-world K-12 and competition-level problems, each paired with visual context and annotated with difficulty levels and fine-grained solid geometry categories. Our benchmark covers a wide range of 3D reasoning subjects such as projection, unfolding, spatial measurement, and spatial vector, offering a rigorous testbed for assessing solid geometry. Through extensive experiments, we observe that MLLMs encounter substantial challenges in solid geometry math tasks, with a considerable performance gap relative to human capabilities on SolidGeo. Moreover, we analyze the performance, inference efficiency and error patterns of various models, offering insights into the solid geometric mathematical reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. We hope SolidGeo serves as a catalyst for advancing MLLMs toward deeper geometric reasoning and spatial intelligence.</p></details> |  |

AI agents with the spatial planning ability can better adapt to various real-world applications, including robotic manipulation, automatic assembly, urban planning etc. Recent works have attempted to construct benchmarks for evaluating the spatial intelligence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Nevertheless, these benchmarks primarily focus on spatial reasoning based on typical Visual Question-Answering (VQA) forms, which suffers from the gap between abstract spatial understanding and concrete task execution. In this work, we take a step further to build a comprehensive benchmark called MineAnyBuild, aiming to evaluate the spatial planning ability of open-world AI agents in the Minecraft game. Specifically, MineAnyBuild requires an agent to generate executable architecture building plans based on the given multi-modal human instructions. It involves 4,000 curated spatial planning tasks and also provides a paradigm for infinitely expandable data collection by utilizing rich player-generated content. MineAnyBuild evaluates spatial planning through four core supporting dimensions: spatial understanding, spatial reasoning, creativity, and spatial commonsense. Based on MineAnyBuild, we perform a comprehensive evaluation for existing MLLM-based agents, revealing the severe limitations but enormous potential in their spatial planning abilities. We believe our MineAnyBuild will open new avenues for the evaluation of spatial intelligence and help promote further development for open-world AI agents capable of spatial planning.</p></details> |  |

The dataset includes a variety of tasks, ranging from filling in masked regions within partial structures to predicting complete material distributions. Solving these tasks requires understanding the flow of forces and the required material distribution under given constraints, without access to simulation tools or explicit physical models, challenging models to reason about structural stability and spatial organization. Our dataset targets the evaluation of spatial and physical reasoning abilities in 2D settings, offering a complementary perspective to traditional language and logic benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach across various pretrained image classifiers from CNNs to ViTs, showing excellent reconstruction capabilities.

While prior imitation-learning approaches have made progress, their reliance on raw RGB inputs and handcrafted features often leads to overfitting and poor 3D reasoning under varied lighting, occlusion, and object conditions. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that couples robust multimodal perception with reliable grasp prediction. Our architecture fuses domain-randomized augmentation, monocular depth estimation, and a depth-aware 6-DoF Grasp Prompt into a single spatial representation for downstream action planning. Conditioned on this encoding and a high-level task prompt, our diffusion-based policy yields precise action sequences, achieving up to 40% improvement in grasp success and 45% higher task success rates under environmental variation. These results demonstrate that spatially grounded perception, paired with diffusion-based imitation learning, offers a scalable and robust solution for general-purpose robotic grasping.</p></details> |  |

However, this data-sharing scheme renders the system vulnerable to various malicious behaviors, as Byzantine agents can initiate cyberattacks by injecting sophisticated false data. To better investigate the impacts of malicious Byzantine faults, this paper develops a fully distributed P2P energy trading model by accounting for the high-fidelity physical network constraints. To further detect Byzantine faults and mitigate their impacts on distributed P2P energy trading problem, we propose an online spatial-temporal anomaly detection approach by leveraging the tensor learning method, which is informed by the domain knowledge to enable awesome detection performance. Moreover, to enhance its computational efficiency, we further develop closed-form solutions for the proposed detection approach. Subsequently, we derive theoretical conditions for guaranteeing optimality and convergence of the distributed P2P energy trading problem with anomaly detection mechanisms. Results from numerical simulations validate the effectiveness, optimality, and scalability of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

However, given the inherently chaotic nature of our system, this assumption is complicated by sensitive dependence, where small uncertainties in initial conditions can lead to exponentially diverging outcomes over time. This challenge is particularly salient at global spatial scales and over centennial timescales, where data gaps are not just common but expected. The source of uncertainty is two-fold: (1) sparse, noisy observations from satellites and ground stations, and (2) internal variability stemming from the simplifying approximations within the models themselves. In practice, data assimilation methods are used to reconcile this missing information by conditioning model states on partial observations. Our work builds on this idea but operates at the extreme end of sparsity. We propose a conditional data imputation framework that reconstructs full temperature fields from as little as 1% observational coverage. The method leverages a diffusion model guided by a prekriged mask, effectively inferring the full-state fields from minimal data points. We validate our framework over the Southern Great Plains, focusing on afternoon (12:00-6:00 PM) temperature fields during the summer months of 2018-2020. Across varying observational densities--from swath data to isolated in-situ sensors--our model achieves strong reconstruction accuracy, highlighting its potential to fill in critical data gaps in both historical reanalysis and real-time forecasting pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 14 figures, submitted to AMS Artificial Intelligence for the Earth Systems</p></details> |

We introduce Direct3D-S2, a scalable 3D generation framework based on sparse volumes that achieves superior output quality with dramatically reduced training costs. Our key innovation is the Spatial Sparse Attention (SSA) mechanism, which greatly enhances the efficiency of Diffusion Transformer (DiT) computations on sparse volumetric data. SSA allows the model to effectively process large token sets within sparse volumes, substantially reducing computational overhead and achieving a 3.9x speedup in the forward pass and a 9.6x speedup in the backward pass. Our framework also includes a variational autoencoder (VAE) that maintains a consistent sparse volumetric format across input, latent, and output stages. Compared to previous methods with heterogeneous representations in 3D VAE, this unified design significantly improves training efficiency and stability. Our model is trained on public available datasets, and experiments demonstrate that Direct3D-S2 not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods in generation quality and efficiency, but also enables training at 1024 resolution using only 8 GPUs, a task typically requiring at least 32 GPUs for volumetric representations at 256 resolution, thus making gigascale 3D generation both practical and accessible.

We investigate this gap through Transformation-Driven Visual Reasoning (TVR), a challenging task requiring identification of object transformations across images under varying viewpoints. While traditional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) fails to generate coherent reasoning paths in cross-view settings, sparse-reward Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from inefficient exploration and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we propose STAR-R1, a novel framework that integrates a single-stage RL paradigm with a fine-grained reward mechanism tailored for TVR. Specifically, STAR-R1 rewards partial correctness while penalizing excessive enumeration and passive inaction, enabling efficient exploration and precise reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that STAR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all 11 metrics, outperforming SFT by 23% in cross-view scenarios. Further analysis reveals STAR-R1's anthropomorphic behavior and highlights its unique ability to compare all objects for improving spatial reasoning. Our work provides critical insights in advancing the research of MLLMs and reasoning models.

Our proposal offers three key advances: (1) it accommodates moderate to large spatial interference effects; (2) it adapts to different spatial covariance functions; (3) it is computationally efficient. Theoretical results and numerical experiments based on synthetic environments and a dispatch simulator that models a city-scale ridesharing market, further validate the effectiveness of our design.

This limitation constrains their utility in spatially grounded tasks such as embodied AI, immersive simulations, and interactive 3D applications. We introduce a new paradigm that enables VLMs to generate, understand, and edit complex 3D environments by injecting a continually evolving spatial context. Constructed from multimodal input, this context consists of three components: a scene portrait that provides a high-level semantic blueprint, a semantically labeled point cloud capturing object-level geometry, and a scene hypergraph that encodes rich spatial relationships, including unary, binary, and higher-order constraints. Together, these components provide the VLM with a structured, geometry-aware working memory that integrates its inherent multimodal reasoning capabilities with structured 3D understanding for effective spatial reasoning. Building on this foundation, we develop an agentic 3D scene generation pipeline in which the VLM iteratively reads from and updates the spatial context. The pipeline features high-quality asset generation with geometric restoration, environment setup with automatic verification, and ergonomic adjustment guided by the scene hypergraph. Experiments show that our framework can handle diverse and challenging inputs, achieving a level of generalization not observed in prior work. Further results demonstrate that injecting spatial context enables VLMs to perform downstream tasks such as interactive scene editing and path planning, suggesting strong potential for spatially intelligent systems in computer graphics, 3D vision, and embodied applications.</p></details> |  |

Given the limitations of conventional signal processing and the scarcity of deep learning approaches to spatial aliasing mitigation, we propose a novel approach using a U-Net architecture to predict a signal-dependent de-aliasing filter, which reduces aliasing in conventional beamforming for spatial capture. Two types of multichannel filters are considered, one which treats the channels independently and a second one that models cross-channel dependencies. The proposed approach is evaluated in two common spatial capture scenarios: stereo and first-order Ambisonics. The results indicate a very significant improvement, both objective and perceptual, with respect to conventional beamforming. This work shows the potential of deep learning to reduce aliasing in beamforming, leading to improvements in multi-microphone setups.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures; accepted for presentation in Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

Achieving successful VSR requires producing realistic HR details and ensuring both spatial and temporal consistency. To restore realistic details, diffusion-based VSR approaches have recently been proposed. However, the inherent randomness of diffusion, combined with their tile-based approach, often leads to spatio-temporal inconsistencies. In this paper, we propose DC-VSR, a novel VSR approach to produce spatially and temporally consistent VSR results with realistic textures. To achieve spatial and temporal consistency, DC-VSR adopts a novel Spatial Attention Propagation (SAP) scheme and a Temporal Attention Propagation (TAP) scheme that propagate information across spatio-temporal tiles based on the self-attention mechanism. To enhance high-frequency details, we also introduce Detail-Suppression Self-Attention Guidance (DSSAG), a novel diffusion guidance scheme.

We illustrate how existing methodologies fall into this framework and propose a flexible dimension reduction algorithm that achieves the optimal trade-off. We derive a computationally simple form for our algorithm and illustrate its performance through simulation studies, as well as two applications in air pollution modeling and spatial transcriptomics.</p></details> |  |

This fragility stems from the lack of persistent memory to track evolving goals and task dependencies, undermining trust in autonomous agents. We introduce the Task Memory Engine (TME), a modular memory controller that transforms existing LLMs into robust, revision-aware agents without fine-tuning. TME implements a spatial memory framework that replaces flat context with graph-based structures to support consistent, multi-turn reasoning. Departing from linear concatenation and ReAct-style prompting, TME builds a dynamic task graph -- either a tree or directed acyclic graph (DAG) -- to map user inputs to subtasks, align them with prior context, and enable dependency-tracked revisions. Its Task Representation and Intent Management (TRIM) component models task semantics and user intent to ensure accurate interpretation. Across four multi-turn scenarios-trip planning, cooking, meeting scheduling, and shopping cart editing -- TME eliminates 100% of hallucinations and misinterpretations in three tasks, and reduces hallucinations by 66.7% and misinterpretations by 83.3% across 27 user turns, outperforming ReAct. TME's modular design supports plug-and-play deployment and domain-specific customization, adaptable to both personal assistants and enterprise automation. We release TME's codebase, benchmarks, and components as open-source resources, enabling researchers to develop reliable LLM agents.

To address this limitation, we develop a scalable Bayesian framework for spatially varying coefficient (SVC) models, implemented in the \pkg{svc} R package (available at https://github.com/jdta95/svc), which allows regression coefficients to vary smoothly over space. Our approach combines three key computational innovations: (1) a subset Gaussian process approximation that reduces the computational burden from $O(n^3)$ to $O(m^3)$ with $m<n$, while maintaining predictive accuracy; (2) a robust adaptive Metropolis (RAM) algorithm that automatically tunes proposal distributions for efficient MCMC sampling of spatial range parameters; and (3) optimized linear algebra operations leveraging precomputed distance matrices and Cholesky decompositions to accelerate covariance calculations. We present the model's theoretical foundation, prior specification, and Gibbs sampling algorithm, with a focus on practical implementation for large spatial datasets. Simulation studies demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in computational efficiency while maintaining competitive estimation accuracy. We illustrate its application in an analysis of land surface temperature (LST) data, revealing spatially varying effects of vegetation and emissivity that would be obscured by traditional regression techniques. The \pkg{svc} package provides researchers with a flexible, efficient tool for uncovering and quantifying nonstationary spatial relationships across diverse scientific domains.</p></details> |  |

However, current benchmarks have issues like relying on bounding boxes, ignoring perspective substitutions, or allowing questions to be answered using only the model's prior knowledge without image understanding. To address these issues, we introduce SpatialMQA, a human-annotated spatial relation reasoning benchmark based on COCO2017, which enables MLLMs to focus more on understanding images in the objective world. To ensure data quality, we design a well-tailored annotation procedure, resulting in SpatialMQA consisting of 5,392 samples. Based on this benchmark, a series of closed- and open-source MLLMs are implemented and the results indicate that the current state-of-the-art MLLM achieves only 48.14% accuracy, far below the human-level accuracy of 98.40%. Extensive experimental analyses are also conducted, suggesting the future research directions.

Understanding Test-Time Scaling in Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04210v1)** | 2025-06-04 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.04210v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1, DeepSeek R1) have led to a popular belief that extending thinking traces using prompts like "Wait" or "Let me rethink" can improve performance. This raises a natural question: Does thinking more at test-time truly lead to better reasoning? To answer this question, we perform a detailed empirical study across models and benchmarks, which reveals a consistent pattern of initial performance improvements from additional thinking followed by a decline, due to "overthinking". To understand this non-monotonic trend, we consider a simple probabilistic model, which reveals that additional thinking increases output variance-creating an illusion of improved reasoning while ultimately undermining precision. Thus, observed gains from "more thinking" are not true indicators of improved reasoning, but artifacts stemming from the connection between model uncertainty and evaluation metric. This suggests that test-time scaling through extended thinking is not an effective way to utilize the inference thinking budget. Recognizing these limitations, we introduce an alternative test-time scaling approach, parallel thinking, inspired by Best-of-N sampling. Our method generates multiple independent reasoning paths within the same inference budget and selects the most consistent response via majority vote, achieving up to 20% higher accuracy compared to extended thinking. This provides a simple yet effective mechanism for test-time scaling of reasoning models.</p></details> |  |

The goal is to introduce a method that avoids premature or delayed detection, which can lead to inaccurate or inefficient performance analysis. The proposed approach adapts techniques from the chemical reactors domain, detecting steady states online through the combination of kernel-based step detection and statistical methods. By using a window-based approach, it provides detailed information and improves the accuracy of identifying phase transitions, even in noisy or irregular time series. Results show that the new approach reduces total error by 14.5% compared to the state-of-the-art method. It offers more reliable detection of the steady-state onset, delivering greater precision for benchmarking tasks.

| **[Rethinking the Role of Prompting Strategies in LLM Test-Time Scaling: A Perspective of Probability Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10981v2)** | 2025-06-04 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2505.10981v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, scaling test-time compute on Large Language Models (LLM) has garnered wide attention. However, there has been limited investigation of how various reasoning prompting strategies perform as scaling. In this paper, we focus on a standard and realistic scaling setting: majority voting. We systematically conduct experiments on 6 LLMs $\times$ 8 prompting strategies $\times$ 6 benchmarks. Experiment results consistently show that as the sampling time and computational overhead increase, complicated prompting strategies with superior initial performance gradually fall behind simple Chain-of-Thought. We analyze this phenomenon and provide theoretical proofs. Additionally, we propose a probabilistic method to efficiently predict scaling performance and identify the best prompting strategy under large sampling times, eliminating the need for resource-intensive inference processes in practical applications. Furthermore, we introduce two ways derived from our theoretical analysis to significantly improve the scaling performance. We hope that our research can promote to re-examine the role of complicated prompting, unleash the potential of simple prompting strategies, and provide new insights for enhancing test-time scaling performance.

GSI combines soft best-of-$n$ test-time scaling with a reward model $r(x,y)$ and speculative samples from a small auxiliary model $\pi_S(y\mid x)$. We provably approximate the optimal tilted policy $\pi_{\beta,B}(y\mid x) \propto \pi_B(y\mid x)\exp(\beta\,r(x,y))$ of soft best-of-$n$ under the primary model $\pi_B$. We derive a theoretical bound on the KL divergence between our induced distribution and the optimal policy. In experiments on reasoning benchmarks (MATH500, OlympiadBench, Minerva Math), our method achieves higher accuracy than standard soft best-of-$n$ with $\pi_S$ and reward-guided speculative decoding (Liao et al., 2025), and in certain settings even outperforms soft best-of-$n$ with $\pi_B$.

To this end, we design spline-wavelet systems in $(0,T)$ consisting of piecewise polynomials of degree $\geq 1$ with sufficiently many vanishing moments which constitute Riesz bases in the Sobolev spaces $H^{s}_{0,}(0,T)$ and $H^{s}_{,0}(0,T)$. These bases provide stable multilevel splittings of the temporal discretization spaces into "increment" or "detail" spaces. Furthermore, they allow to optimally compress the nonlocal integrodifferential operators which appear in stable space-time variational formulations of initial-boundary value problems, such as the heat equation and the acoustic wave equation. We then obtain sparse space-time tensor-product spaces via algebraic tensor-products of the temporal multilevel discretizations with standard, hierarchic finite element spaces in the spatial domain (with standard Lagrangian FE bases). Hence, the construction of multiresolutions in the spatial domain is not necessary. An efficient multilevel preconditioner is proposed that solves the linear system of equations resulting from the sparse space-time Galerkin discretization with essentially linear complexity (in work and memory). A substantial reduction in the number of the degrees of freedom and CPU time (compared to time-marching discretizations) is demonstrated in numerical experiments.</p></details> | 33 pages |

However, the abilities of language models in this area are largely unexplored as previous work has tested their abilities for logical reasoning in terms of time and space in isolation or only in simple or artificial environments. In this paper, we present the first evaluation of the ability of language models to jointly reason over time and space. To enable our analysis, we create GeoTemp, a dataset of 320k prompts covering 289 cities in 217 countries and 37 time zones. Using GeoTemp, we evaluate eight open chat models of three different model families for different combinations of temporal and geographic knowledge. We find that most models perform well on reasoning tasks involving only temporal knowledge and that overall performance improves with scale. However, performance remains constrained in tasks that require connecting temporal and geographical information. We do not find clear correlations of performance with specific geographic regions. Instead, we find a significant performance increase for location names with low model perplexity, suggesting their repeated occurrence during model training. We further demonstrate that their performance is heavily influenced by prompt formulation - a direct injection of geographical knowledge leads to performance gains, whereas, surprisingly, techniques like chain-of-thought prompting decrease performance on simpler tasks.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes Causality-Aware contrastive learning for RObust multivariate Time-Series (CAROTS), a novel MTSAD pipeline that incorporates the notion of causality into contrastive learning. CAROTS employs two data augmentors to obtain causality-preserving and -disturbing samples that serve as a wide range of normal variations and synthetic anomalies, respectively. With causality-preserving and -disturbing samples as positives and negatives, CAROTS performs contrastive learning to train an encoder whose latent space separates normal and abnormal samples based on causality. Moreover, CAROTS introduces a similarity-filtered one-class contrastive loss that encourages the contrastive learning process to gradually incorporate more semantically diverse samples with common causal relationships. Extensive experiments on five real-world and two synthetic datasets validate that the integration of causal relationships endows CAROTS with improved MTSAD capabilities.

Unfortunately they work for small data only. In turn they are not attractive to offer reasons for events, e.g., tracking causal changes over multiple time steps, or a behavioral component that involves feedback loops through actions of an agent. To this end, we generalize SCEs to a (recursive) formulation of explanation trees to capture the temporal interactions between reasons. We show the benefits of this more general SCE algorithm on synthetic time-series data and a 2D grid game, and further compare it to the base SCE and other existing methods for causal explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main paper: 9 pages, References: 2 pages, Supplementary: 9 pages.

| **[Phase-based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Humanoid Walking Stabilization with Single and Double Support Time Adjustments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03856v1)** | 2025-06-04 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.03856v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Balance control for humanoid robots has been extensively studied to enable robots to navigate in real-world environments. However, balance controllers that explicitly optimize the durations of both the single support phase, also known as step timing, and the Double Support Phase (DSP) have not been widely explored due to the inherent nonlinearity of the associated optimization problem. Consequently, many recent approaches either ignore the DSP or adjust its duration based on heuristics or on linearization techniques that rely on sequential coordination of balance strategies. This study proposes a novel phase-based nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework that simultaneously optimizes Zero Moment Point~(ZMP) modulation, step location, step timing, and DSP duration to maintain balance under external disturbances. In simulation, the proposed controller was compared with two state-of-the-art frameworks that rely on heuristics or sequential coordination of balance strategies under two scenarios: forward walking on terrain emulating compliant ground and external push recovery while walking in place. Overall, the findings suggest that the proposed method offers more flexible coordination of balance strategies than the sequential approach, and consistently outperforms the heuristic approach. The robustness and effectiveness of the proposed controller were also validated through experiments with a real humanoid robot.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Analytical Reconstruction of Periodically Deformed Objects in Time-resolved CT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03792v1)** | 2025-06-04 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.03792v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-resolved CT is an advanced measurement technique that has been widely used to observe dynamic objects, including periodically varying structures such as hearts, lungs, or hearing structures. To reconstruct these objects from CT projections, a common approach is to divide the projections into several collections based on their motion phases and perform reconstruction within each collection, assuming they originate from a static object. This describes the gating-based method, which is the standard approach for time-periodic reconstruction. However, the gating-based reconstruction algorithm only utilizes a limited subset of projections within each collection and ignores the correlation between different collections, leading to inefficient use of the radiation dose. To address this issue, we propose two analytical reconstruction pipelines in this paper, and validate them with experimental data captured using tomographic synchrotron microscopy. We demonstrate that our approaches significantly reduce random noise in the reconstructed images without blurring the sharp features of the observed objects. Equivalently, our methods can achieve the same reconstruction quality as gating-based methods but with a lower radiation dose. Our code is available at github.com/PeriodRecon.</p></details> |  |

However, prior approaches typically employ elaborate reasoning strategies regardless of question complexity, leading to low adaptability. Recent efficient test-time scaling methods introduce budget constraints or early stop mechanisms to avoid overthinking for straightforward questions. But they add human bias to the reasoning process and fail to leverage models' inherent reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we present T$^2$: Think-to-Think, a novel framework that dynamically adapts reasoning depth based on question complexity. T$^2$ leverages the insight that if an LLM can effectively solve similar questions using specific reasoning strategies, it can apply the same strategy to the original question. This insight enables to adoption of concise reasoning for straightforward questions while maintaining detailed analysis for complex problems. T$^2$ works through four key steps: decomposing questions into structural elements, generating similar examples with candidate reasoning strategies, evaluating these strategies against multiple criteria, and applying the most appropriate strategy to the original question. Experimental evaluation across seven diverse CQA benchmarks demonstrates that T$^2$ not only achieves higher accuracy than baseline methods but also reduces computational overhead by up to 25.2\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2503.22985</p></details> |

The proposed method is based on a fixed-pole observer model, which is a reasonable continuous-time version corresponding to the innovation model in discrete-time and allows the identification of unstable target systems. Furthermore, it is shown that the proposed method can be attributed to a convex optimization problem by fixing the observer poles. The method is within the framework of the stabilized output error method and shares usability advantages such as robustness to noise with complex dynamics and applicability to a wide class of models. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated through numerical examples.</p></details> | 6 pages, 7 figures |

Although YOLO-series models have set strong benchmarks by balancing speed and accuracy, the increasing need for richer global context modeling has led to the use of Transformer-based architectures. Nevertheless, Transformers have high computational complexity because of their self-attention mechanism, which limits their practicality for real-time and edge deployments. To overcome these challenges, recent developments in linear state space models, such as Mamba, provide a promising alternative by enabling efficient sequence modeling with linear complexity. Building on this insight, we propose MambaNeXt-YOLO, a novel object detection framework that balances accuracy and efficiency through three key contributions: (1) MambaNeXt Block: a hybrid design that integrates CNNs with Mamba to effectively capture both local features and long-range dependencies; (2) Multi-branch Asymmetric Fusion Pyramid Network (MAFPN): an enhanced feature pyramid architecture that improves multi-scale object detection across various object sizes; and (3) Edge-focused Efficiency: our method achieved 66.6\% mAP at 31.9 FPS on the PASCAL VOC dataset without any pre-training and supports deployment on edge devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX and Orin NX.</p></details> |  |

We consider not only redundancy-oblivious policies, such as FCFS and ROS, but also redundancy-aware policies of the form $\Pi$ 1 -- $\Pi$ 2 , where $\Pi$ 1 discriminates among job classes (e.g., least-redundant-first (LRF), most-redundantfirst (MRF)) and $\Pi$ 2 discriminates among jobs of the same class. Assuming that jobs have independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) copies, we prove the following: (i) When jobs have exponential service times, LRF policies outperform any other policy. (ii) When service times are New-Worse-than-Used, MRF-FCFS outperforms LRF-FCFS as the variability of the service time grows infinitely large. (iii) When service times are New-Better-than-Used, LRF-ROS (resp. MRF-ROS) outperforms LRF-FCFS (resp. MRF-FCFS) in a two-server system. Statement (iii) also holds when job sizes follow a general distribution and have identical copies (all the copies of a job have the same size). Moreover, we show via simulation that, for a large class of redundancy systems, redundancy-aware policies can considerably improve the mean response time compared to redundancy-oblivious policies. We also explore the effect of redundancy on the stability region.</p></details> |  |

Previous approaches mainly focused on sample selection strategies, while overlooking the fundamental problem on underlying optimization. Initially, we critically analyze the widely-adopted entropy minimization framework in WTTA and uncover its significant limitations in noisy optimization dynamics that substantially hinder adaptation efficiency. Through our analysis, we identify region confidence as a superior alternative to traditional entropy, however, its direct optimization remains computationally prohibitive for real-time applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel region-integrated method ReCAP that bypasses the lengthy process. Specifically, we propose a probabilistic region modeling scheme that flexibly captures semantic changes in embedding space. Subsequently, we develop a finite-to-infinite asymptotic approximation that transforms the intractable region confidence into a tractable and upper-bounded proxy. These innovations significantly unlock the overlooked potential dynamics in local region in a concise solution. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the consistent superiority of ReCAP over existing methods across various datasets and wild scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2025</p></details> |

Monte Carlo Dropout is a widely used technique for approximating predictive uncertainty by performing stochastic forward passes with dropout during inference. However, using static dropout rates across all layers and inputs can lead to suboptimal uncertainty estimates, as it fails to adapt to the varying characteristics of individual inputs and network layers. Existing approaches optimize dropout rates during training using labeled data, resulting in fixed inference-time parameters that cannot adjust to new data distributions, compromising uncertainty estimates in Monte Carlo simulations. In this paper, we propose Rate-In, an algorithm that dynamically adjusts dropout rates during inference by quantifying the information loss induced by dropout in each layer's feature maps. By treating dropout as controlled noise injection and leveraging information-theoretic principles, Rate-In adapts dropout rates per layer and per input instance without requiring ground truth labels. By quantifying the functional information loss in feature maps, we adaptively tune dropout rates to maintain perceptual quality across diverse medical imaging tasks and architectural configurations. Our extensive empirical study on synthetic data and real-world medical imaging tasks demonstrates that Rate-In improves calibration and sharpens uncertainty estimates compared to fixed or heuristic dropout rates without compromising predictive performance. Rate-In offers a practical, unsupervised, inference-time approach to optimizing dropout for more reliable predictive uncertainty estimation in critical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2025.

We study information leakage for a special class of real-time tasks that have two execution modes, namely, typical execution (which invokes the majority of times) and critical execution (to tackle exceptional conditions). The data flow-driven applications inherit such a multimode execution model. In this paper, we investigate whether a low-priority "observer" task can infer the execution patterns of a high-priority "victim" task (especially the critical executions). We develop a new statistical analysis technique and show that by analyzing the response times of the low-priority task, it becomes possible to extract the execution behavior of the high-priority task. We test our approach against a random selection technique that arbitrarily classifies a job as critical. We find that correlating the observer's response times with the victim's jobs can result in higher precision in identifying critical invocations compared to a random guess. We conduct extensive evaluations with systemically generated workloads, including a case study using a UAV autopilot (ArduPilot) taskset parameters. We found that our inference algorithm can achieve relatively low false positive rates (less than 25%) with relatively low footprint (1 MB memory and 50 ms timing overhead on a Raspberry Pi 4 platform). We further demonstrate the feasibility of inference on two cyber-physical platforms: an off-the-shelf manufacturing robot and a custom-built surveillance system.</p></details> |  |

Recently, there has been initial exploration of applying diffusion models to time series tasks. However, existing studies still face challenges in multi-scale feature alignment and generative capabilities across different entities and long-time scales. In this paper, we propose CHIME, a conditional hallucination and integrated multi-scale enhancement framework for time series diffusion models. By employing multi-scale decomposition and adaptive integration, CHIME captures the decomposed features of time series, achieving in-domain distribution alignment between generated and original samples. In addition, we introduce a feature hallucination module in the conditional denoising process, enabling the transfer of temporal features through the training of category-independent transformation layers.

However, rendering city-scale 3DGS scenes on mobile devices, e.g., your smartphones, remains a significant challenge due to the limited resources on mobile devices. A natural solution is to offload computation to the cloud; however, naively streaming rendered frames from the cloud to the client introduces high latency and requires bandwidth far beyond the capacity of current wireless networks. In this paper, we propose an effective solution to enable city-scale 3DGS rendering on mobile devices. Our key insight is that, under normal user motion, the number of newly visible Gaussians per second remains roughly constant. Leveraging this, we stream only the necessary Gaussians to the client. Specifically, on the cloud side, we propose asynchronous level-of-detail search to identify the necessary Gaussians for the client. On the client side, we accelerate rendering via a lookup table-based rasterization. Combined with holistic runtime optimizations, our system can deliver low-latency, city-scale 3DGS rendering on mobile devices. Compared to existing solutions, Voyager achieves over 100$\times$ reduction on data transfer and up to 8.9$\times$ speedup while retaining comparable rendering quality.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce VISTA (Vision-Language Inference for Stock Time-series Analysis), a novel, training-free framework that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for multi-modal stock forecasting. VISTA prompts a VLM with both textual representations of historical stock prices and their corresponding line charts to predict future price values. By combining numerical and visual modalities in a zero-shot setting and using carefully designed chain-of-thought prompts, VISTA captures complementary patterns that unimodal approaches often miss. We benchmark VISTA against standard baselines, including ARIMA and text-only LLM-based prompting methods. Experimental results show that VISTA outperforms these baselines by up to 89.83%, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal inference for stock time-series analysis and highlighting the potential of VLMs in financial forecasting tasks without requiring task-specific training.</p></details> |  |

However, their internal representations and learned concepts are still not well understood. In this study, we investigate the structure and redundancy of representations across various TSFMs, examining the self-similarity of model layers within and across different model sizes. This analysis reveals block-like redundancy in the representations, which can be utilized for informed pruning to improve inference speed and efficiency. Additionally, we explore the concepts learned by these models - such as periodicity and trends - and how these can be manipulated through latent space steering to influence model behavior. Our experiments show that steering interventions can introduce new features, e.g., adding periodicity or trends to signals that initially lacked them. These findings underscore the value of representational analysis for optimizing models and demonstrate how conceptual steering offers new possibilities for more controlled and efficient time series analysis with TSFMs.</p></details> | Accepted at ICML'25 |

This process necessitates training an aligned version for every base model, resulting in significant computational overhead. In this work, we propose NUDGING, a simple, training-free algorithm that aligns any base model at inference time using a small aligned model. NUDGING is motivated by recent findings that alignment primarily alters the model's behavior on a small subset of stylistic tokens (e.g., discourse markers). We find that base models are significantly more uncertain when generating these tokens. Building on this insight, NUDGING employs a small aligned model to generate nudging tokens to guide the base model's output during decoding when the base model's uncertainty is high, with only a minor additional inference overhead. We evaluate NUDGING across 3 model families on a diverse range of open-instruction tasks. Without any training, nudging a large base model with a 7x-14x smaller aligned model achieves zero-shot performance comparable to, and sometimes surpassing, that of large aligned models. By operating at the token level, NUDGING enables off-the-shelf collaboration between model families. For instance, nudging Gemma-2-27b with Llama-27b-chat outperforms Llama-2-70b-chat on various tasks. Overall, our work offers a modular and cost-efficient solution to LLM alignment.

We tackle this deficiency by first providing a critical analysis of existing benchmarks and models. We then introduce ArrowRL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based training strategy with an innovative reverse reward that instills AoT awareness by encouraging divergent video interpretations between forward and reversed visual frames. For rigorous evaluation, we additionally develop AoTBench, a new multi-faceted benchmark probing temporally challenging questions. Experiments show ArrowRL greatly advances temporal perception: it not only achieves substantial improvements on our challenging AoTBench but also demonstrably boosts performance on standard video question answering (VQA) benchmarks (with peak accuracy gains reaching over 20% and 10% respectively). This validates ArrowRL's effectiveness and highlights the critical need for dedicated AoT understanding in LMMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://vision.cs.utexas.edu/projects/SeeAoT</p></details> |
| **[How Two-Layer Neural Networks Learn, One (Giant) Step at a Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18270v4)** | 2025-06-03 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2305.18270v4) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For high-dimensional Gaussian data, we investigate theoretically how the features of a two-layer neural network adapt to the structure of the target function through a few large batch gradient descent steps, leading to an improvement in the approximation capacity from initialization. First, we compare the influence of batch size to that of multiple steps. For a single step, a batch of size $n = \mathcal{O}(d)$ is both necessary and sufficient to align with the target function, although only a single direction can be learned. In contrast, $n = \mathcal{O}(d^2)$ is essential for neurons to specialize in multiple relevant directions of the target with a single gradient step. Even in this case, we show there might exist ``hard'' directions requiring $n = \mathcal{O}(d^\ell)$ samples to be learned, where $\ell$ is known as the leap index of the target. Second, we show that the picture drastically improves over multiple gradient steps: a batch size of $n = \mathcal{O}(d)$ is indeed sufficient to learn multiple target directions satisfying a staircase property, where more and more directions can be learned over time. Finally, we discuss how these directions allow for a drastic improvement in the approximation capacity and generalization error over the initialization, illustrating a separation of scale between the random features/lazy regime and the feature learning regime. Our technical analysis leverages a combination of techniques related to concentration, projection-based conditioning, and Gaussian equivalence, which we believe are of independent interest. By pinning down the conditions necessary for specialization and learning, our results highlight the intertwined role of the structure of the task to learn, the details of the algorithm, and the architecture, shedding new light on how neural networks adapt to the feature and learn complex task from data over time.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Necessity of Multi-Domain Explanation: An Uncertainty Principle Approach for Deep Time Series Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03267v1)** | 2025-06-03 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.03267v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A prevailing approach to explain time series models is to generate attribution in time domain. A recent development in time series XAI is the concept of explanation spaces, where any model trained in the time domain can be interpreted with any existing XAI method in alternative domains, such as frequency. The prevailing approach is to present XAI attributions either in the time domain or in the domain where the attribution is most sparse. In this paper, we demonstrate that in certain cases, XAI methods can generate attributions that highlight fundamentally different features in the time and frequency domains that are not direct counterparts of one another. This suggests that both domains' attributions should be presented to achieve a more comprehensive interpretation. Thus it shows the necessity of multi-domain explanation. To quantify when such cases arise, we introduce the uncertainty principle (UP), originally developed in quantum mechanics and later studied in harmonic analysis and signal processing, to the XAI literature. This principle establishes a lower bound on how much a signal can be simultaneously localized in both the time and frequency domains. By leveraging this concept, we assess whether attributions in the time and frequency domains violate this bound, indicating that they emphasize distinct features. In other words, UP provides a sufficient condition that the time and frequency domain explanations do not match and, hence, should be both presented to the end user. We validate the effectiveness of this approach across various deep learning models, XAI methods, and a wide range of classification and forecasting datasets. The frequent occurrence of UP violations across various datasets and XAI methods highlights the limitations of existing approaches that focus solely on time-domain explanations. This underscores the need for multi-domain explanations as a new paradigm.</p></details> |  |

However, existing pretrained models either do not support covariates or fail to incorporate them effectively.

To address the challenge of data scarcity, we propose Informative Covariate Augmentation, which enables the training of COSMIC without requiring any datasets that include covariates. COSMIC achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot forecasting, both with and without covariates. Our quantitative and qualitative analysis demonstrates that COSMIC effectively leverages covariates in zero-shot forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was written at the end of 2024</p></details> |

However, the plethora of model formulations, the inconsistent use of terminology, and the various inferential approaches and software packages can be overwhelming to practitioners, especially when they are new to this area. With this review-like paper, we thus aim to provide guidance for both statisticians and practitioners working with latent Markov models by offering a unifying view on what otherwise are often considered separate model classes, from hidden Markov models over state-space models to Markov-modulated Poisson processes. In particular, we provide a roadmap for identifying a suitable latent Markov model formulation given the data to be analysed. Furthermore, we emphasise that it is key to applied work with any of these model classes to understand how recursive techniques exploiting the models' dependence structure can be used for inference. The R package LaMa adapts this unified view and provides an easy-to-use framework for very fast (C++ based) numerical maximum likelihood estimation of any of the models discussed in this paper, allowing users to tailor a latent Markov model to their data using a Lego-type approach.</p></details> | 52 pages, 7 figures |

However, integrating semantic information into this representation remains a significant challenge, especially in maintaining real-time performance for SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) applications. In this work, we introduce LEG-SLAM -- a novel approach that fuses an optimized Gaussian Splatting implementation with visual-language feature extraction using DINOv2 followed by a learnable feature compressor based on Principal Component Analysis, while enabling an online dense SLAM. Our method simultaneously generates high-quality photorealistic images and semantically labeled scene maps, achieving real-time scene reconstruction with more than 10 fps on the Replica dataset and 18 fps on ScanNet. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction speed while achieving competitive rendering quality. The proposed system eliminates the need for prior data preparation such as camera's ego motion or pre-computed static semantic maps. With its potential applications in autonomous robotics, augmented reality, and other interactive domains, LEG-SLAM represents a significant step forward in real-time semantic 3D Gaussian-based SLAM.

Solving a quantum computational problem with such variational methods relies on minimising some cost function, e.g., the energy of a physical system. As such, this is similar to the training process in machine learning and variational quantum simulations can therefore suffer from similar problems encountered in machine learning training. This includes non-convergence to the global minimum due to local minima as well as critical slowing down. In this article, we analyse the imaginary time evolution as a means of compiling parametric quantum circuits and finding optimal parameters, and show that it guarantees convergence to the global minimum without critical slowing down. We also show that the compilation process, including the task of finding optimal parameters, can be performed efficiently up to an arbitrary error threshold if the underlying physical system is of bounded order. This includes many relevant computational problems, e.g., local physical theories and combinatorial optimisation problems such as the flight-to-gate assignment problem. In particular, we show a priori estimates on the success probability for these combinatorial optimisation problems. There seem to be no known classical methods with similar efficiency and convergence guarantees. Meanwhile the imaginary time evolution method can be implemented on current quantum computers.</p></details> | 15 pages |

However, their robustness to adversarial manipulation remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the adversarial vulnerabilities of tabular FM, focusing on both their fragility to targeted test-time attacks and their potential misuse as adversarial tools. We show on three benchmarks in finance, cybersecurity and healthcare, that small, structured perturbations to test inputs can significantly degrade prediction accuracy, even when training context remain fixed. Additionally, we demonstrate that tabular FM can be repurposed to generate transferable evasion to conventional models such as random forests and XGBoost, and on a lesser extent to deep tabular models. To improve tabular FM, we formulate the robustification problem as an optimization of the weights (adversarial fine-tuning), or the context (adversarial in-context learning). We introduce an in-context adversarial training strategy that incrementally replaces the context with adversarial perturbed instances, without updating model weights. Our approach improves robustness across multiple tabular benchmarks. Together, these findings position tabular FM as both a target and a source of adversarial threats, highlighting the urgent need for robust training and evaluation practices in this emerging paradigm.</p></details> |  |

Firstly, the basic information and transaction data of popular NFTs on the Solana chain are collected using the Selenium tool. Secondly, the transaction records of the Magic Eden trading market are thoroughly analyzed by combining them with the Scrapy framework to examine the price fluctuations and market trends of NFTs. In terms of data analysis, this paper employs time series analysis to examine the dynamics of the NFT market and seeks to identify potential price patterns. In addition, the risk and return of different NFTs are evaluated using the mean-variance optimization model, taking into account their characteristics, such as illiquidity and market volatility, to provide investors with data-driven portfolio recommendations. The experimental results show that the combination of crawler technology and financial analytics can effectively analyze NFT data on the Solana blockchain and provide timely market insights and investment strategies. This study provides a reference for further exploration in the field of digital currencies.</p></details> |  |

Existing CTTA methods mostly focus on adaptation to the current test domain only, overlooking generalization to arbitrary test domains a model may face in the future. To tackle this limitation, we present a novel online test-time domain generalization framework for CTTA, dubbed TestDG. TestDG aims to learn features invariant to both current and previous test domains on the fly during testing, improving the potential for effective generalization to future domains. To this end, we propose a new model architecture and a test-time adaptation strategy dedicated to learning domain-invariant features, along with a new data structure and optimization algorithm for effectively managing information from previous test domains. TestDG achieved state of the art on four public CTTA benchmarks. Moreover, it showed superior generalization to unseen test domains.</p></details> |  |

However, its performance suffers under arbitrarily heterogeneous computation times across workers, leading to suboptimal time complexity and inefficiency as the number of workers scales. While several Asynchronous SGD variants have been proposed, recent findings by Tyurin & Richt\'arik (NeurIPS 2023) reveal that none achieve optimal time complexity, leaving a significant gap in the literature. In this paper, we propose Ringmaster ASGD, a novel Asynchronous SGD method designed to address these limitations and tame the inherent challenges of Asynchronous SGD. We establish, through rigorous theoretical analysis, that Ringmaster ASGD achieves optimal time complexity under arbitrarily heterogeneous and dynamically fluctuating worker computation times. This makes it the first Asynchronous SGD method to meet the theoretical lower bounds for time complexity in such scenarios.</p></details> |  |

By discretizing the continuous target space into bins and predicting over a fixed set of classes, these approaches benefit from stable training, robust uncertainty modeling, and compatibility with modern deep learning architectures. However, most existing methods rely on one-hot encoding that ignores the inherent ordinal structure of the underlying values. As a result, they fail to provide information about the relative distance between predicted and true values during training. In this paper, we propose to address this limitation by introducing binary cumulative encoding (BCE), that represents scalar targets into monotonic binary vectors. This encoding implicitly preserves order and magnitude information, allowing the model to learn distance-aware representations while still operating within a classification framework. We propose a convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed for BCE, incorporating residual and dilated convolutions to enable fast and expressive temporal modeling. Through extensive experiments on benchmark forecasting datasets, we show that our approach outperforms widely used methods in both point and probabilistic forecasting, while requiring fewer parameters and enabling faster training.</p></details> |  |

One way to speed up self-attention is to employ GPU-compatible vector search algorithms based on standard partitioning methods such as k-means. However, such partitioning methods yield poor results in this context because (1) the keys and queries follow different distributions, and (2) the RoPE positional encoding hinders the bucket assignment. This paper introduces Saap (Self-Attention with Asymmetric Partitions), which overcomes these problems. It is an asymmetrical indexing technique that employs distinct partitions for keys and queries, thereby approximating self-attention with a data-adaptive sparsity pattern. It works on pretrained language models and only requires to train (offline) a small query classifier. On a long context Llama 3.1-8b model, with sequences ranging from 100k to 500k tokens, Saap typically reduces by a factor of 20 the fraction of memory that needs to be looked-up, which translates to a time saving of 60\% when compared to FlashAttention-v2.</p></details> |  |

Due to the time-intensive nature of shapelet discovery, existing shapelet-based methods mainly focus on selecting discriminative shapes while discarding others to achieve candidate subsequence sparsification. However, this approach may exclude beneficial shapes and overlook the varying contributions of shapelets to classification performance. To this end, we propose a Soft sparse Shapes (SoftShape) model for efficient time series classification. Our approach mainly introduces soft shape sparsification and soft shape learning blocks. The former transforms shapes into soft representations based on classification contribution scores, merging lower-scored ones into a single shape to retain and differentiate all subsequence information. The latter facilitates intra- and inter-shape temporal pattern learning, improving model efficiency by using sparsified soft shapes as inputs. Specifically, we employ a learnable router to activate a subset of class-specific expert networks for intra-shape pattern learning. Meanwhile, a shared expert network learns inter-shape patterns by converting sparsified shapes into sequences. Extensive experiments show that SoftShape outperforms state-of-the-art methods and produces interpretable results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICML 2025</p></details> |

These models leverage the self-attention mechanism to capture long-term temporal or variate dependencies in sequences. Existing methods can be divided into two approaches: (1) reducing computational cost of attention by making the calculations sparse, and (2) reshaping the input data to aggregate temporal features. However, existing attention mechanisms may not adequately capture inherent nonlinear dependencies present in time series data, leaving room for improvement. In this study, we propose a novel attention mechanism based on Chatterjee's rank correlation coefficient, which measures nonlinear dependencies between variables. Specifically, we replace the matrix multiplication in standard attention mechanisms with this rank coefficient to measure the query-key relationship. Since computing Chatterjee's correlation coefficient involves sorting and ranking operations, we introduce a differentiable approximation employing SoftSort and SoftRank. Our proposed mechanism, ``XicorAttention,'' integrates it into several state-of-the-art Transformer models. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that incorporating nonlinear correlation into the attention improves forecasting accuracy by up to approximately 9.1\% compared to existing models.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often incur substantial computational costs and exhibit poor scalability, primarily due to sample-wise adaptation granularity and reliance on costly auxiliary designs such as data augmentation. To address these limitations, we introduce SAIL (Small Aid, Big Leap), a novel adapter-based TTA framework that leverages a lightweight, learnable AdaptNet to enable efficient and scalable model adaptation. As SAIL's core, a frozen pre-trained VLM collaborates with AdaptNet through a confidence-based interpolation weight, generating robust predictions during inference. These predictions serve as self-supervised targets to align AdaptNet's outputs through efficient batch-wise processing, dramatically reducing computational costs without modifying the VLM or requiring memory caches. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting during continual adaptation, we propose a gradient-aware reset strategy driven by a gradient drift indicator (GDI), which dynamically detects domain transitions and strategically resets AdaptNet for stable adaptation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks on two scenarios demonstrate that SAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining low computational costs. These results highlight SAIL's effectiveness, efficiency and scalability for real-world deployment. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Our method features (i) a reformulation of INSE so that the velocity divergence decays exponentially on the coarsest level, (ii) a derivation of coarse-fine interface conditions that preserves the decay of velocity divergence on any refinement level of the AMR hierarchy, (iii) an approximation of the coarse-fine interface conditions via spatiotemporal interpolations to facilitate subcycling in time, (iv) enforcing to machine precision solvability conditions of elliptic equations over each connected component of the subdomain covered by any refinement level, (v) a composite projection for synchronizing multiple levels, and (vi) geometric multigrid for solving linear systems with optimal complexity. Different from current block-structured AMR algorithms, our method never adopts refluxing at the coarse-fine interface, nor is fine-to-coarse averaging applied to projected velocities. Results of numerical tests demonstrate the high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present OmniTalker, a unified framework that jointly generates synchronized talking audio-video content from input text while emulating the speaking and facial movement styles of the target identity, including speech characteristics, head motion, and facial dynamics. Our framework adopts a dual-branch diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture, with one branch dedicated to audio generation and the other to video synthesis. At the shallow layers, cross-modal fusion modules are introduced to integrate information between the two modalities. In deeper layers, each modality is processed independently, with the generated audio decoded by a vocoder and the video rendered using a GAN-based high-quality visual renderer. Leveraging the in-context learning capability of DiT through a masked-infilling strategy, our model can simultaneously capture both audio and visual styles without requiring explicit style extraction modules. Thanks to the efficiency of the DiT backbone and the optimized visual renderer, OmniTalker achieves real-time inference at 25 FPS. To the best of our knowledge, OmniTalker is the first one-shot framework capable of jointly modeling speech and facial styles in real time. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority over existing methods in terms of generation quality, particularly in preserving style consistency and ensuring precise audio-video synchronization, all while maintaining efficient inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page https://humanaigc.github.io/omnitalker</p></details> |

Commercial systems are rarely open source, offer little expandability, and have shortcomings in node synchronisation, data throughput, placement clarity, setup complexity, and cost. As a result, only a few intuitively placed sensors are often used, and field trials are generally reduced. HARNode addresses these obstacles as a fully open-source hardware and software platform for rapid field applications. Each sensor node combines an ESP32-S3 module (AtomS3) with a display, a 9-axis IMU (Bosch BMX160), pressure/temperature sensors (Bosch BMP388) and an I2C port for extensions; the operating time is up to 8 hours. Data is streamed via Wi-Fi, while NTP-based time synchronisation provides an average clock accuracy of $\approx$ 1 ms. Manufacturing is carried out exclusively with commercially available components, an online PCB service - requiring little hardware knowledge - and a compact, 3D-printed housing with Velcro straps, allowing almost any number of highly synchronised nodes to be flexibly attached to the body. Its performance was demonstrated in a proof-of-concept study with ten test subjects, each wearing eleven HARNodes; the entire setup took less than five minutes per person. An example application goal was to detect the transition from level walking to climbing stairs. A random forest classifier evaluated the benefits of sensor overprovisioning: the best combination of seven nodes achieved $\approx$ 98\% accuracy (binary: level walking vs. approaching stairs), matching the result of all eleven positions. A single sensor on the foot achieved $\approx$ 90\% accuracy. These results demonstrate the suitability of HARNode as an ultra-fast ad hoc field system and support evidence-based sensor placement.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

However, due to the temporal variations and dynamic spatial correlations of traffic data, traffic prediction remains highly challenging.Traditional spatiotemporal networks, which rely on end-to-end training, often struggle to handle the diverse data dependencies of multiple traffic flow patterns. Additionally, traffic flow variations are highly sensitive to temporal information changes. Regrettably, other researchers have not sufficiently recognized the importance of temporal information.To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called A Time-Enhanced Data Disentanglement Network for Traffic Flow Forecasting (TEDDN). This network disentangles the originally complex and intertwined traffic data into stable patterns and trends. By flexibly learning temporal and node information through a dynamic graph enhanced by a temporal feature extraction module, TEDDN demonstrates significant efficacy in disentangling and extracting complex traffic information. Experimental evaluations and ablation studies on four real-world datasets validate the superiority of our method.</p></details> |  |

Being available to users from diverse cultural backgrounds, large language models (LLMs) should also be able to provide accurate information irrespective of the measurement system at hand. Using newly compiled datasets we test if this is the case for seven open-source LLMs, addressing three key research questions: (RQ1) What is the default system used by LLMs for each type of measurement? (RQ2) Do LLMs' answers and their accuracy vary across different measurement systems? (RQ3) Can LLMs mitigate potential challenges w.r.t. underrepresented systems via reasoning? Our findings show that LLMs default to the measurement system predominantly used in the data. Additionally, we observe considerable instability and variance in performance across different measurement systems. While this instability can in part be mitigated by employing reasoning methods such as chain-of-thought (CoT), this implies longer responses and thereby significantly increases test-time compute (and inference costs), marginalizing users from cultural backgrounds that use underrepresented measurement systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Main (Camera-Ready Version)</p></details> |

However, most existing approaches struggle to fully capture the complex and structured dependencies inherent in time series data. In this work, we identify and formally define three critical dependencies that are fundamental to forecasting accuracy: order dependency and semantic dependency along the temporal dimension, as well as cross-variate dependency across the feature dimension. These dependencies are often treated in isolation, and improper handling can introduce noise and degrade forecasting performance. To bridge this gap, we investigate the potential of State Space Models (SSMs) for LTSF and emphasize their inherent advantages in capturing these essential dependencies. Additionally, we empirically observe that excessive nonlinearity in conventional SSMs introduce redundancy when applied to semantically sparse time series data. Motivated by this insight, we propose SDE (Simplified and Disentangled Dependency Encoding), a novel framework designed to enhance the capability of SSMs for LTSF. Specifically, we first eliminate unnecessary nonlinearities in vanilla SSMs, thereby improving the suitability for time series forecasting. Building on this foundation, we introduce a disentangled encoding strategy, which empowers SSMs to efficiently model cross-variate dependencies while mitigating interference between the temporal and feature dimensions. Furthermore, we provide rigorous theoretical justifications to substantiate our design choices. Extensive experiments on nine real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that SDE-enhanced SSMs consistently outperform state-of-the-art time series forecasting models.Our code is available at https://github.com/YukinoAsuna/SAMBA.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |

Most existing CTTA-OD methods prioritize effectiveness while overlooking computational efficiency, which is crucial for resource-constrained scenarios. In this paper, we propose an efficient CTTA-OD method via pruning. Our motivation stems from the observation that not all learned source features are beneficial; certain domain-sensitive feature channels can adversely affect target domain performance. Inspired by this, we introduce a sensitivity-guided channel pruning strategy that quantifies each channel based on its sensitivity to domain discrepancies at both image and instance levels. We apply weighted sparsity regularization to selectively suppress and prune these sensitive channels, focusing adaptation efforts on invariant ones. Additionally, we introduce a stochastic channel reactivation mechanism to restore pruned channels, enabling recovery of potentially useful features and mitigating the risks of early pruning. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show that our method achieves superior adaptation performance while reducing computational overhead by 12% in FLOPs compared to the recent SOTA method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as CVPR 2025 oral paper</p></details> |

Most existing methods focus on exploiting target data, while overlooking another crucial source of information, the pre-trained weights, which encode underutilized domain-invariant priors. This paper takes the geometric attributes of pre-trained weights as a starting point, systematically analyzing three key components: magnitude, absolute angle, and pairwise angular structure. We find that the pairwise angular structure remains stable across diverse corrupted domains and encodes domain-invariant semantic information, suggesting it should be preserved during adaptation. Based on this insight, we propose PAID (Pairwise Angular-Invariant Decomposition), a prior-driven CTTA method that decomposes weight into magnitude and direction, and introduces a learnable orthogonal matrix via Householder reflections to globally rotate direction while preserving the pairwise angular structure. During adaptation, only the magnitudes and the orthogonal matrices are updated. PAID achieves consistent improvements over recent SOTA methods on four widely used CTTA benchmarks, demonstrating that preserving pairwise angular structure offers a simple yet effective principle for CTTA.</p></details> |  |

However, their effectiveness in handling complex, noisy, and multivariate time-series data remains underexplored. To address this, we propose LLMPred which enhances LLM-based time-series prediction by converting time-series sequences into text and feeding them to LLMs for zero shot prediction along with two main data pre-processing techniques. First, we apply time-series sequence decomposition to facilitate accurate prediction on complex and noisy univariate sequences. Second, we extend this univariate prediction capability to multivariate data using a lightweight prompt-processing strategy. Extensive experiments with smaller LLMs such as Llama 2 7B, Llama 3.2 3B, GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek 7B demonstrate that LLMPred achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, a thorough ablation study highlights the importance of the key components proposed in LLMPred.</p></details> |  |

The classical approaches suffer from the triple problems of decoupled of task assignment and path planning, poor real-time performance and limited adaptability. Aiming at these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamic real-time multi-UAV collaborative mission planning algorithm based on Dubins paths under a distributed formation structure. Dubins path with multiple advantages bridges the gap between task assignment and path planning, leading to a coupled solution for mission planning. Then, a series of acceleration techniques, task clustering preprocessing, highly efficient distance cost functions, low-complexity and less iterative task allocation strategies, are employed to guarantee the real-time performance of the algorithms. To cope with different emergencies and their simultaneous extremes, real-time planning of emerging tasks and mission replanning due to the reduction of available UAVs are appropriately handled. Finally, the developed algorithm is comprehensively exemplified and studied through simulations, highlighting that the proposed method only sacrifices 9.57% of the path length, while achieving a speed improvement of 4-5 orders of magnitude over the simulated annealing method, with a single mission planning of about 0.0003s.</p></details> |  |

Unlike state-of-the-art methods based on reduction rules or separators, \textsc{H-Td} exploits the structural properties of Halin graphs. Although two theoretical linear-time algorithms exist that can be applied to graphs of treewidth three, no practical implementation has been made publicly available. Furthermore, extending reduction-based approaches to partial $k$-trees with $k > 3$ results in increasingly complex rules that are challenging to implement. This motivates the exploration of alternative strategies that leverage structural insights specific to certain graph classes. Experimental validation against the winners of the Parameterized Algorithms and Computational Experiments Challenge (PACE) 2017 and the treewidth library \texttt{libtw} demonstrates the advantage of \textsc{H-Td} when the input is known to be a Halin graph.</p></details> |  |

However, many real-world environmental datasets, such as those collected by spacecraft monitoring the solar wind, contain gaps, which inevitably corrupt the statistics. The nature of this corruption for structure functions remains poorly understood - indeed, often overlooked. Here we simulate gaps in a large set of magnetic field intervals from Parker Solar Probe in order to characterize the behaviour of the structure function of a sparse time series of solar wind turbulence. We quantify the resultant error with regards to the overall shape of the structure function, and its slope in the inertial range. Noting the consistent underestimation of the true curve when using linear interpolation, we demonstrate the ability of an empirical correction factor to de-bias these estimates. This correction, "learnt" from the data from a single spacecraft, is shown to generalize well to data from a solar wind regime elsewhere in the heliosphere, producing smaller errors, on average, for missing fractions >25%. Given this success, we apply the correction to gap-affected Voyager intervals from the inner heliosheath and local interstellar medium, obtaining spectral indices similar to those from previous studies. This work provides a tool for future studies of fragmented solar wind time series, such as those from Voyager, MAVEN, and OMNI, as well as sparsely-sampled astrophysical and geophysical processes more generally.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Many real-life scenarios, such as public health, economics, and social applications, involve feedback loops where predictions can influence the predicted outcome, subsequently altering the target variable's distribution. This phenomenon, known as performativity, introduces the potential for 'self-negating' or 'self-fulfilling' predictions. Despite extensive studies in classification problems across domains, performativity remains largely unexplored in the context of time-series forecasting from a machine-learning perspective. In this paper, we formalize performative time-series forecasting (PeTS), addressing the challenge of accurate predictions when performativity-induced distribution shifts are possible. We propose a novel approach, Feature Performative-Shifting (FPS), which leverages the concept of delayed response to anticipate distribution shifts and subsequently predicts targets accordingly. We provide theoretical insights suggesting that FPS can potentially lead to reduced generalization error. We conduct comprehensive experiments using multiple time-series models on COVID-19 and traffic forecasting tasks. The results demonstrate that FPS consistently outperforms conventional time-series forecasting methods, highlighting its efficacy in handling performativity-induced challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages (8 main text, 1 reference, 3 appendix), 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Some gradient-free guidance methods have been developed, but they often struggle to achieve optimal inference-time alignment. In this work, we newly frame inference-time alignment in diffusion as a search problem and propose Dynamic Search for Diffusion (DSearch), which subsamples from denoising processes and approximates intermediate node rewards. It also dynamically adjusts beam width and tree expansion to efficiently explore high-reward generations. To refine intermediate decisions, DSearch incorporates adaptive scheduling based on noise levels and a lookahead heuristic function. We validate DSearch across multiple domains, including biological sequence design, molecular optimization, and image generation, demonstrating superior reward optimization compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

Heart rate data has shown promise in assessing patient health, and wearable devices offer a cost-effective solution for real-time monitoring. However, extracting meaningful insights from diverse heart rate data and handling missing values in wearable device data remain key challenges. To address these challenges, we propose TARL, an innovative approach that models the structural relationships of representative subsequences, known as shapelets, in heart rate time series. TARL creates a shapelet-transition knowledge graph to model shapelet dynamics in heart rate time series, indicating illness progression and potential future changes. We further introduce a transition-aware knowledge embedding to reinforce relationships among shapelets and quantify the impact of missing values, enabling the formulation of comprehensive heart rate representations. These representations capture explanatory structures and predict future heart rate trends, aiding early illness detection. We collaborate with physicians and nurses to gather ICU patient heart rate data from wearables and diagnostic metrics assessing illness severity for evaluating deterioration. Experiments on real-world ICU data demonstrate that TARL achieves both high reliability and early detection. A case study further showcases TARL's explainable detection process, highlighting its potential as an AI-driven tool to assist clinicians in recognizing early signs of patient deterioration.</p></details> |  |

We analyse a dataset tracking the social interactions of 900 individuals over four years. Despite continuous shifts in individual relationships, the macroscopic structural properties of the network remain stable, fluctuating within predictable bounds. We connect this stability to the concept of equilibrium in statistical physics. Specifically, we demonstrate that the probabilities governing network dynamics are stationary over time, and key features like degree, edge, and triangle abundances align with theoretical predictions from equilibrium dynamics. Moreover, the dynamics satisfies the detailed balance condition. Remarkably, equilibrium persists despite constant turnover as people join, leave, and change connections. This suggests that equilibrium arises not from specific individuals but from the balancing act of human needs, cognitive limits, and social pressures. Practically, this equilibrium simplifies data collection, supports methods relying on single network snapshots (like Exponential Random Graph Models), and aids in designing interventions for social challenges. Theoretically, it offers new insights into collective human behaviour, revealing how emergent properties of complex social systems can be captured by simple mathematical models.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

It requires large language models (LLMs) to engage in genuine temporal reasoning without depending on the factual knowledge acquired during the pre-training phase. Our data generation framework enables on-demand generation of new samples, mitigating the risk of data leakage. We designed three types of time-sensitive questions to test LLMs' temporal reasoning abilities over sequential and parallel event occurrences. Our evaluation of five LLMs on synthetic fact-based TSQA reveals mixed results: while they perform well on simpler subsets, their overall performance remains inferior as compared to real world fact-based TSQA. Error analysis indicates that LLMs face difficulties in reasoning over long-range event dependencies and parallel events.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACL 2025 (Main)</p></details> |

Real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) is a potential solution that can learn patterns within non-stationary respiratory data but has high complexity. This study assesses the capabilities of resource-efficient online RNN algorithms, namely unbiased online recurrent optimization (UORO), sparse-1 step approximation (SnAp-1), and decoupled neural interfaces (DNI) to forecast respiratory motion during radiotherapy treatment accurately. We use time series containing the 3D positions of external markers on the chest of healthy subjects. We propose efficient implementations for SnAp-1 and DNI that compress the influence and immediate Jacobian matrices and accurately update the linear coefficients used in credit assignment estimation, respectively. Data was originally sampled at 10Hz; we resampled it at 3.33Hz and 30Hz to analyze the effect of the sampling rate on performance. We use UORO, SnAp-1, and DNI to forecast each marker's 3D position with horizons h<=2.1s (the time interval in advance for which the prediction is made) and compare them with RTRL, least mean squares, kernel support vector regression, and linear regression. RNNs trained online achieved similar or better accuracy than most previous works using larger training databases and deep learning, even though we used only the first minute of each sequence to predict motion within that exact sequence. SnAp-1 had the lowest normalized root mean square errors (nRMSEs) averaged over the horizon values considered, equal to 0.335 and 0.157, at 3.33Hz and 10.0Hz, respectively. Similarly, UORO had the lowest nRMSE at 30Hz, equal to 0.086. DNI's inference time (6.8ms per time step at 30Hz, Intel Core i7-13700 CPU) was the lowest among the RNN methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 18 figures, accepted manuscript version</p></details> |

Do these different communication channels carry distinct information? Prior work has shown that the information carried by prosodic features is substantially redundant with that carried by the surrounding words. Here, we systematically examine the time scale of this relationship, studying how it varies with the length of past and future contexts. We find that a word's prosodic features require an extended past context (3-8 words across different features) to be reliably predicted. Given that long-scale contextual information decays in memory, prosody may facilitate communication by adding information that is locally unique. We also find that a word's prosodic features show some redundancy with future words, but only with a short scale of 1-2 words, consistent with reports of incremental short-term planning in language production. Thus, prosody may facilitate communication by helping listeners predict upcoming material. In tandem, our results highlight potentially distinct roles that prosody plays in facilitating integration of words into past contexts and in helping predict upcoming words.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures, accepted to ACL.

Training models to generate such manipulation trajectories requires a large and diverse collection of detailed manipulation demonstrations for various objects, which is nearly unfeasible to gather at scale. In this paper, we propose a framework that leverages large-scale ego- and exo-centric video datasets -- constructed globally with substantial effort -- of Exo-Ego4D to extract diverse manipulation trajectories at scale. From these extracted trajectories with the associated textual action description, we develop trajectory generation models based on visual and point cloud-based language models. In the recently proposed egocentric vision-based in-a-quality trajectory dataset of HOT3D, we confirmed that our models successfully generate valid object trajectories, establishing a training dataset and baseline models for the novel task of generating 6DoF manipulation trajectories from action descriptions in egocentric vision.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

In contrast to prior methods that address these motion types through separate modules or task-specific designs, our approach offers a cohesive solution by projecting user-defined trajectories into the latent space of pre-trained image-to-video generation models via a lightweight motion injector. Users can specify keypoints and their motion paths to control localized deformations, entire object motion, virtual camera dynamics, or combinations of these. The injected trajectory signals guide the generative process to produce temporally consistent and semantically aligned motion sequences. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple video motion control tasks, including stylized motion effects (e.g., motion brushes), dynamic viewpoint changes, and precise local motion manipulation. Experiments show that our method provides significantly better controllability and visual quality compared to prior approaches and commercial solutions, while remaining broadly compatible with various state-of-the-art video generation backbones.

Traditional site selection methods often rely on static traffic counts or subjective assessments. This research introduces a data-driven methodology to objectively quantify location visibility by analyzing large-scale connected vehicle trajectory data (sourced from Compass IoT) within urban environments. We model the dynamic driver field-of-view using a forward-projected visibility area for each vehicle position derived from interpolated trajectories. By integrating this with building vertex locations extracted from OpenStreetMap, we quantify the cumulative visual exposure, or ``visibility count'', for thousands of potential points of interest near roadways. The analysis reveals that visibility is highly concentrated, identifying specific ``visual hotspots'' that receive disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. The core technical contribution involves the construction of a BallTree spatial index over building vertices. This enables highly efficient (O(logN) complexity) radius queries to determine which vertices fall within the viewing circles of millions of trajectory points across numerous trips, significantly outperforming brute-force geometric checks. Analysis reveals two key findings: 1) Visibility is highly concentrated, identifying distinct 'visual hotspots' receiving disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. 2) The aggregated visibility counts across vertices conform to a Log-Normal distribution.</p></details> |  |

Previous works have successfully applied these in the context of robotic manipulation but perform poorly when the required solution does not exist as a complete trajectory within the training set. We identify that this is a result of being unable to plan via stitching, and subsequently address the architectural and dataset choices needed to remedy this. On top of this, we propose a novel addition to the training and inference procedures to both stabilize and enhance these capabilities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by generating plans with out of distribution boundary conditions and performing obstacle avoidance on the Franka Panda in simulation and on real hardware. In both of these tasks our method performs significantly better than the baselines and is able to avoid obstacles up to four times as large.</p></details> |  |

Complex tasks can be accomplished through iterative clarifying questions and final responses generated by an LLM acting as a questioner (STaR-GATE; Andukuri et al., 2024}). However, existing approaches based on self-taught reasoning struggle to identify optimal dialogue trajectories and avoid irrelevant questions to the tasks. To address this limitation, we propose TO-GATE, a novel framework that enhances question generation through trajectory optimization, which consists of two key components: a clarification resolver that generates optimal questioning trajectories, and a summarizer that ensures task-aligned final responses. The trajectory optimization enables the model to produce effective elicitation questions and summary responses tailored to specific tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that TO-GATE significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving a 9.32% improvement on standard preference elicitation tasks.</p></details> |  |

While effective at generating entire sequences, these models typically lack control over the timing and scope of the edits. Most existing approaches either operate on univariate sequences or assume that the condition affects all variables and time steps. However, many scientific and clinical applications require more precise interventions, where a condition takes effect only after a specific time and influences only a subset of variables. We introduce CLEF, a controllable sequence editing model for conditional generation of immediate and delayed effects in multivariate longitudinal sequences. CLEF learns temporal concepts that encode how and when a condition alters future sequence evolution. These concepts allow CLEF to apply targeted edits to the affected time steps and variables while preserving the rest of the sequence. We evaluate CLEF on 6 datasets spanning cellular reprogramming and patient health trajectories, comparing against 9 state-of-the-art baselines. CLEF improves immediate sequence editing accuracy by up to 36.01% (MAE). Unlike prior models, CLEF enables one-step conditional generation at arbitrary future times, outperforming them in delayed sequence editing by up to 65.71% (MAE). We test CLEF under counterfactual inference assumptions and show up to 63.19% (MAE) improvement on zero-shot conditional generation of counterfactual trajectories. In a case study of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, CLEF identifies clinical interventions that generate realistic counterfactual trajectories shifted toward healthier outcomes.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a novel framework for learning fixed-dimensional embeddings for short trajectories by leveraging a Transformer encoder trained with a contrastive triplet loss that emphasize the importance of discriminative feature spaces for trajectory data. We analyze the influence of Cosine and FFT-based similarity metrics within the contrastive learning paradigm, with a focus on capturing the nuanced directional intent that characterizes short-term maneuvers. Our empirical evaluation on the Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrates that embeddings shaped by Cosine similarity objectives yield superior clustering of trajectories by both semantic and directional attributes, outperforming FFT-based baselines in retrieval tasks. Notably, we show that compact Transformer architectures, even with low-dimensional embeddings (e.g., 16 dimensions, but qualitatively down to 4), achieve a compelling balance between retrieval performance (minADE, minFDE) and computational overhead, aligning with the growing demand for scalable and interpretable motion priors in real-time systems. The resulting embeddings provide a compact, semantically meaningful, and efficient representation of trajectory data, offering a robust alternative to heuristic similarity measures and paving the way for more transparent and controllable motion forecasting pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for peer review</p></details> |

The localization of point targets constitutes a fundamental problem in optical experimental mechanics, with extensive applications in various missions of UAVs. Localizing moving targets is crucial for analyzing their motion characteristics and dynamic properties. Reconstructing the trajectories of points from asynchronous cameras is a significant challenge. It encompasses two coupled sub-problems: trajectory reconstruction and camera synchronization. Present methods typically address only one of these sub-problems individually. This paper proposes a 3D trajectory reconstruction method for point targets based on asynchronous cameras, simultaneously solving both sub-problems. Firstly, we extend the trajectory intersection method to asynchronous cameras to resolve the limitation of traditional triangulation that requires camera synchronization. Secondly, we develop models for camera temporal information and target motion, based on imaging mechanisms and target dynamics characteristics. The parameters are optimized simultaneously to achieve trajectory reconstruction without accurate time parameters. Thirdly, we optimize the camera rotations alongside the camera time information and target motion parameters, using tighter and more continuous constraints on moving points. The reconstruction accuracy is significantly improved, especially when the camera rotations are inaccurate. Finally, the simulated and real-world experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method. The real-world results indicate that the proposed algorithm achieved a localization error of 112.95 m at an observation range of 15 ~ 20 km.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by Acta Mechanica Sinica</p></details> |

However, existing trajectory-based methods primarily focus on individual object motion and struggle to capture multi-object interaction crucial in complex robotic manipulation. This limitation arises from multi-feature entanglement in overlapping regions, which leads to degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we present RoboMaster, a novel framework that models inter-object dynamics through a collaborative trajectory formulation. Unlike prior methods that decompose objects, our core is to decompose the interaction process into three sub-stages: pre-interaction, interaction, and post-interaction. Each stage is modeled using the feature of the dominant object, specifically the robotic arm in the pre- and post-interaction phases and the manipulated object during interaction, thereby mitigating the drawback of multi-object feature fusion present during interaction in prior work. To further ensure subject semantic consistency throughout the video, we incorporate appearance- and shape-aware latent representations for objects. Extensive experiments on the challenging Bridge V2 dataset, as well as in-the-wild evaluation, demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in trajectory-controlled video generation for robotic manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://fuxiao0719.github.io/projects/robomaster/ Code: https://github.com/KwaiVGI/RoboMaster</p></details> |

These problems are modeled by partially observable stochastic games (POSGs), but planning in fully continuous POSGs is intractable without heavy offline computation or assumptions on the order of belief maintained by each player. We formulate a finite history/horizon refinement of POSGs which admits competitive information gathering behavior in trajectory space, and through a series of approximations, we present an online method for computing rational trajectory plans in these games which leverages particle-based estimations of the joint state space and performs stochastic gradient play. We also provide the necessary adjustments required to deploy this method on individual agents. The method is tested in continuous pursuit-evasion and warehouse-pickup scenarios (alongside extensions to $N > 2$ players and to more complex environments with visual and physical obstacles), demonstrating evidence of active information gathering and outperforming passive competitors.</p></details> | Accepted at RSS 2025 |

This arises because users frequently do not fully understand their own needs, while systems require precise intent definitions. Current LLM-based agents cannot effectively distinguish between linguistically complete and contextually triggerable expressions, lacking frameworks for collaborative intent formation. We present STORM, a framework modeling asymmetric information dynamics through conversations between UserLLM (full internal access) and AgentLLM (observable behavior only). STORM produces annotated corpora capturing expression trajectories and latent cognitive transitions, enabling systematic analysis of collaborative understanding development. Our contributions include: (1) formalizing asymmetric information processing in dialogue systems; (2) modeling intent formation tracking collaborative understanding evolution; and (3) evaluation metrics measuring internal cognitive improvements alongside task performance. Experiments across four language models reveal that moderate uncertainty (40-60%) can outperform complete transparency in certain scenarios, with model-specific patterns suggesting reconsideration of optimal information completeness in human-AI collaboration. These findings contribute to understanding asymmetric reasoning dynamics and inform uncertainty-calibrated dialogue system design.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 31 figures.

In this context, constrained diversity optimization has emerged as a powerful reinforcement learning (RL) framework to train a diverse set of agents in parallel. However, existing constrained-diversity RL methods often under-explore in complex tasks such as robotic manipulation, leading to a lack in policy diversity. To improve diversity optimization in RL, we therefore propose a curriculum that first explores at the trajectory level before learning step-based policies. In our empirical evaluation, we provide novel insights into the shortcoming of skill-based diversity optimization, and demonstrate empirically that our curriculum improves the diversity of the learned skills.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality and diversity of training data. This often restricts their generalization to tasks outside their training distribution or longer planning horizons. To overcome this challenge, we propose State-Covering Trajectory Stitching (SCoTS), a novel reward-free trajectory augmentation method that incrementally stitches together short trajectory segments, systematically generating diverse and extended trajectories. SCoTS first learns a temporal distance-preserving latent representation that captures the underlying temporal structure of the environment, then iteratively stitches trajectory segments guided by directional exploration and novelty to effectively cover and expand this latent space. We demonstrate that SCoTS significantly improves the performance and generalization capabilities of diffusion planners on offline goal-conditioned benchmarks requiring stitching and long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, augmented trajectories generated by SCoTS significantly improve the performance of widely used offline goal-conditioned RL algorithms across diverse environments.</p></details> |  |

A common approach involves collecting scenario-specific data and performing fine-tuning via backpropagation. However, this process is often impractical on edge devices due to constrained computational resources. To address this challenge, we introduce TrajICL, an In-Context Learning (ICL) framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction that enables rapid adaptation without fine-tuning on the scenario-specific data. We propose a spatio-temporal similarity-based example selection (STES) method that selects relevant examples from previously observed trajectories within the same scene by identifying similar motion patterns at corresponding locations. To further refine this selection, we introduce prediction-guided example selection (PG-ES), which selects examples based on both the past trajectory and the predicted future trajectory, rather than relying solely on the past trajectory. This approach allows the model to account for long-term dynamics when selecting examples. Finally, instead of relying on small real-world datasets with limited scenario diversity, we train our model on a large-scale synthetic dataset to enhance its prediction ability by leveraging in-context examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TrajICL achieves remarkable adaptation across both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios, outperforming even fine-tuned approaches across multiple public benchmarks. The code will be released at https://fujiry0.github.io/TrajICL-project-page.</p></details> |  |

This issue, often manifesting as hallucinations or unattributable reasoning processes, limits their applicability in complex reasoning scenarios. To address this, we propose Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning Attribution and Chain Explanation Supervision (KG-TRACES), a novel framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs through explicit supervision over reasoning paths and processes. KG-TRACES jointly supervises the model to: (1) predict symbolic relation paths, (2) predict full triple-level reasoning paths, and (3) generate attribution-aware reasoning processes grounded in the reasoning paths. At inference phase, the model adapts to both KG-available and KG-unavailable scenarios, retrieving reasoning paths from a KG when possible or predicting plausible reasoning paths with only intrinsic knowledge when not. This design enables the model to reason in an explainable and source-attributable pattern. Through extensive experiments on complex reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that KG-TRACES significantly outperforms existing SOTA: it improves Hits@1 by 1.6% and F1 by 4.7% on WebQSP, and achieves improvements of 4.8% in Hits@1 and 2.1% in F1 on CWQ. Moreover, we show its transferability to specialized domains such as medicine. By visualizing the intermediate steps of reasoning processes, we further show that the explicit supervision introduced by KG-TRACES leads to more stable and goal-directed reasoning processes, aligning closely with correct answers.

As time progresses, the amount of data fitted by the AD model expands, which helps to improve the AD model generalization substantially. However, such ever-expanding data is a double-edged sword for the AD model. Specifically, as the fitted data volume grows to exceed the the AD model's fitting capacities, the AD model is prone to under-fitting. To address this issue, we propose to use a pretrained Large Vision Models (LVMs) as backbone coupled with downstream perception head to understand AD semantic information. This design can not only surmount the aforementioned under-fitting problem due to LVMs' powerful fitting capabilities, but also enhance the perception generalization thanks to LVMs' vast and diverse training data. On the other hand, to mitigate vehicles' computational burden of training the perception head while running LVM backbone, we introduce a Posterior Optimization Trajectory (POT)-Guided optimization scheme (POTGui) to accelerate the convergence. Concretely, we propose a POT Generator (POTGen) to generate posterior (future) optimization direction in advance to guide the current optimization iteration, through which the model can generally converge within 10 epochs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the performance by over 66.48\% and converges faster over 6 times, compared to the existing state-of-the-art approach.</p></details> | 7 pages |

While open-source LMM agents have made significant advances in offline evaluation benchmarks, their performance still falls substantially short of human-level capabilities in more realistic online settings. A key bottleneck is the lack of diverse and large-scale trajectory-level datasets across various domains, which are expensive to collect. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing a scalable recipe to synthesize the largest and most diverse trajectory-level dataset to date, containing over 94K successful multimodal web trajectories, spanning 49K unique URLs, 720K screenshots, and 33M web elements. In particular, we leverage extensive web exploration and refinement to obtain diverse task intents. The average cost is 28 cents per successful trajectory, making it affordable to a wide range of users in the community. Leveraging this dataset, we train Explorer, a multimodal web agent, and demonstrate strong performance on both offline and online web agent benchmarks such as Mind2Web-Live, Multimodal-Mind2Web, and MiniWob++. Additionally, our experiments highlight data scaling as a key driver for improving web agent capabilities.

Modeling hand-object interaction priors holds significant potential to advance robotic and embodied AI systems in learning to operate effectively within the physical world. We introduce SIGHT, a novel task focused on generating realistic and physically plausible 3D hand-object interaction trajectories from a single image and a brief language-based task description. Prior work on hand-object trajectory generation typically relies on textual input that lacks explicit grounding to the target object, or assumes access to 3D object meshes, which are often considerably more difficult to obtain than 2D images. We propose SIGHT-Fusion, a novel diffusion-based image-text conditioned generative model that tackles this task by retrieving the most similar 3D object mesh from a database and enforcing geometric hand-object interaction constraints via a novel inference-time diffusion guidance. We benchmark our model on the HOI4D and H2O datasets, adapting relevant baselines for this novel task.

Current approaches tokenize videos using space-time patches, leading to excessive tokens and computational inefficiencies. The best token reduction strategies degrade performance and barely reduce the number of tokens when the camera moves. We introduce grounded video tokenization, a paradigm that organizes tokens based on panoptic sub-object trajectories rather than fixed patches. Our method aligns with fundamental perceptual principles, ensuring that tokenization reflects scene complexity rather than video duration. We propose TrajViT, a video encoder that extracts object trajectories and converts them into semantically meaningful tokens, significantly reducing redundancy while maintaining temporal coherence. Trained with contrastive learning, TrajViT significantly outperforms space-time ViT (ViT3D) across multiple video understanding benchmarks, e.g., TrajViT outperforms ViT3D by a large margin of 6% top-5 recall in average at video-text retrieval task with 10x token deduction. We also show TrajViT as a stronger model than ViT3D for being the video encoder for modern VideoLLM, obtaining an average of 5.2% performance improvement across 6 VideoQA benchmarks while having 4x faster training time and 18x less inference FLOPs. TrajViT is the first efficient encoder to consistently outperform ViT3D across diverse video analysis tasks, making it a robust and scalable solution.</p></details> |  |

A significant limitation of existing frameworks is their reliance on invariant meta-actions assigned over fixed future time intervals, causing temporal misalignment with the actual behavior trajectories. This misalignment leads to irrelevant associations between the prescribed meta-actions and the resulting trajectories, disrupting task coherence and limiting model performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Autoregressive Meta-Actions, an approach integrated into autoregressive trajectory generation frameworks that provides a unified and precise definition for meta-action-conditioned trajectory prediction. Specifically, We decompose traditional long-interval meta-actions into frame-level meta-actions, enabling a sequential interplay between autoregressive meta-action prediction and meta-action-conditioned trajectory generation. This decomposition ensures strict alignment between each trajectory segment and its corresponding meta-action, achieving a consistent and unified task formulation across the entire trajectory span and significantly reducing complexity. Moreover, we propose a staged pre-training process to decouple the learning of basic motion dynamics from the integration of high-level decision control, which offers flexibility, stability, and modularity. Experimental results validate our framework's effectiveness, demonstrating improved trajectory adaptivity and responsiveness to dynamic decision-making scenarios.

To address this, we highlight the importance of timely calibration and the need to automatically construct calibration trajectories for training agents. We propose Step-Level Trajectory Calibration (STeCa), a novel framework for LLM agent learning. Specifically, STeCa identifies suboptimal actions through a step-level reward comparison during exploration. It constructs calibrated trajectories using LLM-driven reflection, enabling agents to learn from improved decision-making processes. We finally leverage these calibrated trajectories with successful trajectories for reinforced training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STeCa significantly outperforms existing methods.

In this paper, we introduce \textbf{TRACE (Trajectory-Constrained Attentional Concept Erasure)}, a novel method to erase targeted concepts from diffusion models while preserving overall generative quality. Our approach combines a rigorous theoretical framework, establishing formal conditions under which a concept can be provably suppressed in the diffusion process, with an effective fine-tuning procedure compatible with both conventional latent diffusion (Stable Diffusion) and emerging rectified flow models (e.g.~FLUX). We first derive a closed-form update to the model's cross-attention layers that removes hidden representations of the target concept. We then introduce a trajectory-aware finetuning objective that steers the denoising process away from the concept only in the late sampling stages, thus maintaining the model's fidelity on unrelated content. Empirically, we evaluate TRACE on multiple benchmarks used in prior concept erasure studies (object classes, celebrity faces, artistic styles, and explicit content from the I2P dataset). TRACE achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent methods such as ANT, EraseAnything, and MACE in terms of removal efficacy and output quality.</p></details> | In peer review |

There are several types of driving mechanisms for real-world applications, including two-wheeled, four-wheeled skid-steering, tracked robots, and so on. The differences in the driving mechanisms usually require specific kinematic modeling when precise control is desired. Furthermore, the nonholonomic dynamics and possible lateral slip lead to different degrees of difficulty in getting feasible and high-quality trajectories. Therefore, a comprehensive trajectory optimization framework to compute trajectories efficiently for various kinds of differential drive robots is highly desirable. In this paper, we propose a universal trajectory optimization framework that can be applied to differential drive robots, enabling the generation of high-quality trajectories within a restricted computational timeframe. We introduce a novel trajectory representation based on polynomial parameterization of motion states or their integrals, such as angular and linear velocities, which inherently matches the robots' motion to the control principle. The trajectory optimization problem is formulated to minimize complexity while prioritizing safety and operational efficiency. We then build a full-stack autonomous planning and control system to demonstrate its feasibility and robustness. We conduct extensive simulations and real-world testing in crowded environments with three kinds of differential drive robots to validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 15 pages, 16 figures |

In this paper, we leverage ideas from generative modeling of image data to push the boundary of time series generation. For this, we find new generators of SDEs and jump processes, inspired by trajectory flow matching, that have the marginal distributions of the time series of interest. Specifically, we can handle discontinuities of the underlying processes by parameterizing the jump kernel densities by scaled Gaussians that allow for closed form formulas of the corresponding Kullback-Leibler divergence in the loss. Unlike most other approaches, we are able to handle irregularly sampled time series.</p></details> |  |

While the lack of exact latent inversion is a core advantage of these methods, it often results in unstable editing trajectories and poor source consistency. To address this limitation, we propose FlowAlign, a novel inversion-free flow-based framework for consistent image editing with principled trajectory control. FlowAlign introduces a flow-matching loss as a regularization mechanism to promote smoother and more stable trajectories during the editing process. Notably, the flow-matching loss is shown to explicitly balance semantic alignment with the edit prompt and structural consistency with the source image along the trajectory. Furthermore, FlowAlign naturally supports reverse editing by simply reversing the ODE trajectory, highlighting the reversible and consistent nature of the transformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowAlign outperforms existing methods in both source preservation and editing controllability.</p></details> |  |

Existing imputation methods rely on sparse trajectory or travel information, such as velocity, to infer missing points. However, these approaches assume that sparse trajectories retain essential behavioral patterns, which place significant demands on data acquisition and overlook the potential of large-scale human trajectory embeddings. To address this, we propose ProDiff, a trajectory imputation framework that uses only two endpoints as minimal information. It integrates prototype learning to embed human movement patterns and a denoising diffusion probabilistic model for robust spatiotemporal reconstruction. Joint training with a tailored loss function ensures effective imputation. ProDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving accuracy by 6.28\% on FourSquare and 2.52\% on WuXi. Further analysis shows a 0.927 correlation between generated and real trajectories, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Traditional MPI reconstruction relies on either time-consuming calibration (measured system matrix) or model-based simulation of the forward operator. Recent developments have shown the applicability of Chebyshev polynomials to multi-dimensional Lissajous Field-Free Point (FFP) scans. This method is bound to the particular choice of sinusoidal scanning trajectories. In this paper, we present the first reconstruction on real 2D MPI data with a trajectory-independent model-based MPI reconstruction algorithm. We further develop the zero-shot Plug-and-Play (PnP) algorithm of the authors -- with automatic noise level estimation -- to address the present deconvolution problem, leveraging a state-of-the-art denoiser trained on natural images without retraining on MPI-specific data. We evaluate our method on the publicly available 2D FFP MPI dataset ``MPIdata: Equilibrium Model with Anisotropy", featuring scans of six phantoms acquired using a Bruker preclinical scanner. Moreover, we show reconstruction performed on custom data on a 2D scanner with additional high-frequency excitation field and partial data. Our results demonstrate strong reconstruction capabilities across different scanning scenarios -- setting a precedent for general-purpose, flexible model-based MPI reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

We find that, across languages and contexts, the ratio of instantaneous displacement to instantaneous velocity generally follows an exponential decay curve from movement onset to movement offset. We formalize this empirical discovery in a differential equation and, in combination with an assumption of point attractor dynamics, derive a nonlinear second-order dynamical system describing labial constriction trajectories. The equation has only two parameters, T and r. T corresponds to the target state and r corresponds to movement rapidity. Thus, each of the parameters corresponds to a phonetically relevant dimension of control. Nonlinear regression demonstrates that the model provides excellent fits to individual movement trajectories. Moreover, trajectories simulated from the model qualitatively match empirical trajectories, and capture key kinematic variables like duration, peak velocity, and time to achieve peak velocity. The model constitutes a proposal for the dynamics of individual articulatory movements, and thus offers a novel foundation from which to understand additional influences on articulatory kinematics like prosody, inter-movement coordination, and stochastic noise.</p></details> |  |

Synthetic data exhibit similar characteristics to Ohman's sequences, including the presence of S-shaped F2 trajectories. Furthermore, locus equations (LEs) for F2 and F3 are computed from synthetic CV data to investigate their underlying determinism, leading to a reassessment of conventional interpretations. The findings indicate that, although articulatory planning is structured separately for vowel and consonant groups, S-shaped F2 trajectories emerge from a composite mechanism governed by the coordinated synergy of all articulators.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, submitted to Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

This study categorizes such misalignments into three types: (1) lack of functions to express intent, (2) inefficient action sequences, and (3) incorrect intentions that cannot solve the task. To address these issues, we first formalize and define these three misalignment types in a unified framework. We then propose a heuristic algorithm to detect misalignments in ARCTraj trajectories and analyze their impact hierarchically and quantitatively. We also present an intention estimation method based on our formalism that infers missing alignment between user actions and intentions. Through trajectory alignment, we experimentally demonstrate that AI models trained on human task-solving trajectories improve performance in mimicking human reasoning. Based on hierarchical analysis and experiments, we highlight the importance of trajectory-intention alignment and demonstrate the effectiveness of intention-aligned training.</p></details> | KDD 2025 accepted |

Although the overall performance accuracy of trajectory prediction is relatively high, the lack of trajectory data in critical scenarios in the training data leads to the long-tail phenomenon. Normally, the trajectories of the tail data are more critical and more difficult to predict and may include rare scenarios such as crashes. To solve this problem, we extracted the trajectory data from real-world crash scenarios, which contain more long-tail data. Meanwhile, based on the trajectory data in this scenario, we integrated graph-based risk information and diffusion with transformer and proposed the Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer (RI-DiT) trajectory prediction method. Extensive experiments were conducted on trajectory data in the real-world crash scenario, and the results show that the algorithm we proposed has good performance. When predicting the data of the tail 10\% (Top 10\%), the minADE and minFDE indicators are 0.016/2.667 m. At the same time, we showed the trajectory conditions of different long-tail distributions. The distribution of trajectory data is closer to the tail, the less smooth the trajectory is. Through the trajectory data in real-world crash scenarios, Our work expands the methods to overcome the long-tail challenges in trajectory prediction. Our method, RI-DiT, integrates inverse time to collision (ITTC) and the feature of traffic flow, which can predict long-tail trajectories more accurately and improve the safety of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |

However, previous LLM-based methods, which are superficially adapted to next POI prediction, largely overlook critical challenges associated with applying LLMs to this task. Specifically, LLMs encounter two critical challenges: (1) a lack of intrinsic understanding of numeric spatiotemporal data, which hinders accurate modeling of users' spatiotemporal distributions and preferences; and (2) an excessively large and unconstrained candidate POI space, which often results in random or irrelevant predictions. To address these issues, we propose a Collaborative Multi Agent Framework for Next POI Prediction, named CoMaPOI. Through the close interaction of three specialized agents (Profiler, Forecaster, and Predictor), CoMaPOI collaboratively addresses the two critical challenges. The Profiler agent is responsible for converting numeric data into language descriptions, enhancing semantic understanding. The Forecaster agent focuses on dynamically constraining and refining the candidate POI space. The Predictor agent integrates this information to generate high-precision predictions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (NYC, TKY, and CA) demonstrate that CoMaPOI achieves state of the art performance, improving all metrics by 5% to 10% compared to SOTA baselines. This work pioneers the investigation of challenges associated with applying LLMs to complex spatiotemporal tasks by leveraging tailored collaborative agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by SIGIR 2025</p></details> |

Key contributions include the quantum-based state transitions, return calculation, and trajectory search mechanism that utilize quantum principles to demonstrate the realization of RL processes through quantum phenomena. The implementation emphasizes the fundamental role of quantum superposition in enhancing computational efficiency for RL tasks. Results demonstrate the capacity of a quantum model to achieve quantum enhancement in RL, highlighting the potential of fully quantum implementations in decision-making tasks.

Currently, large generalized policies are trained to predict controls or trajectories using diffusion models, which have the desirable property of learning multimodal action distributions. However, generalizability comes with a cost, namely, larger model size and slower inference. This is especially an issue for robotic tasks that require high control frequency. Further, there is a known trade-off between performance and action horizon for Diffusion Policy (DP), a popular model for generating trajectories: fewer diffusion queries accumulate greater trajectory tracking errors. For these reasons, it is common practice to run these models at high inference frequency, subject to robot computational constraints. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Weight Diffusion (LWD), a method that uses diffusion to generate closed-loop policies (weights for neural policies) for robotic tasks, rather than generating trajectories. Learning the behavior distribution through parameter space over trajectory space offers two key advantages: longer action horizons (fewer diffusion queries) & robustness to perturbations while retaining high performance; and a lower inference compute cost. To this end, we show that LWD has higher success rates than DP when the action horizon is longer and when stochastic perturbations exist in the environment. Furthermore, LWD achieves multitask performance comparable to DP while requiring just ~1/45th of the inference-time FLOPS</p></details> |  |

However, they are computationally expensive because they sample a trajectory of trajectories: a diffusion$/$flow trajectory of action trajectories. They discard intermediate action trajectories, and must wait for the sampling process to complete before any actions can be executed on the robot. We simplify diffusion$/$flow policies by treating action trajectories as flow trajectories. Instead of starting from pure noise, our algorithm samples from a narrow Gaussian around the last action. Then, it incrementally integrates a velocity field learned via flow matching to produce a sequence of actions that constitute a single trajectory. This enables actions to be streamed to the robot on-the-fly during the flow sampling process, and is well-suited for receding horizon policy execution. Despite streaming, our method retains the ability to model multi-modal behavior. We train flows that stabilize around demonstration trajectories to reduce distribution shift and improve imitation learning performance. Streaming flow policy outperforms prior methods while enabling faster policy execution and tighter sensorimotor loops for learning-based robot control.

However, existing learning-based planning methods often rely on expert demonstrations, which not only lack explicit safety awareness but also risk inheriting unsafe behaviors such as speeding from suboptimal human driving data. Inspired by the success of large language models, we propose Plan-R1, a novel two-stage trajectory planning framework that formulates trajectory planning as a sequential prediction task, guided by explicit planning principles such as safety, comfort, and traffic rule compliance. In the first stage, we train an autoregressive trajectory predictor via next motion token prediction on expert data. In the second stage, we design rule-based rewards (e.g., collision avoidance, speed limits) and fine-tune the model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning strategy, to align its predictions with these planning principles. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that our Plan-R1 significantly improves planning safety and feasibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be made public soon.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose IKMo, an image-keyframed motion generation method based on the diffusion model with trajectory and pose being decoupled. The trajectory and pose inputs go through a two-stage conditioning framework. In the first stage, the dedicated optimization module is applied to refine inputs. In the second stage, trajectory and pose are encoded via a Trajectory Encoder and a Pose Encoder in parallel. Then, motion with high spatial and semantic fidelity is guided by a motion ControlNet, which processes the fused trajectory and pose data. Experiment results based on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art on all metrics under trajectory-keyframe constraints. In addition, MLLM-based agents are implemented to pre-process model inputs. Given texts and keyframe images from users, the agents extract motion descriptions, keyframe poses, and trajectories as the optimized inputs into the motion generation model. We conducts a user study with 10 participants. The experiment results prove that the MLLM-based agents pre-processing makes generated motion more in line with users' expectation. We believe that the proposed method improves both the fidelity and controllability of motion generation by the diffusion model.</p></details> |  |

However, as nearly passive reflective metasurfaces, RISs may not distinguish between desired and interference signals, which can lead to severe spectrum pollution and even affect performance negatively. In particular, in large-scale networks, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the receiving node can be degraded due to excessive interference reflected from the RIS. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we propose in this paper a trajectory prediction-based dynamical control algorithm (TPC) for anticipating RIS ON-OFF states sequence, integrating a long-short-term-memory (LSTM) scheme to predict user trajectories. In particular, through a codebook-based algorithm, the RIS controller adaptively coordinates the configuration of the RIS elements to maximize the received SINR. Our simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed TPC method over various system settings.</p></details> |  |

Existing OPE methods are ineffective for high-dimensional, long-horizon problems, due to exponential blow-ups in variance from importance weighting or compounding errors from learned dynamics models. To address these challenges, we propose STITCH-OPE, a model-based generative framework that leverages denoising diffusion for long-horizon OPE in high-dimensional state and action spaces. Starting with a diffusion model pre-trained on the behavior data, STITCH-OPE generates synthetic trajectories from the target policy by guiding the denoising process using the score function of the target policy. STITCH-OPE proposes two technical innovations that make it advantageous for OPE: (1) prevents over-regularization by subtracting the score of the behavior policy during guidance, and (2) generates long-horizon trajectories by stitching partial trajectories together end-to-end. We provide a theoretical guarantee that under mild assumptions, these modifications result in an exponential reduction in variance versus long-horizon trajectory diffusion. Experiments on the D4RL and OpenAI Gym benchmarks show substantial improvement in mean squared error, correlation, and regret metrics compared to state-of-the-art OPE methods.</p></details> |  |

In practice, agents sensitive to the outcome of certain key steps which makes them likely to fail the task because of a subtle mistake in the planning trajectory. Recent approaches resort to calibrating the reasoning process through reinforcement learning. They reward or penalize every reasoning step with process supervision, as known as Process Reward Models (PRMs). However, PRMs are difficult and costly to scale up with a large number of next action candidates since they require extensive computations to acquire the training data through the per-step trajectory exploration. To mitigate this issue, we focus on the relative reward trend across successive reasoning steps and propose maintaining an increasing reward in the collected trajectories for process supervision, which we term Reward Rising Optimization (RRO). Specifically, we incrementally augment the process supervision until identifying a step exhibiting positive reward differentials, i.e. rising rewards, relative to its preceding iteration. This method dynamically expands the search space for the next action candidates, efficiently capturing high-quality data. We provide mathematical groundings and empirical results on the WebShop and InterCode-SQL benchmarks, showing that our proposed RRO achieves superior performance while requiring much less exploration cost.</p></details> | preprint |

In this study, we introduce HiT (Human-like Trajectory Prediction), a novel model designed to enhance trajectory prediction by incorporating behavior-aware modules and dynamic centrality measures. Unlike traditional methods that primarily rely on static graph structures, HiT leverages a dynamic framework that accounts for both direct and indirect interactions among traffic participants. This allows the model to capture the subtle yet significant influences of surrounding vehicles, enabling more accurate and human-like predictions. To evaluate HiT's performance, we conducted extensive experiments using diverse and challenging real-world datasets, including NGSIM, HighD, RounD, ApolloScape, and MoCAD++. The results demonstrate that HiT consistently outperforms other top models across multiple metrics, particularly excelling in scenarios involving aggressive driving behaviors.

Instead of producing an unordered set of views independently or simultaneously, we generate a sequence of views, leveraging temporal consistency to enhance 3D coherence. More importantly, our view sequence is not determined by a pre-determined and fixed camera setup. Instead, we compute an adaptive camera trajectory (ACT), forming an orbit, which seeks to maximize the visibility of occluded regions of the 3D object to be reconstructed. Once the best orbit is found, we feed it to a video diffusion model to generate novel views around the orbit, which can then be passed to any multi-view 3D reconstruction model to obtain the final result. Our multi-view synthesis pipeline is quite efficient since it involves no run-time training/optimization, only forward inferences by applying pre-trained models for occlusion analysis and multi-view synthesis. Our method predicts camera trajectories that reveal occlusions effectively and produce consistent novel views, significantly improving 3D reconstruction over SOTA alternatives on the unseen GSO dataset.</p></details> |  |

In the one-shot setting, the agent generates a policy after observing a single expert demonstration without additional fine-tuning. Existing approaches typically train and evaluate on the same set of tasks, varying only object configurations, and struggle to generalize to unseen tasks with different semantic or structural requirements. While some recent methods attempt to address this, they exhibit low success rates on hard test tasks that, despite being visually similar to some training tasks, differ in context and require distinct responses. Additionally, most existing methods lack an explicit model of environment dynamics, limiting their ability to reason about future states. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for one-shot visual imitation learning via world-model-guided trajectory generation. Given an expert demonstration video and the agent's initial observation, our method leverages a learned world model to predict a sequence of latent states and actions. This latent trajectory is then decoded into physical waypoints that guide the agent's execution. Our method is evaluated on two simulated benchmarks and three real-world robotic platforms, where it consistently outperforms prior approaches, with over 30% improvement in some cases.</p></details> |  |

However, current powerful agents often depend on sophisticated prompt engineering combined with closed-source LLMs like GPT-4. Although training open-source LLMs using expert trajectories from teacher models has yielded some improvements in agent capabilities, this approach still faces limitations such as performance plateauing and error propagation. To mitigate these challenges, we propose STeP, a novel method for improving LLM-based agent training. We synthesize self-reflected trajectories that include reflections and corrections of error steps, which enhance the effectiveness of LLM agents in learning from teacher models, enabling them to become agents capable of self-reflecting and correcting. We also introduce partial masking strategy that prevents the LLM from internalizing incorrect or suboptimal steps.

By conceptualizing reasoning trajectories as pseudo-gradient descent updates to the LLM's parameters, we identify parallels between LLM reasoning and various meta-learning paradigms. We formalize the training process for reasoning tasks as a meta-learning setup, with each question treated as an individual task, and reasoning trajectories serving as the inner loop optimization for adapting model parameters. Once trained on a diverse set of questions, the LLM develops fundamental reasoning capabilities that can generalize to previously unseen questions. Extensive empirical evaluations substantiate the strong connection between LLM reasoning and meta-learning, exploring several issues of significant interest from a meta-learning standpoint. Our work not only enhances the understanding of LLM reasoning but also provides practical insights for improving these models through established meta-learning techniques.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we explore their potential and introduce the surprising result that naively applying standards MDMs severely degrades the performance. We identify the critical cause of this issue as a state-clashing problem-where the forward diffusion of distinct molecules collapse into a common state, resulting in a mixture of reconstruction targets that cannot be learned using typical reverse diffusion process with unimodal predictions. To mitigate this, we propose Masked Element-wise Learnable Diffusion (MELD) that orchestrates per-element corruption trajectories to avoid collision between distinct molecular graphs. This is achieved through a parameterized noise scheduling network that assigns distinct corruption rates to individual graph elements, i.e., atoms and bonds. Extensive experiments on diverse molecular benchmarks reveal that MELD markedly enhances overall generation quality compared to element-agnostic noise scheduling, increasing the chemical validity of vanilla MDMs on ZINC250K from 15% to 93%, Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art property alignment in conditional generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches face critical limitations that lack high-quality training trajectories or suffer from the distributional mismatches in simulated environments and prohibitive computational costs for real-world deployment. This paper introduces SimpleDeepSearcher, a lightweight yet effective framework that bridges this gap through strategic data engineering rather than complex training paradigms. Our approach synthesizes high-quality training data by simulating realistic user interactions in live web search environments, coupled with a multi-criteria curation strategy that optimizes the diversity and quality of input and output side. Experiments on five benchmarks across diverse domains demonstrate that SFT on only 871 curated samples yields significant improvements over RL-based baselines. Our work establishes SFT as a viable pathway by systematically addressing the data-scarce bottleneck, offering practical insights for efficient deep search systems.

This absence of self-supervision allows early prediction errors to compound catastrophically over time. We introduce Echo Planning, a novel self-correcting framework that establishes a closed-loop Current - Future - Current (CFC) cycle to harmonize trajectory prediction with scene coherence. Our key insight is that plausible future trajectories must be bi-directionally consistent, ie, not only generated from current observations but also capable of reconstructing them. The CFC mechanism first predicts future trajectories from the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) scene representation, then inversely maps these trajectories back to estimate the current BEV state. By enforcing consistency between the original and reconstructed BEV representations through a cycle loss, the framework intrinsically penalizes physically implausible or misaligned trajectories. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, reducing L2 error by 0.04 m and collision rate by 0.12% compared to one-shot planners. Crucially, our method requires no additional supervision, leveraging the CFC cycle as an inductive bias for robust planning. This work offers a deployable solution for safety-critical autonomous systems.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Test-Time Scaling of Diffusion Models via Noise Trajectory Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03164v1)** | 2025-05-24 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2506.03164v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The iterative and stochastic nature of diffusion models enables test-time scaling, whereby spending additional compute during denoising generates higher-fidelity samples. Increasing the number of denoising steps is the primary scaling axis, but this yields quickly diminishing returns. Instead optimizing the noise trajectory--the sequence of injected noise vectors--is promising, as the specific noise realizations critically affect sample quality; but this is challenging due to a high-dimensional search space, complex noise-outcome interactions, and costly trajectory evaluations. We address this by first casting diffusion as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a terminal reward, showing tree-search methods such as Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to be meaningful but impractical. To balance performance and efficiency, we then resort to a relaxation of MDP, where we view denoising as a sequence of independent contextual bandits. This allows us to introduce an $\epsilon$-greedy search algorithm that globally explores at extreme timesteps and locally exploits during the intermediate steps where de-mixing occurs. Experiments on EDM and Stable Diffusion reveal state-of-the-art scores for class-conditioned/text-to-image generation, exceeding baselines by up to $164\%$ and matching/exceeding MCTS performance. To our knowledge, this is the first practical method for test-time noise trajectory optimization of arbitrary (non-differentiable) rewards.</p></details> |  |

Machine learning has become an invaluable tool for scaling physics-based simulators and developing models directly from experimental data. In particular, recent advances based on deep generative modeling and geometric deep learning have enabled probabilistic simulation by modeling complex distributions over trajectories while respecting the permutation symmetry that is fundamental to N-body systems. However, to generate realistic trajectories, existing methods must learn complex transformations starting from uninformed noise and do not allow for the exploitation of domain-informed priors. In this work, we propose STFlow to address this limitation. By leveraging flow matching and data-dependent couplings, STFlow facilitates physics-informed simulation of geometric trajectories without sacrificing model expressivity or scalability. Our evaluation on N-body dynamical systems, molecular dynamics, and pedestrian dynamics benchmarks shows that STFlow produces significantly lower prediction errors while enabling more efficient inference, highlighting the benefits of employing physics-informed prior distributions in probabilistic geometric trajectory modeling.</p></details> | 20 pages, 17 figures |

The lack of analytical expression for the trailer's errors to the center line pose a great challenge to the trajectory planning for tractor-trailer vehicles. To address this issue, we first use geometric representations to characterize the lateral and orientation errors in Cartesian frame, where the errors would serve as the components of the cost function and the road edge constraints within our optimization process. Next, we generate a coarse trajectory to warm-start the subsequent optimization problems. On the other hand, to achieve a good approximation of the continuous-time kinematics, optimization-based methods usually discretize the kinematics with a large sampling number. This leads to an increase in the number of the variables and constraints, thus making the optimization problem difficult to solve. To address this issue, we design a Progressively Increasing Sampling Number Optimization (PISNO) framework. More specifically, we first find a nearly feasible trajectory with a small sampling number to warm-start the optimization process. Then, the sampling number is progressively increased, and the corresponding intermediate Optimal Control Problem (OCP) is solved in each iteration. Next, we further resample the obtained solution into a finer sampling period, and then use it to warm-start the intermediate OCP in next iteration. This process is repeated until reaching a threshold sampling number. Simulation and experiment results show the proposed method exhibits a good performance and less computational consumption over the benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

While stitching is historically a strength of offline reinforcement learning, recent generative behavioural cloning (BC) methods have also shown proficiency at stitching. However, the main factors behind this are poorly understood, hindering the development of new algorithms that can reliably stitch. Focusing on diffusion planners trained via BC, we find two properties are needed to compose: \emph{positional equivariance} and \emph{local receptiveness}. We use these two properties to explain architecture, data, and inference choices in existing generative BC methods based on diffusion planning, including replanning frequency, data augmentation, and data scaling. Experimental comparisions show that (1) while locality is more important than positional equivariance in creating a diffusion planner capable of composition, both are crucial (2) enabling these properties through relatively simple architecture choices can be competitive with more computationally expensive methods such as replanning or scaling data, and (3) simple inpainting-based guidance can guide architecturally compositional models to enable generalization in goal-conditioned settings.</p></details> | 9 Pages |

At the upper tier, a lightweight behavior-cloning network consumes six-axis force/torque streams from dual wrist-mounted sensors and outputs whole-body planar velocity commands that capture the leader's applied forces. At the lower tier, a deep-reinforcement-learning policy, trained under randomized payloads (0-3 kg) and friction conditions in Isaac Gym and validated in MuJoCo and on a real Unitree G1, maps these high-level twists to stable, under-load joint trajectories. By decoupling intent interpretation (force -> velocity) from legged locomotion (velocity -> joints), our method combines intuitive responsiveness to human inputs with robust, load-adaptive walking. We collect training data without motion-capture or markers, only synchronized RGB video and F/T readings, employing SAM2 and WHAM to extract 3D human pose and velocity. In real-world trials, our humanoid achieves cooperative carry-and-move performance (completion time, trajectory deviation, velocity synchrony, and follower-force) on par with a blindfolded human-follower baseline. This work is the first to demonstrate learned haptic guidance fused with full-body legged control for fluid human-humanoid co-manipulation.

However, existing methods for trajectory retrieval face notable limitations, including inefficiencies in large-scale data, lack of support for condition-based queries, and reliance on trajectory similarity measures. To address the above challenges, we propose OmniTraj, a generalized and flexible omni-semantic trajectory retrieval framework that integrates four complementary modalities or semantics -- raw trajectories, topology, road segments, and regions -- into a unified system. Unlike traditional approaches that are limited to computing and processing trajectories as a single modality, OmniTraj designs dedicated encoders for each modality, which are embedded and fused into a shared representation space. This design enables OmniTraj to support accurate and flexible queries based on any individual modality or combination thereof, overcoming the rigidity of traditional similarity-based methods. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of OmniTraj in handling large-scale data, providing flexible, multi-modality queries, and supporting downstream tasks and applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a full paper by KDD'25 - Research Track</p></details> |

Power and energy bounds are intuitive metrics to describe the flexibility of energy-constrained loads. However, to be used in operation, any power consumption trajectory fulfilling the power and energy bounds must necessarily fulfill the load's constraints. In this paper, we demonstrate that energy bounds defined as the minimum and maximum energy consumption potential of a load with state-dependent losses are Trajectory-Dependent (TD), i.e., for any energy value in the bounds a feasible power trajectory exists, but not all power trajectories enclosed in the energy envelopes satisfy the load's constraints. To guarantee the satisfaction of load constraints for all trajectories, we define Trajectory-Independent (TI) energy bounds. We present TI envelope formulations for individual loads, as well as physically coupled loads and assess the proposed formulations in a building heating system, a system with state-dependent losses. We find that using a TD envelope as energy bounds in operation may yield room temperature up to 3.8{\deg}C higher and 3.4{\deg}C lower than admissible. Overall, poorly insulated buildings observe a TI energy envelope that differs significantly from their TD envelope.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Current dataset distillation techniques, particularly Trajectory Matching methods, optimize synthetic data so that the model's training trajectory on synthetic samples mirrors that on real data. While demonstrating efficacy on medium-scale synthetic datasets, these methods fail to adequately preserve semantic richness under extreme sample scarcity. To address this limitation, we propose a novel dataset distillation method integrating contrastive learning during image synthesis. By explicitly maximizing instance-level feature discrimination, our approach produces more informative and diverse synthetic samples, even when dataset sizes are significantly constrained. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating contrastive learning substantially enhances the performance of models trained on very small-scale synthetic datasets. This integration not only guides more effective feature representation but also significantly improves the visual fidelity of the synthesized images. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves notable performance improvements over existing distillation techniques, especially in scenarios with extremely limited synthetic data.</p></details> | Under review |

These methods train a student model to approximate the multi-step denoising process of a pretrained teacher model in a single step, enabling one-shot generation. However, theoretical insights into the trade-off between different distillation strategies and generative quality remain limited, complicating their optimization and selection. In this work, we take a first step toward addressing this gap. Specifically, we reinterpret trajectory distillation as an operator merging problem in the linear regime, where each step of the teacher model is represented as a linear operator acting on noisy data. These operators admit a clear geometric interpretation as projections and rescalings corresponding to the noise schedule. During merging, signal shrinkage occurs as a convex combination of operators, arising from both discretization and limited optimization time of the student model. We propose a dynamic programming algorithm to compute the optimal merging strategy that maximally preserves signal fidelity. Additionally, we demonstrate the existence of a sharp phase transition in the optimal strategy, governed by data covariance structures. Our findings enhance the theoretical understanding of diffusion trajectory distillation and offer practical insights for improving distillation strategies.</p></details> | 31 pages, 19 figures |

To address these issues, we propose SwarmDiff, a hierarchical and scalable generative framework for swarm robots. We model the swarm's macroscopic state using Probability Density Functions (PDFs) and leverage conditional diffusion models to generate risk-aware macroscopic trajectory distributions, which then guide the generation of individual robot trajectories at the microscopic level. To ensure a balance between the swarm's optimal transportation and risk awareness, we integrate Wasserstein metrics and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). Additionally, we introduce a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to improve sampling efficiency and generation quality by capturing long-range dependencies. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that SwarmDiff outperforms existing methods in computational efficiency, trajectory validity, and scalability, making it a reliable solution for swarm robotic trajectory planning.</p></details> |  |

However, the insights gained from the iterative learning procedure typically remain underutilized in multi-objective hyperparameter optimization scenarios. Despite the limited research in this area, existing methods commonly identify the trade-offs only at the end of model training, overlooking the fact that trade-offs can emerge at earlier epochs in cases such as overfitting. To bridge this gap, we propose an enhanced multi-objective hyperparameter optimization problem that treats the number of training epochs as a decision variable, rather than merely an auxiliary parameter, to account for trade-offs at an earlier training stage. To solve this problem and accommodate its iterative learning, we then present a trajectory-based multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithm characterized by two features: 1) a novel acquisition function that captures the improvement along the predictive trajectory of model performances over epochs for any hyperparameter setting and 2) a multi-objective early stopping mechanism that determines when to terminate the training to maximize epoch efficiency. Experiments on synthetic simulations and hyperparameter tuning benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm can effectively identify the desirable trade-offs while improving tuning efficiency.</p></details> |  |

When system dynamics change unexpectedly, performance degrades until models are retrained on new data. We introduce Reflexive World Models (RWM), a dual control framework that uses world model predictions as implicit reference trajectories for rapid adaptation. Our method separates the control problem into long-term reward maximization through reinforcement learning and robust motor execution through rapid latent control. This dual architecture achieves significantly faster adaptation with low online computational cost compared to model-based RL baselines, while maintaining near-optimal performance. The approach combines the benefits of flexible policy learning through reinforcement learning with rapid error correction capabilities, providing a principled approach to maintaining performance in high-dimensional continuous control tasks under varying dynamics.</p></details> |  |

Our methodology estimates observation noise and prior distributions over model parameters from several large-scale datasets. Incorporating these priors can then regularize prediction models. Our results show that linear models do represent real-world trajectories with high fidelity at very moderate model complexity.

We revisit the classical paradigm of Bellman Residual Minimization and introduce Trajectory Bellman Residual Minimization (TBRM), an algorithm that naturally adapts this idea to LLMs, yielding a simple yet effective off-policy algorithm that optimizes a single trajectory-level Bellman objective using the model's own logits as $Q$-values. TBRM removes the need for critics, importance-sampling ratios, or clipping, and operates with only one rollout per prompt. We prove convergence to the near-optimal KL-regularized policy from arbitrary off-policy data via an improved change-of-trajectory-measure analysis. Experiments on standard mathematical-reasoning benchmarks show that TBRM consistently outperforms policy-based baselines, like PPO and GRPO, with comparable or lower computational and memory overhead. Our results indicate that value-based RL might be a principled and efficient alternative for enhancing reasoning capabilities in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a trajectory planning method for intelligent vehicles based on the risk reachable set to further improve the safety of trajectory planning. First, we construct the reachable set incorporating the driving risk field to more accurately assess and avoid potential risks in drivable areas. Then, the initial trajectory is generated based on safe reinforcement learning and projected onto the reachable set. Finally, we introduce a trajectory planning method based on a constrained iterative quadratic regulator to optimize the initial solution, ensuring that the planned trajectory achieves optimal comfort, safety, and efficiency. We conduct simulation tests of trajectory planning in high-speed lane-changing scenarios. The results indicate that the proposed method can guarantee trajectory comfort and driving efficiency, with the generated trajectory situated outside high-risk boundaries, thereby ensuring vehicle safety during operation.</p></details> | <details><summary>We si...</summary><p>We sincerely request the withdrawal of this paper.

This sparse characteristic presents challenges for their direct use in GPS-based systems. This paper addresses the task of map-constrained trajectory recovery, aiming to enhance trajectory sampling rates of GPS trajectories. Previous studies commonly adopt a sequence-to-sequence framework, where an encoder captures the trajectory patterns and a decoder reconstructs the target trajectory. Within this framework, effectively representing the road network and extracting relevant trajectory features are crucial for overall performance. Despite advancements in these models, they fail to fully leverage the complex spatio-temporal dynamics present in both the trajectory and the road network. To overcome these limitations, we categorize the spatio-temporal dynamics of trajectory data into two distinct aspects: spatial-temporal traffic dynamics and trajectory dynamics. Furthermore, We propose TedTrajRec, a novel method for trajectory recovery. To capture spatio-temporal traffic dynamics, we introduce PD-GNN, which models periodic patterns and learns topologically aware dynamics concurrently for each road segment. For spatio-temporal trajectory dynamics, we present TedFormer, a time-aware Transformer that incorporates temporal dynamics for each GPS location by integrating closed-form neural ordinary differential equations into the attention mechanism. This allows TedFormer to effectively handle irregularly sampled data. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of TedTrajRec.

While hypernetworks work well, training them is cumbersome, and often requires ground truth optimized weights for each sample. However, obtaining each of these weights is a training problem of its own-one needs to train, e.g., adaptation weights or even an entire neural field for hypernetworks to regress to. In this work, we propose a method to train hypernetworks, without the need for any per-sample ground truth. Our key idea is to learn a Hypernetwork `Field` and estimate the entire trajectory of network weight training instead of simply its converged state. In other words, we introduce an additional input to the Hypernetwork, the convergence state, which then makes it act as a neural field that models the entire convergence pathway of a task network. A critical benefit in doing so is that the gradient of the estimated weights at any convergence state must then match the gradients of the original task -- this constraint alone is sufficient to train the Hypernetwork Field. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through the task of personalized image generation and 3D shape reconstruction from images and point clouds, demonstrating competitive results without any per-sample ground truth.</p></details> |  |

We first extract dense optical flow from a reference video, and utilize the resulting motion offsets to warp the complex-exponential tensors of RoPE, effectively encoding motion into the generation process. These embeddings are then further optimized during denoising time steps via trajectory alignment between the predicted and target velocities using a flow-matching objective. To keep the output faithful to the text prompt and prevent duplicate generations, we incorporate a regularization term based on the phase components of the reference video's Fourier transform, projecting the phase angles onto a smooth manifold to suppress high-frequency artifacts. Experiments on benchmarks reveal that RoPECraft outperforms all recently published methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://berkegokmen1.github.io/RoPECraft/</p></details> |

DreamGen leverages state-of-the-art image-to-video generative models, adapting them to the target robot embodiment to produce photorealistic synthetic videos of familiar or novel tasks in diverse environments. Since these models generate only videos, we recover pseudo-action sequences using either a latent action model or an inverse-dynamics model (IDM). Despite its simplicity, DreamGen unlocks strong behavior and environment generalization: a humanoid robot can perform 22 new behaviors in both seen and unseen environments, while requiring teleoperation data from only a single pick-and-place task in one environment. To evaluate the pipeline systematically, we introduce DreamGen Bench, a video generation benchmark that shows a strong correlation between benchmark performance and downstream policy success. Our work establishes a promising new axis for scaling robot learning well beyond manual data collection.</p></details> | <details><summary>See w...</summary><p>See website for videos: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/gear/dreamgen</p></details> |

A desirable trajectory learning model should be able to transfer across regions and tasks without retraining, avoiding the need to maintain multiple specialized models and subpar performance with limited training data. However, each region has its unique spatial features and contexts, which are reflected in vehicle movement patterns and difficult to generalize. Additionally, transferring across different tasks faces technical challenges due to the varying input-output structures required for each task. Existing efforts towards transferability primarily involve learning embedding vectors for trajectories, which perform poorly in region transfer and require retraining of prediction modules for task transfer. To address these challenges, we propose TransferTraj, a vehicle GPS trajectory learning model that excels in both region and task transferability. For region transferability, we introduce RTTE as the main learnable module within TransferTraj. It integrates spatial, temporal, POI, and road network modalities of trajectories to effectively manage variations in spatial context distribution across regions. It also introduces a TRIE module for incorporating relative information of spatial features and a spatial context MoE module for handling movement patterns in diverse contexts. For task transferability, we propose a task-transferable input-output scheme that unifies the input-output structure of different tasks into the masking and recovery of modalities and trajectory points. This approach allows TransferTraj to be pre-trained once and transferred to different tasks without retraining. Extensive experiments on three real-world vehicle trajectory datasets under task transfer, zero-shot, and few-shot region transfer, validating TransferTraj's effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

The proposed planner integrates real-time trajectory optimization with adaptive gap analysis, enabling effective feasibility assessment under partial observability constraints. To address safety-critical computations in unknown scenarios, an enhanced online learning mechanism is introduced, which dynamically corrects spatial trajectories by forming dynamic safety margins while maintaining control invariance. Extensive evaluations, including ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms, demonstrate superior success rates and computational efficiency. The framework's effectiveness is further validated on both simulated and physical robotic platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Synthetic Human Trajectories: Imitative Generation and Benchmarks Beyond Datasaurus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13790v2)** | 2025-05-19 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2409.13790v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trajectory data, which plays a crucial role in various applications such as crowd management and epidemic prevention, is challenging to obtain due to practical constraints and privacy concerns. In this context, synthetic human trajectory data is generated to simulate as close as possible to real-world human trajectories, often under summary statistics and distributional similarities. However, these similarities oversimplify complex human mobility patterns (a.k.a. ``Datasaurus''), resulting in intrinsic biases in both generative model design and benchmarks of the generated trajectories. Against this background, we propose MIRAGE, a huMan-Imitative tRAjectory GenErative model designed as a neural Temporal Point Process integrating an Exploration and Preferential Return model. It imitates the human decision-making process in trajectory generation, rather than fitting any specific statistical distributions as traditional methods do, thus avoiding the Datasaurus issue. We also propose a comprehensive task-based evaluation protocol beyond Datasaurus to systematically benchmark trajectory generative models on four typical downstream tasks, integrating multiple techniques and evaluation metrics for each task, to assess the ultimate utility of the generated trajectories. We conduct a thorough evaluation of MIRAGE on three real-world user trajectory datasets against a sizeable collection of baselines. Results show that compared to the best baselines, MIRAGE-generated trajectory data not only achieves the best statistical and distributional similarities with 59.0-67.7% improvement, but also yields the best performance in the task-based evaluation with 10.9-33.4% improvement. A series of ablation studies also validate the key design choices of MIRAGE.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD'25 |

However, progress in this field is hindered by two key challenges: the over-reliance on older datasets from 2012-2013 and the lack of reproducible, city-level check-in datasets that reflect diverse global regions. To address these gaps, we present Massive-STEPS (Massive Semantic Trajectories for Understanding POI Check-ins), a large-scale, publicly available benchmark dataset built upon the Semantic Trails dataset and enriched with semantic POI metadata. Massive-STEPS spans 12 geographically and culturally diverse cities and features more recent (2017-2018) and longer-duration (24 months) check-in data than prior datasets. We benchmarked a wide range of POI recommendation models on Massive-STEPS using both supervised and zero-shot approaches, and evaluated their performance across multiple urban contexts. By releasing Massive-STEPS, we aim to facilitate reproducible and equitable research in human mobility and POI recommendation. The dataset and benchmarking code are available at: https://github.com/cruiseresearchgroup/Massive-STEPS</p></details> |  |

Operating in such settings presents many challenges -- most notably, because the agent cannot predict the ground-truth future paths of obstacles, a previously planned trajectory can become unsafe at any moment, requiring rapid replanning to avoid collisions. Recently developed planners have used soft-constraint approaches to achieve the necessary fast computation times; however, these methods do not guarantee collision-free paths even with static obstacles. In contrast, hard-constraint methods ensure collision-free safety, but typically have longer computation times. To address these issues, we propose three key contributions. First, the DYNUS Global Planner (DGP) and Temporal Safe Corridor Generation operate in spatio-temporal space and handle both static and dynamic obstacles in the 3D environment. Second, the Safe Planning Framework leverages a combination of exploratory, safe, and contingency trajectories to flexibly re-route when potential future collisions with dynamic obstacles are detected. Finally, the Fast Hard-Constraint Local Trajectory Formulation uses a variable elimination approach to reduce the problem size and enable faster computation by pre-computing dependencies between free and dependent variables while still ensuring collision-free trajectories. We evaluated DYNUS in a variety of simulations, including dense forests, confined office spaces, cave systems, and dynamic environments. Our experiments show that DYNUS achieves a success rate of 100% and travel times that are approximately 25.0% faster than state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluated DYNUS on multiple platforms -- a quadrotor, a wheeled robot, and a quadruped -- in both simulation and hardware experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 30 figures, Under review at IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |

In such systems, maintaining both real-time state awareness (for online decision making) and accurate reconstruction of historical trajectories (for offline post-processing) are essential. While the Age of Information (AoI) metric has been extensively studied as a measure of freshness, it does not capture the accuracy with which past trajectories can be reconstructed. In this work, we investigate reconstruction error as a complementary metric to AoI, addressing the trade-off between timely updates and historical accuracy. Specifically, we consider three policies, each prioritizing different aspects of information management: Keep-Old, Keep-Fresh, and our proposed Inter-arrival-Aware dropping policy. We compare these policies in terms of impact on both AoI and reconstruction error in a remote tracking system with a finite buffer. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations of queueing behavior, we demonstrate that while the Keep-Fresh policy minimizes AoI, it does not necessarily minimize reconstruction error. In contrast, our proposed Inter-arrival-Aware dropping policy dynamically adjusts packet retention decisions based on generation times, achieving a balance between AoI and reconstruction error. Our results provide key insights into the design of efficient buffer management policies for resource-constrained IoT networks.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, GMPA integrates essential features from the Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA) into the GWO framework, enabling superior performance through enhanced exploration and exploitation balance. The evaluation utilizes the GTOPX benchmark dataset from the European Space Agency (ESA), encompassing highly complex interplanetary trajectory optimization problems characterized by pronounced nonlinearity and multiple conflicting objectives reflective of real-world aerospace scenarios. Central to GMPA's methodology is an elite matrix, borrowed from MPA, designed to preserve and refine high-quality solutions iteratively, thereby promoting solution diversity and minimizing premature convergence. Furthermore, GMPA incorporates a three-phase position updating mechanism combined with L\'evy flights and Brownian motion to significantly bolster exploration capabilities, effectively mitigating the risk of stagnation in local optima. GMPA dynamically retains historical information on promising search areas, leveraging the memory storage features intrinsic to MPA, facilitating targeted exploitation and refinement. Empirical evaluations demonstrate GMPA's superior effectiveness compared to traditional GWO and other advanced metaheuristic algorithms, achieving markedly improved convergence rates and solution quality across GTOPX benchmarks. Consequently, GMPA emerges as a robust, efficient, and adaptive optimization approach particularly suitable for high-dimensional and complex aerospace trajectory optimization, offering significant insights and practical advancements in hybrid metaheuristic optimization techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory-Integrated Accessibility Analysis of Public Electric Vehicle Charging Stations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12145v1)** | 2025-05-17 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2505.12145v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is crucial for advancing EV adoption, managing charging loads, and ensuring equitable transportation electrification. However, there remains a notable gap in comprehensive accessibility metrics that integrate the mobility of the users. This study introduces a novel accessibility metric, termed Trajectory-Integrated Public EVCS Accessibility (TI-acs), and uses it to assess public electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) accessibility for approximately 6 million residents in the San Francisco Bay Area based on detailed individual trajectory data in one week. Unlike conventional home-based metrics, TI-acs incorporates the accessibility of EVCS along individuals' travel trajectories, bringing insights on more public charging contexts, including public charging near workplaces and charging during grid off-peak periods. As of June 2024, given the current public EVCS network, Bay Area residents have, on average, 7.5 hours and 5.2 hours of access per day during which their stay locations are within 1 km (i.e. 10-12 min walking) of a public L2 and DCFC charging port, respectively. Over the past decade, TI-acs has steadily increased from the rapid expansion of the EV market and charging infrastructure. However, spatial disparities remain significant, as reflected in Gini indices of 0.38 (L2) and 0.44 (DCFC) across census tracts. Additionally, our analysis reveals racial disparities in TI-acs, driven not only by variations in charging infrastructure near residential areas but also by differences in their mobility patterns.</p></details> | 19 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Knowledge-Informed Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction at Signalized Intersections for Infrastructure-to-Everything](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13461v2)** | 2025-05-17 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2501.13461v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent trajectory prediction at signalized intersections is crucial for developing efficient intelligent transportation systems and safe autonomous driving systems. Due to the complexity of intersection scenarios and the limitations of single-vehicle perception, the performance of vehicle-centric prediction methods has reached a plateau. In this paper, we introduce an Infrastructure-to-Everything (I2X) collaborative prediction scheme. In this scheme, roadside units (RSUs) independently forecast the future trajectories of all vehicles and transmit these predictions unidirectionally to subscribing vehicles. Building on this scheme, we propose I2XTraj, a dedicated infrastructure-based trajectory prediction model. I2XTraj leverages real-time traffic signal states, prior maneuver strategy knowledge, and multi-agent interactions to generate accurate, joint multi-modal trajectory prediction. First, a continuous signal-informed mechanism is proposed to adaptively process real-time traffic signals to guide trajectory proposal generation under varied intersection configurations. Second, a driving strategy awareness mechanism estimates the joint distribution of maneuver strategies by integrating spatial priors of intersection areas with dynamic vehicle states, enabling coverage of the full set of feasible maneuvers. Third, a spatial-temporal-mode attention network models multi-agent interactions to refine and adjust joint trajectory outputs.Finally, I2XTraj is evaluated on two real-world datasets of signalized intersections, the V2X-Seq and the SinD drone dataset. In both single-infrastructure and online collaborative scenarios, our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 30\% on V2X-Seq and 15\% on SinD, demonstrating strong generalizability and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Employing Laban Shape for Generating Emotionally and Functionally Expressive Trajectories in Robotic Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11716v1)** | 2025-05-16 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2505.11716v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Successful human-robot collaboration depends on cohesive communication and a precise understanding of the robot's abilities, goals, and constraints. While robotic manipulators offer high precision, versatility, and productivity, they exhibit expressionless and monotonous motions that conceal the robot's intention, resulting in a lack of efficiency and transparency with humans. In this work, we use Laban notation, a dance annotation language, to enable robotic manipulators to generate trajectories with functional expressivity, where the robot uses nonverbal cues to communicate its abilities and the likelihood of succeeding at its task. We achieve this by introducing two novel variants of Hesitant expressive motion (Spoke-Like and Arc-Like). We also enhance the emotional expressivity of four existing emotive trajectories (Happy, Sad, Shy, and Angry) by augmenting Laban Effort usage with Laban Shape. The functionally expressive motions are validated via a human-subjects study, where participants equate both variants of Hesitant motion with reduced robot competency. The enhanced emotive trajectories are shown to be viewed as distinct emotions using the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) spectrum, corroborating the usage of Laban Shape.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review for the 2025 IEEE RO-MAN Conference</p></details> |
