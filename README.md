| **[Learning Spatially-Aware Language and Audio Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11369v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans can picture a sound scene given an imprecise natural language description. For example, it is easy to imagine an acoustic environment given a phrase like "the lion roar came from right behind me!". For a machine to have the same degree of comprehension, the machine must know what a lion is (semantic attribute), what the concept of "behind" is (spatial attribute) and how these pieces of linguistic information align with the semantic and spatial attributes of the sound (what a roar sounds like when its coming from behind). State-of-the-art audio foundation models which learn to map between audio scenes and natural textual descriptions, are trained on non-spatial audio and text pairs, and hence lack spatial awareness. In contrast, sound event localization and detection models are limited to recognizing sounds from a fixed number of classes, and they localize the source to absolute position (e.g., 0.2m) rather than a position described using natural language (e.g., "next to me"). To address these gaps, we present ELSA a spatially aware-audio and text embedding model trained using multimodal contrastive learning. ELSA supports non-spatial audio, spatial audio, and open vocabulary text captions describing both the spatial and semantic components of sound. To train ELSA: (a) we spatially augment the audio and captions of three open-source audio datasets totaling 4,738 hours of audio, and (b) we design an encoder to capture the semantics of non-spatial audio, and the semantics and spatial attributes of spatial audio using contrastive learning. ELSA is competitive with state-of-the-art for both semantic retrieval and 3D source localization. In particular, ELSA achieves +2.8% mean audio-to-text and text-to-audio R@1 above the baseline, and outperforms by -11.6{\deg} mean-absolute-error in 3D source localization over the baseline.</p></details> | 25 pages, 7 figures |
| **[SpatialBot: Precise Spatial Understanding with Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13642v6)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in 2D image understanding, however they are still struggling with spatial understanding which is the foundation of Embodied AI. In this paper, we propose SpatialBot for better spatial understanding by feeding both RGB and depth images. Additionally, we have constructed the SpatialQA dataset, which involves multi-level depth-related questions to train VLMs for depth understanding. Finally, we present SpatialBench to comprehensively evaluate VLMs' capabilities in spatial understanding at different levels. Extensive experiments on our spatial-understanding benchmark, general VLM benchmarks and Embodied AI tasks, demonstrate the remarkable improvements of SpatialBot trained on SpatialQA. The model, code and data are available at https://github.com/BAAI-DCAI/SpatialBot.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robo-GS: A Physics Consistent Spatial-Temporal Model for Robotic Arm with Hybrid Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14873v2)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real2Sim2Real plays a critical role in robotic arm control and reinforcement learning, yet bridging this gap remains a significant challenge due to the complex physical properties of robots and the objects they manipulate. Existing methods lack a comprehensive solution to accurately reconstruct real-world objects with spatial representations and their associated physics attributes. We propose a Real2Sim pipeline with a hybrid representation model that integrates mesh geometry, 3D Gaussian kernels, and physics attributes to enhance the digital asset representation of robotic arms. This hybrid representation is implemented through a Gaussian-Mesh-Pixel binding technique, which establishes an isomorphic mapping between mesh vertices and Gaussian models. This enables a fully differentiable rendering pipeline that can be optimized through numerical solvers, achieves high-fidelity rendering via Gaussian Splatting, and facilitates physically plausible simulation of the robotic arm's interaction with its environment using mesh-based methods. The code,full presentation and datasets will be made publicly available at our website https://robostudioapp.com</p></details> |  |
| **[Scale generalisation properties of extended scale-covariant and scale-invariant Gaussian derivative networks on image datasets with spatial scaling variations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11140v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the scale generalisation properties of the scale-covariant and scale-invariant Gaussian derivative networks, complemented with both conceptual and algorithmic extensions. For this purpose, Gaussian derivative networks are evaluated on new rescaled versions of the Fashion-MNIST and the CIFAR-10 datasets, with spatial scaling variations over a factor of 4 in the testing data, that are not present in the training data. Additionally, evaluations on the previously existing STIR datasets show that the Gaussian derivative networks achieve better scale generalisation than previously reported for these datasets for other types of deep networks. We first experimentally demonstrate that the Gaussian derivative networks have quite good scale generalisation properties on the new datasets, and that average pooling of feature responses over scales may sometimes also lead to better results than the previously used approach of max pooling over scales. Then, we demonstrate that using a spatial max pooling mechanism after the final layer enables localisation of non-centred objects in image domain, with maintained scale generalisation properties. We also show that regularisation during training, by applying dropout across the scale channels, referred to as scale-channel dropout, improves both the performance and the scale generalisation. In additional ablation studies, we demonstrate that discretisations of Gaussian derivative networks, based on the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel in combination with central difference operators, perform best or among the best, compared to a set of other discrete approximations of the Gaussian derivative kernels. Finally, by visualising the activation maps and the learned receptive fields, we demonstrate that the Gaussian derivative networks have very good explainability properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 23 figures, 16 tables</p></details> |
| **[Mobility-GNN: a human mobility-based graph neural network for tracking and analyzing the spatial dynamics of the synthetic opioid crisis in the USA, 2013-2020](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09945v2)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic opioids are the most common drugs involved in drug-involved overdose mortalities in the U.S. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in 2018, about 70% of all drug overdose deaths involved opioids and 67% of all opioid-involved deaths were accounted for by synthetic opioids. In this study, we investigated the spread of synthetic opioids between 2013 and 2020 in the U.S., and analyzed the relationship between the spatiotemporal pattern of synthetic opioid-involved deaths and another key opioid, heroin, and compared patterns of deaths involving these two types of drugs during this time period. Spatial connections between counties were incorporated into a graph convolutional neural network model to represent and analyze the spread of synthetic opioid-involved deaths, and in the context of heroin-involved deaths.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgileFormer: Spatially Agile Transformer UNet for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00122v2)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the past decades, deep neural networks, particularly convolutional neural networks, have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a variety of medical image segmentation tasks. Recently, the introduction of the vision transformer (ViT) has significantly altered the landscape of deep segmentation models. There has been a growing focus on ViTs, driven by their excellent performance and scalability. However, we argue that the current design of the vision transformer-based UNet (ViT-UNet) segmentation models may not effectively handle the heterogeneous appearance (e.g., varying shapes and sizes) of objects of interest in medical image segmentation tasks. To tackle this challenge, we present a structured approach to introduce spatially dynamic components to the ViT-UNet. This adaptation enables the model to effectively capture features of target objects with diverse appearances. This is achieved by three main components: \textbf{(i)} deformable patch embedding; \textbf{(ii)} spatially dynamic multi-head attention; \textbf{(iii)} deformable positional encoding. These components were integrated into a novel architecture, termed AgileFormer. AgileFormer is a spatially agile ViT-UNet designed for medical image segmentation. Experiments in three segmentation tasks using publicly available datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code is available at \href{https://github.com/sotiraslab/AgileFormer}{https://github.com/sotiraslab/AgileFormer}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation from Spatial Registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10422v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised medical image segmentation has shown promise in training models with limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data. However, state-of-the-art methods ignore a potentially valuable source of unsupervised semantic information -- spatial registration transforms between image volumes. To address this, we propose CCT-R, a contrastive cross-teaching framework incorporating registration information. To leverage the semantic information available in registrations between volume pairs, CCT-R incorporates two proposed modules: Registration Supervision Loss (RSL) and Registration-Enhanced Positive Sampling (REPS). The RSL leverages segmentation knowledge derived from transforms between labeled and unlabeled volume pairs, providing an additional source of pseudo-labels. REPS enhances contrastive learning by identifying anatomically-corresponding positives across volumes using registration transforms. Experimental results on two challenging medical segmentation benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of CCT-R across various semi-supervised settings, with as few as one labeled case. Our code is available at https://github.com/kathyliu579/ContrastiveCross-teachingWithRegistration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Joint Spectral and Spatial Learning with MAMBA for Multichannel Speech Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10376v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multichannel speech enhancement, effectively capturing spatial and spectral information across different microphones is crucial for noise reduction. Traditional methods, such as CNN or LSTM, attempt to model the temporal dynamics of full-band and sub-band spectral and spatial features. However, these approaches face limitations in fully modeling complex temporal dependencies, especially in dynamic acoustic environments. To overcome these challenges, we modify the current advanced model McNet by introducing an improved version of Mamba, a state-space model, and further propose MCMamba. MCMamba has been completely reengineered to integrate full-band and narrow-band spatial information with sub-band and full-band spectral features, providing a more comprehensive approach to modeling spatial and spectral information. Our experimental results demonstrate that MCMamba significantly improves the modeling of spatial and spectral features in multichannel speech enhancement, outperforming McNet and achieving state-of-the-art performance on the CHiME-3 dataset. Additionally, we find that Mamba performs exceptionally well in modeling spectral information.</p></details> |  |
| **[DreamHead: Learning Spatial-Temporal Correspondence via Hierarchical Diffusion for Audio-driven Talking Head Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10281v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-driven talking head synthesis strives to generate lifelike video portraits from provided audio. The diffusion model, recognized for its superior quality and robust generalization, has been explored for this task. However, establishing a robust correspondence between temporal audio cues and corresponding spatial facial expressions with diffusion models remains a significant challenge in talking head generation. To bridge this gap, we present DreamHead, a hierarchical diffusion framework that learns spatial-temporal correspondences in talking head synthesis without compromising the model's intrinsic quality and adaptability.~DreamHead learns to predict dense facial landmarks from audios as intermediate signals to model the spatial and temporal correspondences.~Specifically, a first hierarchy of audio-to-landmark diffusion is first designed to predict temporally smooth and accurate landmark sequences given audio sequence signals. Then, a second hierarchy of landmark-to-image diffusion is further proposed to produce spatially consistent facial portrait videos, by modeling spatial correspondences between the dense facial landmark and appearance. Extensive experiments show that proposed DreamHead can effectively learn spatial-temporal consistency with the designed hierarchical diffusion and produce high-fidelity audio-driven talking head videos for multiple identities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Precise Tool to Target Positioning Widgets (TOTTA) in Spatial Environments: A Systematic Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10239v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>TOTTA outlines the spatial position and rotation guidance of a real/virtual tool (TO) towards a real/virtual target (TA), which is a key task in Mixed Reality applications. The task error can have critical consequences regarding safety, performance, and quality, such as in surgical implantology or industrial maintenance scenarios. The TOTTA problem lacks a dedicated study and is scattered across different domains with isolated designs. This work contributes to a systematic review of the TOTTA visual widgets, studying 70 unique designs from 24 papers. TOTTA is commonly guided by visual overlap an intuitive, pre-attentive 'collimation' feedback of simple-shaped widgets: Box, 3D Axes, 3D Model, 2D Crosshair, Globe, Tetrahedron, Line, and Plane. Our research discovers that TO and TA are often represented with the same shape. They are distinguished by topological elements (e.g., edges, vertices, faces), colors, transparency levels, and added shapes, widget quantity, and size. Meanwhile, some designs provide continuous 'during manipulation feedback' relative to the distance between TO and TA by text, dynamic color, sonification, and amplified graphical visualization. Some approaches trigger discrete 'TA reached feedback,' such as color alteration, added sound, TA shape change, and added text. We found a lack of golden standards, including in testing procedures, as current ones are limited to partial sets with different and incomparable setups (different target configurations, avatar, background, etc.). We also found a bias in participants: right-handed, young male, non-color impaired.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Spectral Graph Neural Networks with Spatially Adaptive Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09071v5)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whilst spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are theoretically well-founded in the spectral domain, their practical reliance on polynomial approximation implies a profound linkage to the spatial domain. As previous studies rarely examine spectral GNNs from the spatial perspective, their spatial-domain interpretability remains elusive, e.g., what information is essentially encoded by spectral GNNs in the spatial domain? In this paper, to answer this question, we establish a theoretical connection between spectral filtering and spatial aggregation, unveiling an intrinsic interaction that spectral filtering implicitly leads the original graph to an adapted new graph, explicitly computed for spatial aggregation. Both theoretical and empirical investigations reveal that the adapted new graph not only exhibits non-locality but also accommodates signed edge weights to reflect label consistency among nodes. These findings thus highlight the interpretable role of spectral GNNs in the spatial domain and inspire us to rethink graph spectral filters beyond the fixed-order polynomials, which neglect global information. Built upon the theoretical findings, we revisit the state-of-the-art spectral GNNs and propose a novel Spatially Adaptive Filtering (SAF) framework, which leverages the adapted new graph by spectral filtering for an auxiliary non-local aggregation. Notably, our proposed SAF comprehensively models both node similarity and dissimilarity from a global perspective, therefore alleviating persistent deficiencies of GNNs related to long-range dependencies and graph heterophily. Extensive experiments over 13 node classification benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework to the state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial occupancy models for data collected on stream networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10017v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To effectively monitor biodiversity in streams and rivers, we need to quantify species distribution accurately. Occupancy models are useful for distinguishing between the non-detection of a species and its actual absence. While these models can account for spatial autocorrelation, they are not suited for streams and rivers due to their unique network spatial structure. Here, I propose spatial occupancy models specifically designed for data collected on stream and river networks. I present the statistical developments and illustrate their application using data on a semi-aquatic mammal. Overall, spatial stream network occupancy models offer a robust method for assessing biodiversity in freshwater ecosystems.</p></details> | 16 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Spatial Transformer Network YOLO Model for Agricultural Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21652v2)** | 2024-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection plays a crucial role in the field of computer vision by autonomously locating and identifying objects of interest. The You Only Look Once (YOLO) model is an effective single-shot detector. However, YOLO faces challenges in cluttered or partially occluded scenes and can struggle with small, low-contrast objects. We propose a new method that integrates spatial transformer networks (STNs) into YOLO to improve performance. The proposed STN-YOLO aims to enhance the model's effectiveness by focusing on important areas of the image and improving the spatial invariance of the model before the detection process. Our proposed method improved object detection performance both qualitatively and quantitatively. We explore the impact of different localization networks within the STN module as well as the robustness of the model across different spatial transformations. We apply the STN-YOLO on benchmark datasets for Agricultural object detection as well as a new dataset from a state-of-the-art plant phenotyping greenhouse facility. Our code and dataset are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, accepted to 2024 IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications</p></details> |
| **[Reasoning Paths with Reference Objects Elicit Quantitative Spatial Reasoning in Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09788v1)** | 2024-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances demonstrating vision-language models' (VLMs) abilities to describe complex relationships in images using natural language, their capability to quantitatively reason about object sizes and distances remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce a manually annotated benchmark, Q-Spatial Bench, with 271 questions across five categories designed for quantitative spatial reasoning and systematically investigate the performance of state-of-the-art VLMs on this task. Our analysis reveals that reasoning about distances between objects is particularly challenging for SoTA VLMs; however, some VLMs significantly outperform others, with an over 40-point gap between the two best performing models. We also make the surprising observation that the success rate of the top-performing VLM increases by 19 points when a reasoning path using a reference object emerges naturally in the response. Inspired by this observation, we develop a zero-shot prompting technique, SpatialPrompt, that encourages VLMs to answer quantitative spatial questions using reference objects as visual cues. By instructing VLMs to use reference objects in their reasoning paths via SpatialPrompt, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and GPT-4V improve their success rates by over 40, 20, and 30 points, respectively. We emphasize that these significant improvements are obtained without needing more data, model architectural modifications, or fine-tuning.</p></details> | 20 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Space3D-Bench: Spatial 3D Question Answering Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16662v3)** | 2024-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Answering questions about the spatial properties of the environment poses challenges for existing language and vision foundation models due to a lack of understanding of the 3D world notably in terms of relationships between objects. To push the field forward, multiple 3D Q&A datasets were proposed which, overall, provide a variety of questions, but they individually focus on particular aspects of 3D reasoning or are limited in terms of data modalities. To address this, we present Space3D-Bench - a collection of 1000 general spatial questions and answers related to scenes of the Replica dataset which offers a variety of data modalities: point clouds, posed RGB-D images, navigation meshes and 3D object detections. To ensure that the questions cover a wide range of 3D objectives, we propose an indoor spatial questions taxonomy inspired by geographic information systems and use it to balance the dataset accordingly. Moreover, we provide an assessment system that grades natural language responses based on predefined ground-truth answers by leveraging a Vision Language Model's comprehension of both text and images to compare the responses with ground-truth textual information or relevant visual data. Finally, we introduce a baseline called RAG3D-Chat integrating the world understanding of foundation models with rich context retrieval, achieving an accuracy of 67% on the proposed dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Hyperspectral and Multispectral Image Blind Fusion Based on Deep Tucker Decomposition Network with Spatial-Spectral Manifold Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09670v1)** | 2024-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral and multispectral image fusion aims to generate high spectral and spatial resolution hyperspectral images (HR-HSI) by fusing high-resolution multispectral images (HR-MSI) and low-resolution hyperspectral images (LR-HSI). However, existing fusion methods encounter challenges such as unknown degradation parameters, incomplete exploitation of the correlation between high-dimensional structures and deep image features. To overcome these issues, in this article, an unsupervised blind fusion method for hyperspectral and multispectral images based on Tucker decomposition and spatial spectral manifold learning (DTDNML) is proposed. We design a novel deep Tucker decomposition network that maps LR-HSI and HR-MSI into a consistent feature space, achieving reconstruction through decoders with shared parameter. To better exploit and fuse spatial-spectral features in the data, we design a core tensor fusion network that incorporates a spatial spectral attention mechanism for aligning and fusing features at different scales. Furthermore, to enhance the capacity in capturing global information, a Laplacian-based spatial-spectral manifold constraints is introduced in shared-decoders. Sufficient experiments have validated that this method enhances the accuracy and efficiency of hyperspectral and multispectral fusion on different remote sensing datasets.

| **[Spatial-Temporal Mamba Network for EEG-based Motor Imagery Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09627v1)** | 2024-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motor imagery (MI) classification is key for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Until recent years, numerous models had been proposed, ranging from classical algorithms like Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) to deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers. However, these models have shown limitations in areas such as generalizability, contextuality and scalability when it comes to effectively extracting the complex spatial-temporal information inherent in electroencephalography (EEG) signals. To address these limitations, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Mamba Network (STMambaNet), an innovative model leveraging the Mamba state space architecture, which excels in processing extended sequences with linear scalability. By incorporating spatial and temporal Mamba encoders, STMambaNet effectively captures the intricate dynamics in both space and time, significantly enhancing the decoding performance of EEG signals for MI classification. Experimental results on BCI Competition IV 2a and 2b datasets demonstrate STMambaNet's superiority over existing models, establishing it as a powerful tool for advancing MI-based BCIs and improving real-world BCI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages,3 figures, accepted conference:ADMA2024</p></details> |

Hypergraphs, which generalize graphs by allowing edges to connect any number of nodes, provide a flexible and powerful framework for modeling such higher-order relationships. In this work, we introduce hypergraph diffusion wavelets and describe their favorable spectral and spatial properties. We demonstrate their utility for biomedical discovery in spatially resolved transcriptomics by applying the method to represent disease-relevant cellular niches for Alzheimer's disease.</p></details> |  |
| **[Normalizing Basis Functions: Approximate Stationary Models for Large Spatial Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13821v3)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In geostatistics, traditional spatial models often rely on the Gaussian Process (GP) to fit stationary covariances to data. It is well known that this approach becomes computationally infeasible when dealing with large data volumes, necessitating the use of approximate methods. A powerful class of methods approximate the GP as a sum of basis functions with random coefficients. Although this technique offers computational efficiency, it does not inherently guarantee a stationary covariance. To mitigate this issue, the basis functions can be "normalized" to maintain a constant marginal variance, avoiding unwanted artifacts and edge effects. This allows for the fitting of nearly stationary models to large, potentially non-stationary datasets, providing a rigorous base to extend to more complex problems. Unfortunately, the process of normalizing these basis functions is computationally demanding. To address this, we introduce two fast and accurate algorithms to the normalization step, allowing for efficient prediction on fine grids. The practical value of these algorithms is showcased in the context of a spatial analysis on a large dataset, where significant computational speedups are achieved. While implementation and testing are done specifically within the LatticeKrig framework, these algorithms can be adapted to other basis function methods operating on regular grids.</p></details> | Version 3 |
| **[Joint spatial modeling of mean and non-homogeneous variance combining semiparametric SAR and GAMLSS models for hedonic prices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08912v1)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of spatial econometrics, it is very useful to have methodologies that allow modeling the spatial dependence of the observed variables and obtaining more precise predictions of both the mean and the variability of the response variable, something very useful in territorial planning and public policies. This paper proposes a new methodology that jointly models the mean and the variance. Also, it allows to model the spatial dependence of the dependent variable as a function of covariates and to model the semiparametric effects in both models. The algorithms developed are based on generalized additive models that allow the inclusion of non-parametric terms in both the mean and the variance, maintaining the traditional theoretical framework of spatial regression. The theoretical developments of the estimation of this model are carried out, obtaining desirable statistical properties in the estimators. A simulation study is developed to verify that the proposed method has a remarkable predictive capacity in terms of the mean square error and shows a notable improvement in the estimation of the spatial autoregressive parameter, compared to other traditional methods and some recent developments. The model is also tested on data from the construction of a hedonic price model for the city of Bogota, highlighting as the main result the ability to model the variability of housing prices, and the wealth in the analysis obtained.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tracing the impacts of Mount Pinatubo eruption on global climate using spatially-varying changepoint detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08908v1)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Significant events such as volcanic eruptions can have global and long lasting impacts on climate. These global impacts, however, are not uniform across space and time. Understanding how the Mt. Pinatubo eruption affects global and regional climate is of great interest for predicting impact on climate due to similar events. We propose a Bayesian framework to simultaneously detect and estimate spatially-varying temporal changepoints for regional climate impacts. Our approach takes into account the diffusing nature of the changes caused by the volcanic eruption and leverages spatial correlation. We illustrate our method on simulated datasets and compare it with an existing changepoint detection method. Finally, we apply our method on monthly stratospheric aerosol optical depth and surface temperature data from 1985 to 1995 to detect and estimate changepoints following the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption.</p></details> |  |
| **[Linear Attention is Enough in Spatial-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09158v2)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the most representative scenario of spatial-temporal forecasting tasks, the traffic forecasting task attracted numerous attention from machine learning community due to its intricate correlation both in space and time dimension. Existing methods often treat road networks over time as spatial-temporal graphs, addressing spatial and temporal representations independently. However, these approaches struggle to capture the dynamic topology of road networks, encounter issues with message passing mechanisms and over-smoothing, and face challenges in learning spatial and temporal relationships separately. To address these limitations, we propose treating nodes in road networks at different time steps as independent spatial-temporal tokens and feeding them into a vanilla Transformer to learn complex spatial-temporal patterns, design \textbf{STformer} achieving SOTA. Given its quadratic complexity, we introduce a variant \textbf{NSTformer} based on Nystr$\ddot{o}$m method to approximate self-attention with linear complexity but even slightly better than former in a few cases astonishingly. Extensive experimental results on traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance at an affordable computational cost.

| **[Spatial Adaptation Layer: Interpretable Domain Adaptation For Biosignal Sensor Array Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08058v1)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biosignal acquisition is key for healthcare applications and wearable devices, with machine learning offering promising methods for processing signals like surface electromyography (sEMG) and electroencephalography (EEG). Despite high within-session performance, intersession performance is hindered by electrode shift, a known issue across modalities. Existing solutions often require large and expensive datasets and/or lack robustness and interpretability. Thus, we propose the Spatial Adaptation Layer (SAL), which can be prepended to any biosignal array model and learns a parametrized affine transformation at the input between two recording sessions. We also introduce learnable baseline normalization (LBN) to reduce baseline fluctuations. Tested on two HD-sEMG gesture recognition datasets, SAL and LBN outperform standard fine-tuning on regular arrays, achieving competitive performance even with a logistic regressor, with orders of magnitude less, physically interpretable parameters. Our ablation study shows that forearm circumferential translations account for the majority of performance improvements, in line with sEMG physiological expectations.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICASS...</summary><p>ICASSP(submitted), 5 pages</p></details> |

Enhancing Spatial Reasoning in Visual Language Models Through 3D Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14133v2)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Language Models (VLMs) are essential for various tasks, particularly visual reasoning tasks, due to their robust multi-modal information integration, visual reasoning capabilities, and contextual awareness. However, existing \VLMs{}' visual spatial reasoning capabilities are often inadequate, struggling even with basic tasks such as distinguishing left from right. To address this, we propose the \ours{} model, designed to enhance the visual spatial reasoning abilities of VLMS. ZeroVLM employs Zero-1-to-3, a 3D reconstruction model for obtaining different views of the input images and incorporates a prompting mechanism to further improve visual spatial reasoning. Experimental results on four visual spatial reasoning datasets show that our \ours{} achieves up to 19.48% accuracy improvement, which indicates the effectiveness of the 3D reconstruction and prompting mechanisms of our ZeroVLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[RIS-Assisted Received Adaptive Spatial Modulation for Wireless Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06894v2)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A novel wireless transmission scheme, as named the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted received adaptive spatial modulation (RASM) scheme, is proposed in this paper. In this scheme, the adaptive spatial modulation (ASM)-based antennas selection works at the receiver by employing the characteristics of the RIS in each time slot, where the signal-to-noise ratio at specific selected antennas can be further enhanced with near few powers. Besides for the bits from constellation symbols, the extra bits can be mapped into the indices of receive antenna combinations and conveyed to the receiver through the ASM-based antenna-combination selection, thus providing higher spectral efficiency. To explicitly present the RASM scheme, the analytical performance of bit error rate of it is discussed in this paper. As a trade-off selection, the proposed scheme shows higher spectral efficiency and remains the satisfactory error performance.

Recent studies on collaborative perception mostly utilize CNNs or Transformers to learn feature representation and fusion in the spatial dimension, which struggle to handle long-range spatial-temporal features under limited computing and communication resources. Holistically modeling the dependencies over extensive spatial areas and extended temporal frames is crucial to enhancing feature quality. To this end, we propose a resource efficient cross-agent spatial-temporal collaborative state space model (SSM), named CollaMamba. Initially, we construct a foundational backbone network based on spatial SSM. This backbone adeptly captures positional causal dependencies from both single-agent and cross-agent views, yielding compact and comprehensive intermediate features while maintaining linear complexity. Furthermore, we devise a history-aware feature boosting module based on temporal SSM, extracting contextual cues from extended historical frames to refine vague features while preserving low overhead. Extensive experiments across several datasets demonstrate that CollaMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher model accuracy while reducing computational and communication overhead by up to 71.9% and 1/64, respectively. This work pioneers the exploration of the Mamba's potential in collaborative perception. The source code will be made available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Specification of an appropriate covariance function for the model can be challenging when complex non-stationarities exist. Recent work has shown that pre-computed spatial basis functions and a feed-forward neural network can capture complex spatial dependence structures while remaining computationally efficient. This paper builds on this literature by tailoring spatial basis functions for use in convolutional neural networks. Through both simulated and real data, we demonstrate that this approach yields more accurate spatial predictions than existing methods. Uncertainty quantification is also considered.</p></details> |  |

Our design uses three linked views: a view of the histological image of the tissue, a stacked bar chart showing cell type proportions of the spots, and a scatter plot showing a dimensionality reduction of the multivariate proportions. Furthermore, we apply a compositional data analysis framework, the Aitchison geometry, to the proportions for dimensionality reduction and $k$-means clustering. Leveraging brushing and linking, the system allows one to explore and uncover patterns in the cell type mixtures and relate them to their spatial locations on the cellular tissue. This redesign shifts the pattern recognition workload from the human visual system to computational methods commonly used in visual analytics. We provide the code and setup instructions of our visual analytics system on GitHub (https://github.com/UniStuttgart-VISUS/va-for-spatial-transcriptomics).</p></details> | <details><summary>2 pag...</summary><p>2 pages, 2 figures, challenge submission accepted by Bio+Med+Vis workshop at IEEE VIS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Clustered Factor Analysis for Multivariate Spatial Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07018v1)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Factor analysis has been extensively used to reveal the dependence structures among multivariate variables, offering valuable insight in various fields. However, it cannot incorporate the spatial heterogeneity that is typically present in spatial data. To address this issue, we introduce an effective method specifically designed to discover the potential dependence structures in multivariate spatial data. Our approach assumes that spatial locations can be approximately divided into a finite number of clusters, with locations within the same cluster sharing similar dependence structures. By leveraging an iterative algorithm that combines spatial clustering with factor analysis, we simultaneously detect spatial clusters and estimate a unique factor model for each cluster. The proposed method is evaluated through comprehensive simulation studies, demonstrating its flexibility. In addition, we apply the proposed method to a dataset of railway station attributes in the Tokyo metropolitan area, highlighting its practical applicability and effectiveness in uncovering complex spatial dependencies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Process-based Inference for Spatial Energetics Using Bayesian Predictive Stacking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09906v3)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid developments in streaming data technologies have enabled real-time monitoring of human activity that can deliver high-resolution data on health variables over trajectories or paths carved out by subjects as they conduct their daily physical activities. Wearable devices, such as wrist-worn sensors that monitor gross motor activity, have become prevalent and have kindled the emerging field of "spatial energetics" in environmental health sciences. We devise a Bayesian inferential framework for analyzing such data while accounting for information available on specific spatial coordinates comprising a trajectory or path using a Global Positioning System (GPS) device embedded within the wearable device. We offer full probabilistic inference with uncertainty quantification using spatial-temporal process models adapted for data generated from "actigraph" units as the subject traverses a path or trajectory in their daily routine. Anticipating the need for fast inference for mobile health data, we pursue exact inference using conjugate Bayesian models and employ predictive stacking to assimilate inference across these individual models. This circumvents issues with iterative estimation algorithms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo. We devise Bayesian predictive stacking in this context for models that treat time as discrete epochs and that treat time as continuous. We illustrate our methods with simulation experiments and analysis of data from the Physical Activity through Sustainable Transport Approaches (PASTA-LA) study conducted by the Fielding School of Public Health at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p></details> | 37 pages, 13 figures |

This approach enables each Gaussian to exhibit a richer representation by accommodating varying colors and opacities across its surface, significantly enhancing rendering quality compared to traditional methods. To demonstrate the merits of our approach, we have adapted the Mini-Splatting architecture to integrate textured Gaussians without increasing the number of Gaussians. Our experiments across multiple real-world datasets show that Textured-GS consistently outperforms both the baseline Mini-Splatting and standard 3DGS in terms of visual fidelity. The results highlight the potential of Textured-GS to advance Gaussian-based rendering technologies, promising more efficient and high-quality scene reconstructions.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Most existing methods are tailored for individual forecasting or imputation tasks but are not designed for both. Additionally, they are less effective for zero-shot and few-shot learning. While pre-trained language model (PLM) have exhibited strong pattern recognition and reasoning abilities across various tasks, including few-shot and zero-shot learning, their applications in spatial-temporal data understanding has been constrained by insufficient modeling of complex correlations such as the temporal correlations, spatial connectivity, non-pairwise and high-order spatial-temporal correlations within data. In this paper, we propose STD-PLM for understanding both spatial and temporal properties of \underline{S}patial-\underline{T}emporal \underline{D}ata with \underline{PLM}, which is capable of implementing both spatial-temporal forecasting and imputation tasks. STD-PLM understands spatial-temporal correlations via explicitly designed spatial and temporal tokenizers. Topology-aware node embeddings are designed for PLM to comprehend and exploit the topology structure of data in inductive manner. Furthermore, to mitigate the efficiency issues introduced by the PLM, we design a sandglass attention module (SGA) combined with a specific constrained loss function, which significantly improves the model's efficiency while ensuring performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STD-PLM exhibits competitive performance and generalization capabilities across the forecasting and imputation tasks on various datasets. Moreover, STD-PLM achieves promising results on both few-shot and zero-shot tasks.The code is made available at \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/STD-PLM-F3BA}{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/STD-PLM-F3BA}</p></details> |  |

While Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have been effective in scene reconstruction, their slow inference speeds and lengthy training durations limit their applicability. To overcome these limitations, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) based methods have emerged as a recent trend, offering rapid inference capabilities and superior 3D quality. However, these methods still struggle with under-reconstruction in both static and dynamic scenes. In this paper, we propose HFGS, a novel approach for deformable endoscopic reconstruction that addresses these challenges from spatial and temporal frequency perspectives. Our approach incorporates deformation fields to better handle dynamic scenes and introduces Spatial High-Frequency Emphasis Reconstruction (SHF) to minimize discrepancies in spatial frequency spectra between the rendered image and its ground truth. Additionally, we introduce Temporal High-Frequency Emphasis Reconstruction (THF) to enhance dynamic awareness in neural rendering by leveraging flow priors, focusing optimization on motion-intensive parts. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate that HFGS achieves superior rendering quality.</p></details> | BMVC2024 |

Here I show that tree-based methods are well suited for the study of these questions as they allow exploring the relationship between proximity metrics and outcomes of interest in a non-parametric and data-driven manner. I illustrate the usefulness of tree-based methods vis-\`a-vis conventional regression methods by examining the association between: (i) distance to border crossings along the US-Mexico border and support for immigration reform, and (ii) distance to mass shootings and support for gun control.</p></details> |  |

The convolution operator, also known as a spatial filter, is usually a linear operation, but this linearity compromises essential features and details inherent in the non-linearity present in many applications. However, due to its slow processing, the use of a nonlinear spatial filter is a significant bottleneck in many software applications. Further, due to their complexity, they are difficult to accelerate in FPGA or VLSI architectures. This paper presents novel FPGA implementations of linear and nonlinear spatial filters. More specifically, the arithmetic computations are carried out in custom floating-point, enabling a tradeoff of precision and hardware compactness, reducing algorithm development time. Further, we show that it is possible to process video at a resolution of 1080p with a frame rate of 60 frames per second, using a low-cost FPGA board. Finally, we show that using a domain-specific language will allow the rapid prototyping of image processing algorithms in custom floating-point arithmetic, allowing non-experts to quickly develop real-time video processing applications.</p></details> |  |

We validated its disentanglement, identifiability, and counterfactual prediction capabilities through simulations and in clinically relevant human glioblastoma, human fetal spleen, and mouse lung cancer samples. Celcomen provides the means to model disease and therapy induced changes allowing for new insights into single-cell spatially resolved tissue responses relevant to human health.</p></details> |  |

On this front, we study the task of generating highly detailed navigational instructions for the embodied robots to follow. Although recent studies have demonstrated significant leaps in the generation of step-by-step instructions from sequences of images, the generated instructions lack variety in terms of their referral to objects and landmarks. Existing speaker models learn strategies to evade the evaluation metrics and obtain higher scores even for low-quality sentences. In this work, we propose SAS (Spatially-Aware Speaker), an instruction generator or \textit{Speaker} model that utilises both structural and semantic knowledge of the environment to produce richer instructions. For training, we employ a reward learning method in an adversarial setting to avoid systematic bias introduced by language evaluation metrics. Empirically, our method outperforms existing instruction generation models, evaluated using standard metrics. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/gmuraleekrishna/SAS}.</p></details> |  |

The two chief aims of sfislands are to simplify the process of creating an appropriate neighbourhood matrix, and to quickly visualise the predictions of subsequent models. The package uses visual aids in the form of easily-generated maps to help this process. This paper demonstrates how sfislands could be useful to researchers. It begins by describing the package's functions in the context of a proposed workflow. It then presents three worked examples showing a selection of potential use-cases.

| **[A general reduced-order neural operator for spatio-temporal predictive learning on complex spatial domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05508v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive learning for spatio-temporal processes (PL-STP) on complex spatial domains plays a critical role in various scientific and engineering fields, with its essence being the construction of operators between infinite-dimensional function spaces. This paper focuses on the unequal-domain mappings in PL-STP and categorising them into increase-domain and decrease-domain mapping. Recent advances in deep learning have revealed the great potential of neural operators (NOs) to learn operators directly from observational data. However, existing NOs require input space and output space to be the same domain, which pose challenges in ensuring predictive accuracy and stability for unequal-domain mappings. To this end, this study presents a general reduced-order neural operator named Reduced-Order Neural Operator on Riemannian Manifolds (RO-NORM), which consists of two parts: the unequal-domain encoder/decoder and the same-domain approximator. Motivated by the variable separation in classical modal decomposition, the unequal-domain encoder/decoder uses the pre-computed bases to reformulate the spatio-temporal function as a sum of products between spatial (or temporal) bases and corresponding temporally (or spatially) distributed weight functions, thus the original unequal-domain mapping can be converted into a same-domain mapping. Consequently, the same-domain approximator NORM is applied to model the transformed mapping. The performance of our proposed method has been evaluated on six benchmark cases, including parametric PDEs, engineering and biomedical applications, and compared with four baseline algorithms: DeepONet, POD-DeepONet, PCA-Net, and vanilla NORM. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of RO-NORM in prediction accuracy and training efficiency for PL-STP.</p></details> |  |

In the last ten years in particular, theoretical knowledge has evolved a lot, whether for the calculation of metrics to characterize interference, coverage, energy or spectral efficiency, or exposure to electromagnetic fields. Many spatial point process models have been developed but are often left aside because of their unfamiliarity, their lack of tractability in favor of the Poisson point process or the regular lattice, easier to use. This article is intended to be a short guide presenting a complete and simple methodology to follow to infer a real stationary macro antenna network using tractable spatial models. The focus is mainly on repulsive point processes and in particular on determinantal point processes which are among the most tractable repulsive point processes. This methodology is applied on Belgian and French cell towers. The results show that for all stationary distributions in France and Belgium, the best inference model is the $\beta$-Ginibre point process.</p></details> | <details><summary>EURO-...</summary><p>EURO-COST CA20120 TD(22)0174</p></details> |
| **[Self-Supervised Learning of Spatial Acoustic Representation with Cross-Channel Signal Reconstruction and Multi-Channel Conformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00476v2)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised learning methods have shown effectiveness in estimating spatial acoustic parameters such as time difference of arrival, direct-to-reverberant ratio and reverberation time. However, they still suffer from the simulation-to-reality generalization problem due to the mismatch between simulated and real-world acoustic characteristics and the deficiency of annotated real-world data. To this end, this work proposes a self-supervised method that takes full advantage of unlabeled data for spatial acoustic parameter estimation. First, a new pretext task, i.e. cross-channel signal reconstruction (CCSR), is designed to learn a universal spatial acoustic representation from unlabeled multi-channel microphone signals. We mask partial signals of one channel and ask the model to reconstruct them, which makes it possible to learn spatial acoustic information from unmasked signals and extract source information from the other microphone channel. An encoder-decoder structure is used to disentangle the two kinds of information. By fine-tuning the pre-trained spatial encoder with a small annotated dataset, this encoder can be used to estimate spatial acoustic parameters. Second, a novel multi-channel audio Conformer (MC-Conformer) is adopted as the encoder model architecture, which is suitable for both the pretext and downstream tasks. It is carefully designed to be able to capture the local and global characteristics of spatial acoustics exhibited in the time-frequency domain. Experimental results of five acoustic parameter estimation tasks on both simulated and real-world data show the effectiveness of the proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first self-supervised learning method in the field of spatial acoustic representation learning and multi-channel audio signal processing.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing dimension reduction techniques do not account for the spatial correlation between observations and do not take the downstream modeling task into consideration when finding the lower-dimensional representation. We formalize the closeness of approximation to the original data and the utility of lower-dimensional scores for downstream modeling as two complementary, sometimes conflicting, metrics for dimension reduction. We illustrate how existing methodologies fall into this framework and propose a flexible dimension reduction algorithm that achieves the optimal trade-off. We derive a computationally simple form for our algorithm and illustrate its performance through simulation studies, as well as two applications in air pollution modeling and spatial transcriptomics.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, we propose the Spatial-Temporal Large Language Model Diffusion (STLLM-DF), an innovative model that leverages Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve multi-task transportation prediction. The DDPM's robust denoising capabilities enable it to recover underlying data patterns from noisy inputs, making it particularly effective in complex transportation systems. Meanwhile, the non-pretrained LLM dynamically adapts to spatial-temporal relationships within multi-modal networks, allowing the system to efficiently manage diverse transportation tasks in both long-term and short-term predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STLLM-DF consistently outperforms existing models, achieving an average reduction of 2.40\% in MAE, 4.50\% in RMSE, and 1.51\% in MAPE. This model significantly advances centralized ITS by enhancing predictive accuracy, robustness, and overall system performance across multiple tasks, thus paving the way for more effective spatio-temporal traffic forecasting through the integration of frozen transformer language models and diffusion techniques.</p></details> | 26 pages, 11 figures |

The state-level analysis also faces significant challenges of limited spatial data availability. To address the challenges of spatial dependence and small sample sizes in predicting U.S. presidential election results using spatially dependent data, we propose a novel transfer learning framework within the SAR model, called as tranSAR. Classical SAR model estimation often loses accuracy with small target data samples. Our framework enhances estimation and prediction by leveraging information from similar source data. We introduce a two-stage algorithm, consisting of a transferring stage and a debiasing stage, to estimate parameters and establish theoretical convergence rates for the estimators. Additionally, if the informative source data are unknown, we propose a transferable source detection algorithm using spatial residual bootstrap to maintain spatial dependence and derive its detection consistency. Simulation studies show our algorithm substantially improves the classical two-stage least squares estimator. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness in predicting outcomes in U.S. presidential swing states, where it outperforms traditional methods. In addition, our tranSAR model predicts that the Democratic party will win the 2024 U.S. presidential election.</p></details> |  |

A powerful model is expected to be capable of capturing region-object correspondences and recognizing scene changes in a video clip, reflecting spatial and temporal granularity, respectively. To strengthen model's understanding into such fine-grained details, we propose a simple yet effective video-language modeling framework, S-ViLM, by exploiting the intrinsic structures of these two modalities. It includes two novel designs, inter-clip spatial grounding and intra-clip temporal grouping, to promote learning region-object alignment and temporal-aware features, simultaneously. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that S-ViLM performs favorably against existing approaches in learning more expressive representations.

| **[ActionFlow: Equivariant, Accurate, and Efficient Policies with Spatially Symmetric Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04576v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial understanding is a critical aspect of most robotic tasks, particularly when generalization is important. Despite the impressive results of deep generative models in complex manipulation tasks, the absence of a representation that encodes intricate spatial relationships between observations and actions often limits spatial generalization, necessitating large amounts of demonstrations. To tackle this problem, we introduce a novel policy class, ActionFlow. ActionFlow integrates spatial symmetry inductive biases while generating expressive action sequences. On the representation level, ActionFlow introduces an SE(3) Invariant Transformer architecture, which enables informed spatial reasoning based on the relative SE(3) poses between observations and actions. For action generation, ActionFlow leverages Flow Matching, a state-of-the-art deep generative model known for generating high-quality samples with fast inference - an essential property for feedback control. In combination, ActionFlow policies exhibit strong spatial and locality biases and SE(3)-equivariant action generation. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ActionFlow and its two main components on several simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks and confirm that we can obtain equivariant, accurate, and efficient policies with spatially symmetric flow matching.

However, current CDMs require a paired segmentation map and echocardiogram dataset. We present a new method called Free-Echo for generating realistic echocardiograms from a single end-diastolic segmentation map without additional training data. Our method is based on the 3D-Unet with Temporal Attention Layers model and is conditioned on the segmentation map using a training-free conditioning method based on SDEdit.

| **[Spatial-frequency Dual-Domain Feature Fusion Network for Low-Light Remote Sensing Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17400v2)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-light remote sensing images generally feature high resolution and high spatial complexity, with continuously distributed surface features in space. This continuity in scenes leads to extensive long-range correlations in spatial domains within remote sensing images. Convolutional Neural Networks, which rely on local correlations for long-distance modeling, struggle to establish long-range correlations in such images. On the other hand, transformer-based methods that focus on global information face high computational complexities when processing high-resolution remote sensing images. From another perspective, Fourier transform can compute global information without introducing a large number of parameters, enabling the network to more efficiently capture the overall image structure and establish long-range correlations. Therefore, we propose a Dual-Domain Feature Fusion Network (DFFN) for low-light remote sensing image enhancement. Specifically, this challenging task of low-light enhancement is divided into two more manageable sub-tasks: the first phase learns amplitude information to restore image brightness, and the second phase learns phase information to refine details. To facilitate information exchange between the two phases, we designed an information fusion affine block that combines data from different phases and scales. Additionally, we have constructed two dark light remote sensing datasets to address the current lack of datasets in dark light remote sensing image enhancement. Extensive evaluations show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/iijjlk/DFFN.</p></details> | 14 page |

Furthermore, we underscore its potential to enhance nonlinear estimation capabilities through the application of transformed fuzzy rules and to quantify the inherent uncertainties associated with the observation data sets.

It produces a three-dimensional auditory environment under headphones and uses a simple repetition response protocol to determine speech reception thresholds (SRTs) for sentences presented in competing speech under various conditions. In order to develop the LiSN-S test in Brazilian Portuguese, it was necessary to prepare a speech database recorded by professional voice actresses and to devise presentation software. These sentences were presented to 35 adults (aged between 19 and 40 years) and 24 children (aged between 8 and 10 years), all with normal hearing-verified through tone and speech audiometry and tympanometry-and good performance at school. We used a logistic curve describing word error rate versus presentation level, fitted for each sentence, to select a set of 120 sentences for the test. Furthermore, all selected sentences were adjusted in amplitude for equal intelligibility. The framework of LiSN-S in Brazilian Portuguese is ready for normative data analysis. After its conclusion, we believe it will contribute to diagnosing and rehabilitating Brazilian children with complaints related to hearing difficulties in noisy environments</p></details> |  |
| **[Visualizing Spatial Semantics of Dimensionally Reduced Text Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03949v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dimension reduction (DR) can transform high-dimensional text embeddings into a 2D visual projection facilitating the exploration of document similarities. However, the projection often lacks connection to the text semantics, due to the opaque nature of text embeddings and non-linear dimension reductions. To address these problems, we propose a gradient-based method for visualizing the spatial semantics of dimensionally reduced text embeddings. This method employs gradients to assess the sensitivity of the projected documents with respect to the underlying words. The method can be applied to existing DR algorithms and text embedding models. Using these gradients, we designed a visualization system that incorporates spatial word clouds into the document projection space to illustrate the impactful text features. We further present three usage scenarios that demonstrate the practical applications of our system to facilitate the discovery and interpretation of underlying semantics in text projections.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Spatial Dependence in Transcriptomics Data using Vectorised Persistence Diagrams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03575v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating spatial patterns in data is an integral task across various domains, including geostatistics, astronomy, and spatial tissue biology. The analysis of transcriptomics data in particular relies on methods for detecting spatially-dependent features that exhibit significant spatial patterns for both explanatory analysis and feature selection. However, given the complex and high-dimensional nature of these data, there is a need for robust, stable, and reliable descriptors of spatial dependence. We leverage the stability and multiscale properties of persistent homology to address this task. To this end, we introduce a novel framework using functional topological summaries, such as Betti curves and persistence landscapes, for identifying and describing non-random patterns in spatial data. In particular, we propose a non-parametric one-sample permutation test for spatial dependence and investigate its utility across both simulated and real spatial omics data. Our vectorised approach outperforms baseline methods at accurately detecting spatial dependence. Further, we find that our method is more robust to outliers than alternative tests using Moran's I.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reducing Spatial Discretization Error on Coarse CFD Simulations Using an OpenFOAM-Embedded Deep Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07441v3)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a method for reducing the spatial discretization error of coarse computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problems by enhancing the quality of low-resolution simulations using deep learning. We feed the model with fine-grid data after projecting it to the coarse-grid discretization. We substitute the default differencing scheme for the convection term by a feed-forward neural network that interpolates velocities from cell centers to face values to produce velocities that approximate the down-sampled fine-grid data well. The deep learning framework incorporates the open-source CFD code OpenFOAM, resulting in an end-to-end differentiable model. We automatically differentiate the CFD physics using a discrete adjoint code version. We present a fast communication method between TensorFlow (Python) and OpenFOAM (c++) that accelerates the training process. We applied the model to the flow past a square cylinder problem, reducing the error from 120% to 25% in the velocity for simulations inside the training distribution compared to the traditional solver using an x8 coarser mesh. For simulations outside the training distribution, the error reduction in the velocities was about 50%. The training is affordable in terms of time and data samples since the architecture exploits the local features of the physics.</p></details> |  |

Using this result, we deduce the discrete stochastic maximal \( L^p \)-regularity estimate for a spatial semidiscretization. Additionally, we provide (almost) optimal error estimates for the semidiscretization under a broad class of spatial \( L^q \)-norms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual-TSST: A Dual-Branch Temporal-Spectral-Spatial Transformer Model for EEG Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03251v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The decoding of electroencephalography (EEG) signals allows access to user intentions conveniently, which plays an important role in the fields of human-machine interaction. To effectively extract sufficient characteristics of the multichannel EEG, a novel decoding architecture network with a dual-branch temporal-spectral-spatial transformer (Dual-TSST) is proposed in this study. Specifically, by utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on different branches, the proposed processing network first extracts the temporal-spatial features of the original EEG and the temporal-spectral-spatial features of time-frequency domain data converted by wavelet transformation, respectively. These perceived features are then integrated by a feature fusion block, serving as the input of the transformer to capture the global long-range dependencies entailed in the non-stationary EEG, and being classified via the global average pooling and multi-layer perceptron blocks. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approach, the competitive experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets of BCI IV 2a, BCI IV 2b, and SEED, with the head-to-head comparison of more than ten other state-of-the-art methods. As a result, our proposed Dual-TSST performs superiorly in various tasks, which achieves the promising EEG classification performance of average accuracy of 80.67% in BCI IV 2a, 88.64% in BCI IV 2b, and 96.65% in SEED, respectively. Extensive ablation experiments conducted between the Dual-TSST and comparative baseline model also reveal the enhanced decoding performance with each module of our proposed method. This study provides a new approach to high-performance EEG decoding, and has great potential for future CNN-Transformer based applications.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, a novel diffusion model guided by spatial features and generates realistic cell layouts has been proposed. We explore different density models as spatial features for the diffusion model. In downstream tasks, we show that the generated cell layouts can be used to guide the generation of high-quality pathology images.

Spatial transcriptomics offers unprecedented insights for the detection of disease-specific genes by enabling within-tissue contrasts. However, this new technology poses challenges for conventional statistical models developed for RNA-sequencing, as these models often neglect the spatial organization of tissue spots. In this article, we propose a Bayesian shrinkage model to characterize the relationship between high-dimensional gene expressions and the disease status of each tissue spot, incorporating spatial correlation among these spots through autoregressive terms. Our model adopts a hierarchical structure to facilitate the analysis of multiple correlated samples and is further extended to accommodate the missing data within tissues. To ensure the model's applicability to datasets of varying sizes, we carry out two computational frameworks for Bayesian parameter estimation, tailored to both small and large sample scenarios. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The proposed model is applied to analyze the data arising from a HER2-positive breast cancer study.</p></details> | 23 Pages |

We introduce spatial dependency through the stick-breaking representation of the original Indian buffet process (IBP) and latent Gaussian process for the logit-transformed breaking proportion to capture underlying spatial correlation. We show that the marginal limiting properties of the number of non-zero entries under SIBP are the same as those in the original IBP, while the joint probability is affected by the spatial correlation. Using binomial expansion and Polya-gamma data augmentation, we provide a novel Gibbs sampling algorithm for posterior computation. The usefulness of the SIBP is demonstrated through simulation studies and two applications for large-dimensional multinomial data of areal dialects and geographical distribution of multiple tree species.</p></details> | 32 pages |

At the receiving end, we present three detectors, i.e., maximum likelihood (ML) detector, two-stage ML detection, and greedy detector to recover the transmitted signal. By utilizing the ML detector, we initially derive the conditional pair error probability expression for the proposed scheme. Subsequently, we leverage the central limit theorem (CLT) to obtain the probability density function of the combined channel. Following this, the Gaussian-Chebyshev quadrature method is applied to derive a closed-form expression for the unconditional pair error probability and establish the union tight upper bound for the average bit error probability (ABEP). Furthermore, we derive a closed-form expression for the ergodic capacity of the proposed RIS-SM scheme. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted not only to assess the complexity and reliability of the three detection algorithms but also to validate the results obtained through theoretical derivation results.</p></details> |  |

The main challenge lies in the high degree of similarity between camouflaged objects and their surroundings in the spatial domain, making identification difficult. Existing methods attempt to reduce the impact of pixel similarity by maximizing the distinguishing ability of spatial features with complicated design, but often ignore the sensitivity and locality of features in the spatial domain, leading to sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose a new approach to address this issue by jointly exploring the representation in the frequency and spatial domains, introducing the Frequency-Spatial Entanglement Learning (FSEL) method. This method consists of a series of well-designed Entanglement Transformer Blocks (ETB) for representation learning, a Joint Domain Perception Module for semantic enhancement, and a Dual-domain Reverse Parser for feature integration in the frequency and spatial domains. Specifically, the ETB utilizes frequency self-attention to effectively characterize the relationship between different frequency bands, while the entanglement feed-forward network facilitates information interaction between features of different domains through entanglement learning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our FSEL over 21 state-of-the-art methods, through comprehensive quantitative and qualitative comparisons in three widely-used datasets.

Current MOT trackers rely on accurate object detection results and precise matching of target reidentification (ReID). These methods focus on optimizing target spatial attributes while overlooking temporal cues in modelling object relationships, especially for challenging tracking conditions such as object deformation and blurring, etc. To address the above-mentioned issues, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Cohesion Multiple Object Tracking framework (STCMOT), which utilizes historical embedding features to model the representation of ReID and detection features in a sequential order. Concretely, a temporal embedding boosting module is introduced to enhance the discriminability of individual embedding based on adjacent frame cooperation. While the trajectory embedding is then propagated by a temporal detection refinement module to mine salient target locations in the temporal field. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone2019 and UAVDT datasets demonstrate our STCMOT sets a new state-of-the-art performance in MOTA and IDF1 metrics. The source codes are released at https://github.com/ydhcg-BoBo/STCMOT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal-Network Point Processes for Modeling Crime Events with Landmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10882v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-exciting point processes are widely used to model the contagious effects of crime events living within continuous geographic space, using their occurrence time and locations. However, in urban environments, most events are naturally constrained within the city's street network structure, and the contagious effects of crime are governed by such a network geography. Meanwhile, the complex distribution of urban infrastructures also plays an important role in shaping crime patterns across space. We introduce a novel spatio-temporal-network point process framework for crime modeling that integrates these urban environmental characteristics by incorporating self-attention graph neural networks. Our framework incorporates the street network structure as the underlying event space, where crime events can occur at random locations on the network edges. To realistically capture criminal movement patterns, distances between events are measured using street network distances. We then propose a new mark for a crime event by concatenating the event's crime category with the type of its nearby landmark, aiming to capture how the urban design influences the mixing structures of various crime types. A graph attention network architecture is adopted to learn the existence of mark-to-mark interactions. Extensive experiments on crime data from Valencia, Spain, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in understanding the crime landscape and forecasting crime risks across regions.</p></details> |  |

While limiting the variety of training data can make training easier, it can also lead to a lack of knowledge and information for the model, resulting in a decrease in performance. To address this challenge, we presented an innovative paradigm that incorporates three separate forms of curriculum learning specifically targeting from spatial, temporal, and quantile perspectives. Furthermore, our framework incorporates a stacking fusion module to combine diverse information from three types of curriculum learning, resulting in a strong and thorough learning process. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this framework with extensive empirical evaluations, highlighting its better performance in addressing complex ST challenges. We provided thorough ablation studies to investigate the effectiveness of our curriculum and to explain how it contributes to the improvement of learning efficiency on ST data.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accept by sigspatial 2024</p></details> |

Current state-of-the-art methods either require multiple independent stages of processing that employ motion cues or, in the case of end-to-end trainable networks, lack in segmentation accuracy, in part due to the difficulty of learning segmentation maps from videos with transient object presence. This limits the application of WSVOS for semantic annotation of surgical videos where multiple surgical tools frequently move in and out of the field of view, a problem that is more difficult than typically encountered in WSVOS. This paper introduces Video Spatio-Temporal Disentanglement Networks (VDST-Net), a framework to disentangle spatiotemporal information using semi-decoupled knowledge distillation to predict high-quality class activation maps (CAMs). A teacher network designed to resolve temporal conflicts when specifics about object location and timing in the video are not provided works with a student network that integrates information over time by leveraging temporal dependencies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on a public reference dataset and on a more challenging surgical video dataset where objects are, on average, present in less than 60\% of annotated frames. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and generates superior segmentation masks under video-level weak supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

From the given task graph, we provide an algorithmic approach to define a distributed sampled-data controller prioritizing the fulfilment of collaborative tasks as the primary objective, while fulfilling independent tasks unless they conflict with collaborative ones. Moreover, communication maintenance among collaborating agents is seamlessly enforced within the proposed control framework.

However, scalability and generalization challenges remain significant obstacles. Advanced models often rely on Graph Neural Networks to encode spatial and temporal correlations, but struggle with the increased complexity of large-scale datasets. The recursive GNN-based message passing schemes used in these models hinder their training and deployment in real-life urban sensing scenarios. Moreover, long-spanning large-scale spatio-temporal data introduce distribution shifts, necessitating improved generalization performance. To address these challenges, we propose a simple framework for spatio-temporal prediction - EasyST paradigm. It learns lightweight and robust Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) by effectively distilling knowledge from complex spatio-temporal GNNs. We ensure robust knowledge distillation by integrating the spatio-temporal information bottleneck with teacher-bounded regression loss, filtering out task-irrelevant noise and avoiding erroneous guidance. We further enhance the generalization ability of the student model by incorporating spatial and temporal prompts to provide downstream task contexts. Evaluation on three spatio-temporal datasets for urban computing tasks demonstrates that EasyST surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in terms of efficiency and accuracy. The implementation code is available at: https://github.com/HKUDS/EasyST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM'2024, full paper</p></details> |
| **[A general reduced-order neural operator for spatio-temporal predictive learning on complex spatial domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05508v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive learning for spatio-temporal processes (PL-STP) on complex spatial domains plays a critical role in various scientific and engineering fields, with its essence being the construction of operators between infinite-dimensional function spaces. This paper focuses on the unequal-domain mappings in PL-STP and categorising them into increase-domain and decrease-domain mapping. Recent advances in deep learning have revealed the great potential of neural operators (NOs) to learn operators directly from observational data. However, existing NOs require input space and output space to be the same domain, which pose challenges in ensuring predictive accuracy and stability for unequal-domain mappings. To this end, this study presents a general reduced-order neural operator named Reduced-Order Neural Operator on Riemannian Manifolds (RO-NORM), which consists of two parts: the unequal-domain encoder/decoder and the same-domain approximator. Motivated by the variable separation in classical modal decomposition, the unequal-domain encoder/decoder uses the pre-computed bases to reformulate the spatio-temporal function as a sum of products between spatial (or temporal) bases and corresponding temporally (or spatially) distributed weight functions, thus the original unequal-domain mapping can be converted into a same-domain mapping. Consequently, the same-domain approximator NORM is applied to model the transformed mapping. The performance of our proposed method has been evaluated on six benchmark cases, including parametric PDEs, engineering and biomedical applications, and compared with four baseline algorithms: DeepONet, POD-DeepONet, PCA-Net, and vanilla NORM. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of RO-NORM in prediction accuracy and training efficiency for PL-STP.</p></details> |  |

However, low accuracy in student classroom behavior detection is a prevalent issue. To address this issue, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Attention-Based Method for Detecting Student Classroom Behaviors (BDSTA). Firstly, the SlowFast network is used to generate motion and environmental information feature maps from the video. Then, the spatio-temporal attention module is applied to the feature maps, including information aggregation, compression and stimulation processes. Subsequently, attention maps in the time, channel and space dimensions are obtained, and multi-label behavior classification is performed based on these attention maps. To solve the long-tail data problem that exists in student classroom behavior datasets, we use an improved focal loss function to assign more weight to the tail class data during training. Experimental results are conducted on a self-made student classroom behavior dataset named STSCB. Compared with the SlowFast model, the average accuracy of student behavior classification detection improves by 8.94\% using BDSTA.</p></details> |  |

However, the lack of publicly available spatio-temporal datasets on student behavior, as well as the high cost of manually labeling such datasets, pose significant challenges for researchers in this field. To address this issue, we proposed a method for extending the spatio-temporal behavior dataset in Student Classroom Scenarios (SCB-ST-Dataset4) through image dataset. Our SCB-ST-Dataset4 comprises 757265 images with 25810 labels, focusing on 3 behaviors: hand-raising, reading, writing. Our proposed method can rapidly generate spatio-temporal behavior datasets without requiring extra manual labeling. Furthermore, we proposed a Behavior Similarity Index (BSI) to explore the similarity of behaviors. We evaluated the dataset using the YOLOv5, YOLOv7, YOLOv8, and SlowFast algorithms, achieving a mean average precision (map) of up to 82.3%. Last, we fused multiple models to generate student behavior-related data from various perspectives. The experiment further demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. And SCB-ST-Dataset4 provides a robust foundation for future research in student behavior detection, potentially contributing to advancements in this field.

Developing techniques to identify and analyze communities in these time-varying graph structures is an important challenge. In this work, we generalize existing spectral clustering algorithms from static to dynamic graphs using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to capture the temporal evolution of clusters. Based on this extended canonical correlation framework, we define the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian and investigate its spectral properties. We connect these concepts to dynamical systems theory via transfer operators, and illustrate the advantages of our method on benchmark graphs by comparison with existing methods. We show that the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian allows for a clear interpretation of cluster structure evolution over time for directed and undirected graphs.</p></details> |  |

A critical component of disease behavior is the velocity with which disease spreads, defined as the rate of change between time and space. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal modeling approach to determine the velocities of infectious disease spread. Our approach assumes that the locations and times of people infected can be considered as a spatio-temporal point pattern that arises as a realization of a spatio-temporal log-Gaussian Cox process. The intensity of this process is estimated using fast Bayesian inference by employing the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) and the Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE) approaches. The velocity is then calculated using finite differences that approximate the derivatives of the intensity function. Finally, the directions and magnitudes of the velocities can be mapped at specific times to examine better the spread of the disease throughout the region. We demonstrate our method by analyzing COVID-19 spread in Cali, Colombia, during the 2020-2021 pandemic.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 46 figures, Journal American Statistican, submitted on 3rd of September</p></details> |

A video tutorial for this library is available on YouTube. We consider two types of methods to estimate a non-homogeneous Poisson process in space and time. The methods approximate the arrival intensity function of the Poisson process by discretizing space and time, and estimating arrival intensity as a function of subregion and time interval. With such methods, it is typical that the dimension of the estimator is large relative to the amount of data, and therefore the performance of the estimator can be improved by using additional data. The first method uses additional data to add a regularization term to the likelihood function for calibrating the intensity of the Poisson process. The second method uses additional data to estimate arrival intensity as a function of covariates. We describe a Python package to perform various types of space and time discretization. We also describe two packages for the calibration of the models, one in Matlab and one in C++. We demonstrate the advantages of our methods compared to basic maximum likelihood estimation with simulated and real data. The experiments with real data calibrate models of the arrival process of emergencies to be handled by the Rio de Janeiro emergency medical service.</p></details> |  |
| **[STAA: Spatio-Temporal Alignment Attention for Short-Term Precipitation Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06732v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a great need to accurately predict short-term precipitation, which has socioeconomic effects such as agriculture and disaster prevention. Recently, the forecasting models have employed multi-source data as the multi-modality input, thus improving the prediction accuracy. However, the prevailing methods usually suffer from the desynchronization of multi-source variables, the insufficient capability of capturing spatio-temporal dependency, and unsatisfactory performance in predicting extreme precipitation events. To fix these problems, we propose a short-term precipitation forecasting model based on spatio-temporal alignment attention, with SATA as the temporal alignment module and STAU as the spatio-temporal feature extractor to filter high-pass features from precipitation signals and capture multi-term temporal dependencies. Based on satellite and ERA5 data from the southwestern region of China, our model achieves improvements of 12.61\% in terms of RMSE, in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

If these components are found, they can be modelled univariately. Blind source separation aims to recover the latent components by estimating the unmixing transformation based on the observed data only. The current methods for spatio-temporal blind source separation are restricted to linear unmixing, and nonlinear variants have not been implemented. In this paper, we extend identifiable variational autoencoder to the nonlinear nonstationary spatio-temporal blind source separation setting and demonstrate its performance using comprehensive simulation studies. Additionally, we introduce two alternative methods for the latent dimension estimation, which is a crucial task in order to obtain the correct latent representation. Finally, we illustrate the proposed methods using a meteorological application, where we estimate the latent dimension and the latent components, interpret the components, and show how nonstationarity can be accounted and prediction accuracy can be improved by using the proposed nonlinear blind source separation method as a preprocessing method.</p></details> |  |

Designing spatio-temporal forecasting models separately in a task-wise and city-wise manner to forecast demand and supply-demand gap in a ride-hailing system poses a burden for the expanding transportation network companies. Therefore, a multi-task learning architecture is proposed in this study by developing gated ensemble of spatio-temporal mixture of experts network (GESME-Net) with convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and recurrent neural network (RNN) for simultaneously forecasting these spatio-temporal tasks in a city as well as across different cities. Furthermore, a task adaptation layer is integrated with the architecture for learning joint representation in multi-task learning and revealing the contribution of the input features utilized in prediction. The proposed architecture is tested with data from Didi Chuxing for: (i) simultaneously forecasting demand and supply-demand gap in Beijing, and (ii) simultaneously forecasting demand across Chengdu and Xian. In both scenarios, models from our proposed architecture outperformed the single-task and multi-task deep learning benchmarks and ensemble-based machine learning algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2012.08868</p></details> |

Although adopting a surrogate gradient (SG) makes the non-differentiability SNN trainable, achieving comparable accuracy for ANNs and keeping low-power features simultaneously is still tricky. In this paper, we proposed an energy-efficient spike-train level spiking neural network with spatio-temporal conversion, which has low computational cost and high accuracy. In the STCSNN, spatio-temporal conversion blocks (STCBs) are proposed to keep the low power features of SNNs and improve accuracy. However, STCSNN cannot adopt backpropagation algorithms directly due to the non-differentiability nature of spike trains. We proposed a suitable learning rule for STCSNNs by deducing the equivalent gradient of STCB. We evaluate the proposed STCSNN on static and neuromorphic datasets, including Fashion-Mnist, Cifar10, Cifar100, TinyImageNet, and DVS-Cifar10. The experiment results show that our proposed STCSNN outperforms the state-of-the-art accuracy on nearly all datasets, using fewer time steps and being highly energy-efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neurocomputing on 10 August 2024</p></details> |

It consists of a pyramid structure with a spatial information reuse strategy, a sequential pose initialization module, a gated hierarchical pose refinement module, and a temporal feature propagation module. First, spatial features are encoded using a point feature pyramid, with features reused in successive pose estimations to reduce computational overhead. Second, a sequential pose initialization method is introduced, leveraging the high-frequency sampling characteristic of LiDAR to initialize the LiDAR pose. Then, a gated hierarchical pose refinement mechanism refines poses from coarse to fine by selectively retaining or discarding motion information from different layers based on gate estimations. Finally, temporal feature propagation is proposed to incorporate the historical motion information from point cloud sequences, and address the spatial inconsistency issue when transmitting motion information embedded in point clouds between frames. Experimental results on the KITTI odometry dataset and Argoverse dataset demonstrate that DSLO outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving at least a 15.67\% improvement on RTE and a 12.64\% improvement on RRE, while also achieving a 34.69\% reduction in runtime compared to baseline methods. Our implementation will be available at https://github.com/IRMVLab/DSLO.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, accepted by IROS 2024</p></details> |

However, existing methods encounter difficulties when applied to problems on unstructured grids and irregular domains. Spatial graph neural networks utilize local convolution in a neighborhood to potentially address these challenges, yet they often suffer from issues such as over-smoothing and over-squashing in deep architectures. Conversely, spectral graph neural networks leverage global convolution to capture extensive features and long-range dependencies in domain graphs, albeit at a high computational cost due to Eigenvalue decomposition. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, referred to as Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Operator (Sp$^2$GNO) that integrates spatial and spectral GNNs effectively. This framework mitigates the limitations of individual methods and enables the learning of solution operators across arbitrary geometries, thus catering to a wide range of real-world problems. Sp$^2$GNO demonstrates exceptional performance in solving both time-dependent and time-independent partial differential equations on regular and irregular domains. Our approach is validated through comprehensive benchmarks and practical applications drawn from computational mechanics and scientific computing literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mending of Spatio-Temporal Dependencies in Block Adjacency Matrix](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02606v2)** | 2024-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of applications where data dynamically evolves across spatial and temporal dimensions, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are often complemented by sequence modeling architectures, such as RNNs and transformers, to effectively model temporal changes. These hybrid models typically arrange the spatial and temporal learning components in series. A pioneering effort to jointly model the spatio-temporal dependencies using only GNNs was the introduction of the Block Adjacency Matrix \(\mathbf{A_B}\) \cite{1}, which was constructed by diagonally concatenating adjacency matrices from graphs at different time steps. This approach resulted in a single graph encompassing complete spatio-temporal data; however, the graphs from different time steps remained disconnected, limiting GNN message-passing to spatially connected nodes only. Addressing this critical challenge, we propose a novel end-to-end learning architecture specifically designed to mend the temporal dependencies, resulting in a well-connected graph. Thus, we provide a framework for the learnable representation of spatio-temporal data as graphs. Our methodology demonstrates superior performance on benchmark datasets, such as SurgVisDom and C2D2, surpassing existing state-of-the-art graph models in terms of accuracy. Our model also achieves significantly lower computational complexity, having far fewer parameters than methods reliant on CLIP and 3D CNN architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICONIP 2024</p></details> |

However, these networks often face challenges in training due to the high annotation cost. To address this, unsupervised and weakly-supervised methods have been developed to reduce the dependency on annotations. This work introduces a novel weakly-supervised method called Eigen-cluster VIS that, without requiring any mask annotations, achieves competitive accuracy compared to other VIS approaches. This method is based on two key innovations: a Temporal Eigenvalue Loss (TEL) and a clip-level Quality Cluster Coefficient (QCC). The TEL ensures temporal coherence by leveraging the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix derived from graph adjacency matrices. By minimizing the mean absolute error (MAE) between the eigenvalues of adjacent frames, this loss function promotes smooth transitions and stable segmentation boundaries over time, reducing temporal discontinuities and improving overall segmentation quality. The QCC employs the K-means method to ensure the quality of spatio-temporal clusters without relying on ground truth masks. Using the Davies-Bouldin score, the QCC provides an unsupervised measure of feature discrimination, allowing the model to self-evaluate and adapt to varying object distributions, enhancing robustness during the testing phase. These enhancements are computationally efficient and straightforward, offering significant performance gains without additional annotated data. The proposed Eigen-Cluster VIS method is evaluated on the YouTube-VIS 2019/2021 and OVIS datasets, demonstrating that it effectively narrows the performance gap between the fully-supervised and weakly-supervised VIS approaches.

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at modeling and forecasting spatio-temporal data, they often lack the ability to directly incorporate underlying physical laws. This work presents TG-PhyNN, a novel Temporal Graph Physics-Informed Neural Network framework. TG-PhyNN leverages the power of GNNs for graph-based modeling while simultaneously incorporating physical constraints as a guiding principle during training. This is achieved through a two-step prediction strategy that enables the calculation of physical equation derivatives within the GNN architecture. Our findings demonstrate that TG-PhyNN significantly outperforms traditional forecasting models (e.g., GRU, LSTM, GAT) on real-world spatio-temporal datasets like PedalMe (traffic flow), COVID-19 spread, and Chickenpox outbreaks. These datasets are all governed by well-defined physical principles, which TG-PhyNN effectively exploits to offer more reliable and accurate forecasts in various domains where physical processes govern the dynamics of data. This paves the way for improved forecasting in areas like traffic flow prediction, disease outbreak prediction, and potentially other fields where physics plays a crucial role.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Context Prompting for Zero-Shot Action Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15996v2)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal action detection encompasses the tasks of localizing and classifying individual actions within a video. Recent works aim to enhance this process by incorporating interaction modeling, which captures the relationship between people and their surrounding context. However, these approaches have primarily focused on fully-supervised learning, and the current limitation lies in the lack of generalization capability to recognize unseen action categories. In this paper, we aim to adapt the pretrained image-language models to detect unseen actions. To this end, we propose a method which can effectively leverage the rich knowledge of visual-language models to perform Person-Context Interaction. Meanwhile, our Context Prompting module will utilize contextual information to prompt labels, thereby enhancing the generation of more representative text features. Moreover, to address the challenge of recognizing distinct actions by multiple people at the same timestamp, we design the Interest Token Spotting mechanism which employs pretrained visual knowledge to find each person's interest context tokens, and then these tokens will be used for prompting to generate text features tailored to each individual. To evaluate the ability to detect unseen actions, we propose a comprehensive benchmark on J-HMDB, UCF101-24, and AVA datasets. The experiments show that our method achieves superior results compared to previous approaches and can be further extended to multi-action videos, bringing it closer to real-world applications.

A reason for this is that learning on dynamic graph data is becoming more relevant, since data from many scientific fields, ranging from mathematics, biology, social sciences, and physics to computer science, is naturally related and inherently dynamic. In addition, TPPs provide a meaningful characterization of event streams and a prediction mechanism for future events. Therefore, (semi-)parameterized Neural TPPs have been introduced whose characterization can be (partially) learned and, thus, enable the representation of more complex phenomena. However, the research on modeling dynamic graphs with TPPs is relatively young, and only a few models for node attribute changes or evolving edges have been proposed yet. To allow for learning on fully dynamic graph streams, i.e., graphs that can change in their structure (addition/deletion of nodes/edge) and in their node/edge attributes, we propose a Marked Neural Spatio-Temporal Point Process (MNSTPP). It leverages a Dynamic Graph Neural Network to learn a Marked TPP that handles attributes and spatial data to model and predict any event in a graph stream.</p></details> |  |

Human-centric VAD, a specialized area within this domain, faces additional complexities, including variations in human behavior, potential biases in data, and substantial privacy concerns related to human subjects. These issues complicate the development of models that are both robust and generalizable. To address these challenges, recent advancements have focused on pose-based VAD, which leverages human pose as a high-level feature to mitigate privacy concerns, reduce appearance biases, and minimize background interference. In this paper, we introduce PoseWatch, a novel transformer-based architecture designed specifically for human-centric pose-based VAD. PoseWatch features an innovative Spatio-Temporal Pose and Relative Pose (ST-PRP) tokenization method that enhances the representation of human motion over time, which is also beneficial for broader human behavior analysis tasks. The architecture's core, a Unified Encoder Twin Decoders (UETD) transformer, significantly improves the detection of anomalous behaviors in video data. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PoseWatch consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in pose-based VAD. This work not only demonstrates the efficacy of PoseWatch but also highlights the potential of integrating Natural Language Processing techniques with computer vision to advance human behavior analysis.</p></details> |  |

Traditional forecasting methods, however, struggle with the irregular traffic time series resulting from adaptive traffic signal controls, presenting challenges in asynchronous spatial dependency, irregular temporal dependency, and predicting variable-length sequences. To this end, we propose an Asynchronous Spatio-tEmporal graph convolutional nEtwoRk (ASeer) tailored for irregular traffic time series forecasting. Specifically, we first propose an Asynchronous Graph Diffusion Network to capture the spatial dependency between asynchronously measured traffic states regulated by adaptive traffic signals. After that, to capture the temporal dependency within irregular traffic state sequences, a personalized time encoding is devised to embed the continuous time signals. Then, we propose a Transformable Time-aware Convolution Network, which adapts meta-filters for time-aware convolution on the sequences with inconsistent temporal flow. Additionally, a Semi-Autoregressive Prediction Network, comprising a state evolution unit and a semi-autoregressive predictor, is designed to predict variable-length traffic sequences effectively and efficiently. Extensive experiments on a newly established benchmark demonstrate the superiority of ASeer compared with twelve competitive baselines across six metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is published in the research track of KDD 2024</p></details> |

The associated challenges are exacerbated when solutions to these interconnected problems need to simultaneously maximize task performance and respect practical constraints on time and resources. In this work, we formulate a new class of spatio-temporal heterogeneous task allocation problems that formalize these complexities. We then contribute a novel framework, named Quality-Optimized Incremental Task Allocation Graph Search (Q-ITAGS), to solve such problems. Q-ITAGS offers a flexible interleaved framework that i) explicitly models and optimizes the effect of collective capabilities on task performance via learnable trait-quality maps, and ii) respects both resource and spatio-temporal constraints, including a user-specified time budget (i.e., maximum makespan). In addition to algorithmic contributions, we derive theoretical suboptimality bounds in terms of task performance that varies as a function of a single hyperparameter. Detailed experiments involving a simulated emergency response task and a real-world video game dataset reveal that i) Q-ITAGS results in superior team performance compared to a state-of-the-art method, while also respecting complex spatio-temporal and resource constraints, ii) Q-ITAGS efficiently learns trait-quality maps to enable effective trade-off between task performance and resource constraints, and iii) Q-ITAGS' suboptimality bounds consistently hold in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.13092</p></details> |

Although various neural networks with intricate architectures have been developed to address this problem, they still face two key challenges: i) Recent advancements in network designs for modeling spatio-temporal correlations are starting to see diminishing returns in performance enhancements. ii) Additionally, most models do not account for the spatio-temporal heterogeneity inherent in traffic data, i.e., traffic distribution varies significantly across different regions and traffic flow patterns fluctuate across various time slots. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer (STGormer), which effectively integrates attribute and structure information inherent in traffic data for learning spatio-temporal correlations, and a mixture-of-experts module for capturing heterogeneity along spaital and temporal axes. Specifically, we design two straightforward yet effective spatial encoding methods based on the graph structure and integrate time position encoding into the vanilla transformer to capture spatio-temporal traffic patterns. Additionally, a mixture-of-experts enhanced feedforward neural network (FNN) module adaptively assigns suitable expert layers to distinct patterns via a spatio-temporal gating network, further improving overall prediction accuracy. Experiments on real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that STGormer achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

The recent advancements in Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have inspired efforts to reprogram these models for time series forecasting tasks, by leveraging their superior reasoning and generalization capabilities. However, existing approaches fall short in handling complex spatial inter-series dependencies and intrinsic intra-series frequency components, limiting their spatio-temporal forecasting performance. Moreover, the linear mapping of continuous time series to a compressed subset vocabulary in reprogramming constrains the spatio-temporal semantic expressivity of PLMs and may lead to potential information bottleneck. To overcome the above limitations, we propose \textsc{RePST}, a tailored PLM reprogramming framework for spatio-temporal forecasting. The key insight of \textsc{RePST} is to decouple the spatio-temporal dynamics in the frequency domain, allowing better alignment with the PLM text space. Specifically, we first decouple spatio-temporal data in Fourier space and devise a structural diffusion operator to obtain temporal intrinsic and spatial diffusion signals, making the dynamics more comprehensible and predictable for PLMs. To avoid information bottleneck from a limited vocabulary, we further propose a discrete reprogramming strategy that selects relevant discrete textual information from an expanded vocabulary space in a differentiable manner. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art spatio-temporal forecasting models, particularly in data-scarce scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we focus on an instance of spatio-temporal learning problem--traffic prediction--to demonstrate an advanced deep learning model developed for making accurate and reliable forecast. Despite the significant progress in traffic prediction, limited studies have incorporated both explicit and implicit traffic patterns simultaneously to improve prediction performance. Meanwhile, the variability nature of traffic states necessitates quantifying the uncertainty of model predictions in a statistically principled way; however, extant studies offer no provable guarantee on the statistical validity of confidence intervals in reflecting its actual likelihood of containing the ground truth. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end traffic prediction framework that leverages three primary components to generate accurate and reliable traffic predictions: dynamic causal structure learning for discovering implicit traffic patterns from massive traffic data, causally-aware spatio-temporal multi-graph convolution network (CASTMGCN) for learning spatio-temporal dependencies, and conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification. CASTMGCN fuses several graphs that characterize different important aspects of traffic networks and an auxiliary graph that captures the effect of exogenous factors on the road network. On this basis, a conformal prediction approach tailored to spatio-temporal data is further developed for quantifying the uncertainty in node-wise traffic predictions over varying prediction horizons. Experimental results on two real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art models in prediction accuracy; moreover, it generates more efficient prediction regions than other methods while strictly satisfying the statistical validity in coverage.</p></details> |  |

However, the existing road-level traffic prediction has mainly studied how significantly micro traffic events propagate to the adjacent roads in terms of short-term prediction. On the other hand, recent attempts have been made to incorporate regional knowledge such as POIs, road characteristics, and real-time social events to help traffic prediction. However, these studies lack in understandings of different modalities of road-level and region-level spatio-temporal correlations and how to combine such knowledge. This paper proposes a novel method that embeds real-time region-level knowledge using POIs, satellite images, and real-time LTE access traces via a regional spatio-temporal module that consists of dynamic convolution and temporal attention, and conducts bipartite spatial transform attention to convert into road-level knowledge. Then the model ingests this embedded knowledge into a road-level attention-based prediction model. Experimental results on real-world road traffic prediction show that our model outperforms the baselines.</p></details> |  |

This discrepancy arises primarily from the high costs associated with the input of existing representation models, which often require street views and mobility data. To address this, we develop a novel, training-free method that leverages large language models (LLMs) and auxiliary map data from OpenStreetMap to derive geolocation representations (LLMGeovec). LLMGeovec can represent the geographic semantics of city, country, and global scales, which acts as a generic enhancer for spatio-temporal learning. Specifically, by direct feature concatenation, we introduce a simple yet effective paradigm for enhancing multiple spatio-temporal tasks including geographic prediction (GP), long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), and graph-based spatio-temporal forecasting (GSTF). LLMGeovec can seamlessly integrate into a wide spectrum of spatio-temporal learning models, providing immediate enhancements. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMGeovec achieves global coverage and significantly boosts the performance of leading GP, LTSF, and GSTF models.</p></details> |  |

Thus, large amounts of video samples are continuously required for traditional data-driven training. However, samples are not always sufficient in real-world scenarios, promoting few-shot action recognition (FSAR) research. We observe that most recent FSAR works build spatio-temporal relation of video samples via temporal alignment after spatial feature extraction, cutting apart spatial and temporal features within samples. They also capture motion information via narrow perspectives between adjacent frames without considering density, leading to insufficient motion information capturing. Therefore, we propose a novel plug-and-play architecture for FSAR called Spatio-tempOral frAme tuPle enhancer (SOAP) in this paper. The model we designed with such architecture refers to SOAP-Net. Temporal connections between different feature channels and spatio-temporal relation of features are considered instead of simple feature extraction. Comprehensive motion information is also captured, using frame tuples with multiple frames containing more motion information than adjacent frames. Combining frame tuples of diverse frame counts further provides a broader perspective. SOAP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance across well-known benchmarks such as SthSthV2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51. Extensive empirical evaluations underscore the competitiveness, pluggability, generalization, and robustness of SOAP.

The color, shape, and location of moire patterns may differ across video frames, posing a challenge in learning information from adjacent frames and preserving temporal consistency. Previous video demoireing methods heavily rely on well-designed alignment modules, resulting in substantial computational burdens. Recently, Mamba, an improved version of the State Space Model (SSM), has demonstrated significant potential for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, enabling efficient temporal modeling in video demoireing without requiring a specific alignment module. In this paper, we propose a novel alignment-free Raw video demoireing network with frequency-assisted spatio-temporal Mamba (DemMamba). The Spatial Mamba Block (SMB) and Temporal Mamba Block (TMB) are sequentially arranged to facilitate effective intra- and inter-relationship modeling in Raw videos with moire patterns. Within SMB, an Adaptive Frequency Block (AFB) is introduced to aid demoireing in the frequency domain. For TMB, a Channel Attention Block (CAB) is embedded to further enhance temporal information interactions by exploiting the inter-channel relationships among features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DemMamba surpasses state-of-the-art approaches by 1.3 dB and delivers a superior visual experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-temporal Prediction Methodology Based on Deep Learning and Real Wi-Fi Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09423v1)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of Wi-Fi technologies in recent years has caused a significant increase in the traffic usage. Hence, knowledge obtained from Wi-Fi network measurements can be helpful for a more efficient network management. In this paper, we propose a methodology to predict future values of some specific network metrics (e.g. traffic load, transmission failures, etc.). These predictions may be useful for improving the network performance. After data collection and preprocessing, the correlation between each target access point (AP) and its neighbouring APs is estimated. According to these correlations, either an only-temporal or a spatio-temporal based prediction is done. To evaluate the proposed methodology, real measurements are collected from 100 APs deployed in different university buildings for 3 months. Deep Learning (DL) methods (i.e. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Simple Recurrent Neural Network (SRNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Transformer) are evaluated and compared for both temporal and spatio-temporal based predictions. Moreover, a hybrid prediction methodology is proposed using a spatial processing based on CNN and a temporal prediction based on RNN. The proposed hybrid methodology provides an improvement in the prediction accuracy at expenses of a slight increase in the Training Computational Time (TCT) and negligible in Prediction Computational Time (PCT).</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Temporal Reversed Training for Spiking Neural Networks with Generalized Spatio-Temporal Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09108v1)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention as an ultra-low energy computing paradigm. Recent studies have focused on improving the feature extraction capability of SNNs, but they suffer from inefficient inference and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective temporal reversed training (TRT) method to optimize the spatio-temporal performance of SNNs and circumvent these problems. We perturb the input temporal data by temporal reversal, prompting the SNN to produce original-reversed consistent output logits and to learn perturbation-invariant representations. For static data without temporal dimension, we generalize this strategy by exploiting the inherent temporal property of spiking neurons for spike feature temporal reversal. In addition, we utilize the lightweight ``star operation" (element-wise multiplication) to hybridize the original and temporally reversed spike firing rates and expand the implicit dimensions, which serves as spatio-temporal regularization to further enhance the generalization of the SNN. Our method involves only an additional temporal reversal operation and element-wise multiplication during training, thus incurring negligible training overhead and not affecting the inference efficiency at all. Extensive experiments on static/neuromorphic object/action recognition, and 3D point cloud classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method. In particular, with only two timesteps, our method achieves 74.77\% and 90.57\% accuracy on ImageNet and ModelNet40, respectively.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |

However, existing models often face limitations in generalization, struggling with zero-shot prediction on unseen regions and cities, as well as diminished long-term accuracy. This is primarily due to the inherent challenges in handling the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of traffic data, coupled with the significant distribution shift across time and space. In this work, we aim to unlock new possibilities for building versatile, resilient and adaptive spatio-temporal foundation models for traffic prediction. To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel foundation model, named OpenCity, that can effectively capture and normalize the underlying spatio-temporal patterns from diverse data characteristics, facilitating zero-shot generalization across diverse urban environments. OpenCity integrates the Transformer architecture with graph neural networks to model the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in traffic data. By pre-training OpenCity on large-scale, heterogeneous traffic datasets, we enable the model to learn rich, generalizable representations that can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of traffic forecasting scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that OpenCity exhibits exceptional zero-shot predictive performance. Moreover, OpenCity showcases promising scaling laws, suggesting the potential for developing a truly one-for-all traffic prediction solution that can adapt to new urban contexts with minimal overhead. We made our proposed OpenCity model open-source and it is available at the following link: https://github.com/HKUDS/OpenCity.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) is conducted on TX-123BT daily profiles and numerical results are compared with the actual ERCOT system for validation. The long-term spatio-temporal profiles can greatly capture the renewable production versatility due to the environmental conditions.

The safety risk and urgency of autonomous vehicles in the absence of collision are evaluated. To ensure safety and improve road efficiency, a method of pre-compiling the spatio-temporal trajectory of vehicles is established to eliminate conflicts between vehicles in advance. The calculation method of the safe distance under spatio-temporal conditions is studied, considering vehicle speed differences, vehicle positioning errors, and clock errors. By combining collision acceleration and urgent acceleration, an evaluation model for vehicle conflict risk is constructed. Mainline vehicles that may have conflicts with on-ramp vehicles are identified, and the target gap for on-ramp vehicles is determined. Finally, a cooperative control method is established based on the selected target gap, preparing the vehicle travel path in advance. Taking highway ramp merge as an example, the mainline priority spatio-temporal cooperative control method is proposed and verified through simulation.

| **[System States Forecasting of Microservices with Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07894v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations) era, accurately forecasting system states is crucial. In microservices systems, this task encounters the challenge of dynamic and complex spatio-temporal relationships among microservice instances, primarily due to dynamic deployments, diverse call paths, and cascading effects among instances. Current time-series forecasting methods, which focus mainly on intrinsic patterns, are insufficient in environments where spatial relationships are critical. Similarly, spatio-temporal graph approaches often neglect the nature of temporal trend, concentrating mostly on message passing between nodes. Moreover, current research in microservices domain frequently underestimates the importance of network metrics and topological structures in capturing the evolving dynamics of systems. This paper introduces STMformer, a model tailored for forecasting system states in microservices environments, capable of handling multi-node and multivariate time series. Our method leverages dynamic network connection data and topological information to assist in modeling the intricate spatio-temporal relationships within the system. Additionally, we integrate the PatchCrossAttention module to compute the impact of cascading effects globally. We have developed a dataset based on a microservices system and conducted comprehensive experiments with STMformer against leading methods. In both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks, our model consistently achieved a 8.6% reduction in MAE(Mean Absolute Error) and a 2.2% reduction in MSE (Mean Squared Error).

Nonetheless, these methods mainly adopt imagepair appearance matching and face challenges of the intrinsic high quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism, resulting in constrained exploitation of temporal information. Inspired by the recently emerged State Space Model Mamba, renowned for its impressive long sequence modeling capabilities and linear computational complexity, this work innovatively proposes a pure Mamba-based framework (MambaVT) to fully exploit spatio-temporal contextual modeling for robust visible-thermal tracking. Specifically, we devise the long-range cross-frame integration component to globally adapt to target appearance variations, and introduce short-term historical trajectory prompts to predict the subsequent target states based on local temporal location clues. Extensive experiments show the significant potential of vision Mamba for RGB-T tracking, with MambaVT achieving state-of-the-art performance on four mainstream benchmarks while requiring lower computational costs. We aim for this work to serve as a simple yet strong baseline, stimulating future research in this field. The code and pre-trained models will be made available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Spatio-Temporal Processing in Spiking Neural Networks through Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07517v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient implementations of spiking neural networks on neuromorphic hardware promise orders of magnitude less power consumption than their non-spiking counterparts. The standard neuron model for spike-based computation on such neuromorphic systems has long been the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron. As a promising advancement, a computationally light augmentation of the LIF neuron model with an adaptation mechanism experienced a recent upswing in popularity, caused by demonstrations of its superior performance on spatio-temporal processing tasks. The root of the superiority of these so-called adaptive LIF neurons however, is not well understood. In this article, we thoroughly analyze the dynamical, computational, and learning properties of adaptive LIF neurons and networks thereof. We find that the frequently observed stability problems during training of such networks can be overcome by applying an alternative discretization method that results in provably better stability properties than the commonly used Euler-Forward method. With this discretization, we achieved a new state-of-the-art performance on common event-based benchmark datasets. We also show that the superiority of networks of adaptive LIF neurons extends to the prediction and generation of complex time series. Our further analysis of the computational properties of networks of adaptive LIF neurons shows that they are particularly well suited to exploit the spatio-temporal structure of input sequences. Furthermore, these networks are surprisingly robust to shifts of the mean input strength and input spike rate, even when these shifts were not observed during training. As a consequence, high-performance networks can be obtained without any normalization techniques such as batch normalization or batch-normalization through time.</p></details> |  |

The weak dependence condition for arrays of random fields is proved to be inherited through transformation and infinite shift. This paves a way to prove the consistency and asymptotic normality of maximum likelihood estimation for dynamic spatio-temporal models (i.e. so-called ultra high-dimensional time series models) when the sample size and/or dimension go to infinity. Especially the asymptotic properties of estimation for network autoregression are obtained under reasonable regularity conditions.</p></details> |  |

This compressor comprehensively considers both temporal and spatial information, encompassing many existing specific compressors. We use the average consensus algorithm as a starting point and further studies distributed optimization algorithms, the Prime-Dual algorithm as an example, in both continuous and discrete time forms. We find that under stronger additional assumptions, the spatio-temporal compressor can be directly applied to distributed computing algorithms, while its default form can also be successfully applied through observer-based differential compression methods, ensuring the linear convergence of the algorithm when the objective function is strongly convex. On this basis, we also discuss the acceleration of the algorithm, filter-based compression methods in the literature, and the addition of randomness to the spatio-temporal compressor. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the generality of the spatio-temporal compressor, compare different compression methods, and verify the algorithm's performance in the convex objective function scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2408.02332</p></details> |
| **[Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection and Localization with Spatio-Temporal Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05905v2)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WSVAD) task aims to achieve frame-level anomalous event detection with only coarse video-level annotations available. Existing works typically involve extracting global features from full-resolution video frames and training frame-level classifiers to detect anomalies in the temporal dimension. However, most anomalous events tend to occur in localized spatial regions rather than the entire video frames, which implies existing frame-level feature based works may be misled by the dominant background information and lack the interpretation of the detected anomalies. To address this dilemma, this paper introduces a novel method called STPrompt that learns spatio-temporal prompt embeddings for weakly supervised video anomaly detection and localization (WSVADL) based on pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). Our proposed method employs a two-stream network structure, with one stream focusing on the temporal dimension and the other primarily on the spatial dimension. By leveraging the learned knowledge from pre-trained VLMs and incorporating natural motion priors from raw videos, our model learns prompt embeddings that are aligned with spatio-temporal regions of videos (e.g., patches of individual frames) for identify specific local regions of anomalies, enabling accurate video anomaly detection while mitigating the influence of background information. Without relying on detailed spatio-temporal annotations or auxiliary object detection/tracking, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks for the WSVADL task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM2024</p></details> |

We benchmark SET against said models on the charged $N$-body problem, a simple physical system with complex dynamics. While existing spatio-temporal graph neural networks focus on sequential modeling, we empirically demonstrate that leveraging underlying domain symmetries yields considerable improvements for modeling dynamical systems on graphs.</p></details> |  |

Considering the spatio-temporal nature of EEG data, one of our frameworks is based on a CNN-BiLSTM model. The other involves a CNN-Transformer architecture which inherently involves the more versatile attention based learning paradigm. In both cases, a special 1D-CNN feature extraction module is used to generate the initial embeddings with 1D convolutions in the time and the EEG channel domains. Considering the EEG signals are noisy, non stationary and the discriminative features are even less clear (than in semantically structured data such as text or image), we also follow a window-based classification followed by majority voting during inference, to yield labels at a signal level. To illustrate how brain patterns correlate with different image classes, we visualize t-SNE plots of the BiLSTM embeddings alongside brain activation maps for the top 10 classes. These visualizations provide insightful revelations into the distinct neural signatures associated with each visual category, showcasing the BiLSTM's capability to capture and represent the discriminative brain activity linked to visual stimuli. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on the updated EEG-Imagenet dataset with positive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been submitted at ICPR 2024.

However, existing transformer-based methods primarily use self-attention mechanisms for spatio-temporal modeling, leading to a quadratic complexity, unidirectional modeling of spatio-temporal relationships, and insufficient learning of spatial-temporal correlations. Recently, the Mamba architecture, utilizing the state space model (SSM), has exhibited superior long-range modeling capabilities in a variety of vision tasks with linear complexity. In this paper, we propose PoseMamba, a novel purely SSM-based approach with linear complexity for 3D human pose estimation in monocular video. Specifically, we propose a bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block that comprehensively models human joint relations within individual frames as well as temporal correlations across frames. Within this bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block, we introduce a reordering strategy to enhance the local modeling capability of the SSM. This strategy provides a more logical geometric scanning order and integrates it with the global SSM, resulting in a combined global-local spatial scan. We have quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated our approach using two benchmark datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoseMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets while maintaining a smaller model size and reducing computational costs. The code and models will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion Models for EEG Super-Resolution in Epilepsy Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03089v3)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, particularly high-density EEG (HD EEG) devices, is widely used in fields such as neuroscience. HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, meeting the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STADMs) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which then serve as conditional inputs to guide the reverse denoising process of diffusion models. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STADMs demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks of epilepsy patients, indicating their potential to significantly improve the spatial resolution of LR EEG.</p></details> |  |

Yet, these models fall short of quantifying future uncertainties. Recently, many probabilistic methods, especially variants of diffusion models, have been proposed to fill this gap. However, existing diffusion methods typically deal with individual sensors separately when generating future time series, resulting in limited usage of spatial information in the probabilistic learning process. In this work, we propose SpecSTG, a novel spectral diffusion framework, to better leverage spatial dependencies and systematic patterns inherent in traffic data. More specifically, our method generates the Fourier representation of future time series, transforming the learning process into the spectral domain enriched with spatial information. Additionally, our approach incorporates a fast spectral graph convolution designed for Fourier input, alleviating the computational burden associated with existing models. Compared with state-of-the-arts, SpecSTG achieves up to 8% improvements on point estimations and up to 0.78% improvements on quantifying future uncertainties. Furthermore, SpecSTG's training and validation speed is 3.33X of the most efficient existing diffusion method for STG forecasting. The source code for SpecSTG is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SpecSTG.</p></details> |  |

However, acquiring high-resolution MRI typically extends scan time, which can introduce motion artifacts. Super-resolution of MRI therefore emerges as a promising approach to mitigate these challenges. Earlier studies have investigated the use of multiple contrasts for MRI super-resolution (MCSR), whereas majority of them did not fully exploit the rich contrast-invariant structural information. To fully utilize such crucial prior knowledge of multi-contrast MRI, in this work, we propose a novel structure-guided MCSR (SGSR) framework based on a new spatio-frequency co-query attention (CQA) mechanism. Specifically, CQA performs attention on features of multiple contrasts with a shared structural query, which is particularly designed to extract, fuse, and refine the common structures from different contrasts. We further propose a novel frequency-domain CQA module in addition to the spatial domain, to enable more fine-grained structural refinement. Extensive experiments on fastMRI knee data and low-field brain MRI show that SGSR outperforms state-of-the-art MCSR methods with statistical significance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 15th International Workshop on Machine Learning in Medical Imaging (MLMI 2024)</p></details> |

The central aim of multi-agent optimization is for a network of agents to collaboratively solve a system-level optimization problem with local objective functions and node-to-node communication by distributed algorithms. The scalability of such algorithms crucially depends on the complexity of the communication messages, and a number of communication compressors for distributed optimization have recently been proposed in the literature. First of all, we introduce a general spatio-temporal compressor characterized by the stability of the resulting dynamical system along the vector field of the compressor. We show that several important distributed optimization compressors such as the greedy sparsifier, the uniform quantizer, and the scalarizer all fall into the category of this spatio-temporal compressor. Next, we propose two distributed prime-dual flows with the spatio-temporal compressors being applied to local node states and local error states, respectively, and prove (exponential) convergence of the node trajectories to the global optimizer for (strongly) convex cost functions. Finally, a few numerical examples are present to illustrate our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |

Most existing studies show satisfying performance under regular scenarios, but most neglected safety-critical scenarios. In this study, a spatio-temporal dual-encoder network named STDA for safety-critical scenarios was developed. Considering the exceptional capabilities of human drivers in terms of situational awareness and comprehending risks, driver attention was incorporated into STDA to facilitate swift identification of the critical regions, which is expected to improve both performance and interpretability. STDA contains four parts: the driver attention prediction module, which predicts driver attention; the fusion module designed to fuse the features between driver attention and raw images; the temporary encoder module used to enhance the capability to interpret dynamic scenes; and the behavior prediction module to predict the behavior. The experiment data are used to train and validate the model. The results show that STDA improves the G-mean from 0.659 to 0.719 when incorporating driver attention and adopting a temporal encoder module. In addition, extensive experimentation has been conducted to validate that the proposed module exhibits robust generalization capabilities and can be seamlessly integrated into other mainstream models.</p></details> |  |

This study, part of the European LAMASUS (Land Management for Sustainability) project, aims to support the EU's climate neutrality target by developing a governance model through collaboration between policymakers, land users, and researchers. We present a methodological synthesis for treating land use data using a Bayesian approach within spatial and spatio-temporal modeling frameworks. The study tackles the challenges of analyzing land use changes, particularly the presence of zero values and computational issues with large datasets. It introduces joint model structures to address zeros and employs sequential inference and consensus methods for Big Data problems. Spatial downscaling models approximate smaller scales from aggregated data, circumventing high-resolution data complications. We explore Beta regression and Compositional Data Analysis (CoDa) for land use data, review relevant spatial and spatio-temporal models, and present strategies for handling zeros. The paper demonstrates the implementation of key models, downscaling techniques, and solutions to Big Data challenges with examples from simulated data and the LAMASUS project, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding and managing land use changes.</p></details> | 29 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Partial Sensing Forecast for Long-term Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02689v1)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting uses recent measurements by sensors installed at chosen locations to forecast the future road traffic. Existing work either assumes all locations are equipped with sensors or focuses on short-term forecast. This paper studies partial sensing traffic forecast of long-term traffic, assuming sensors only at some locations. The study is important in lowering the infrastructure investment cost in traffic management since deploying sensors at all locations could incur prohibitively high cost. However, the problem is challenging due to the unknown distribution at unsensed locations, the intricate spatio-temporal correlation in long-term forecasting, as well as noise in data and irregularities in traffic patterns (e.g., road closure). We propose a Spatio-Temporal Partial Sensing (STPS) forecast model for long-term traffic prediction, with several novel contributions, including a rank-based embedding technique to capture irregularities and overcome noise, a spatial transfer matrix to overcome the spatial distribution shift from permanently sensed locations to unsensed locations, and a multi-step training process that utilizes all available data to successively refine the model parameters for better accuracy. Extensive experiments on several real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that STPS outperforms the state-of-the-art and achieves superior accuracy in partial sensing long-term forecasting.</p></details> |  |

However, their predictive distribution is not generally known. Under this modeling assumption, we define a novel spatio-temporal embedding and a theory-guided machine learning approach that employs a generalized Bayesian algorithm to make ensemble forecasts. We use Lipschitz predictors and determine fixed-time and any-time PAC Bayesian bounds in the batch learning setting. Performing causal forecast is a highlight of our methodology as its potential application to data with spatial and temporal short and long-range dependence. We then test the performance of our learning methodology by using linear predictors and data sets simulated from a spatio-temporal Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</p></details> |  |

But coarse, heterogeneous aggregations complicate learning and integration for downstream AI/ML systems. In this work, we consider models to disaggregate spatio-temporal data from a low-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., census tract) to a high-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., city block). We propose an overarching model named the Structurally-Aware Recurrent Network (SARN), which integrates structurally-aware spatial attention (SASA) layers into the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model. The spatial attention layers capture spatial interactions among regions, while the gated recurrent module captures the temporal dependencies. Each SASA layer calculates both global and structural attention -- global attention facilitates comprehensive interactions between different geographic levels, while structural attention leverages the containment relationship between different geographic levels (e.g., a city block being wholly contained within a census tract) to ensure coherent and consistent results. For scenarios with limited historical training data, we explore transfer learning and show that a model pre-trained on one city variable can be fine-tuned for another city variable using only a few hundred samples. Evaluating these techniques on two mobility datasets, we find that on both datasets, SARN significantly outperforms other neural models (5% and 1%) and typical heuristic methods (40% and 14%), enabling us to generate realistic, high-quality fine-grained data for downstream applications.</p></details> |  |

Different from conventional approaches that statically estimate fetal brain motions from pairs of images, our method dynamically tracks the rigid movement patterns of the fetal head across temporal and spatial dimensions. Specifically, we first develop an equivariant neural network that efficiently learns rigid motion sequences through low-dimensional spatial representations of images. Subsequently, we learn spatio-temporal representations by incorporating time encoding and self-attention neural network layers. This approach allows for the capture of long-term dependencies of fetal brain motion and addresses alignment errors due to contrast changes and severe motion artifacts. Our model also provides a geometric deformation estimation that properly addresses image distortions among all time frames. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to learn spatial-temporal representations via deep neural networks for fetal motion tracking without data augmentation. We validated our model using real fetal echo-planar images with simulated and real motions. Our method carries significant potential value in accurately measuring, tracking, and correcting fetal motion in fetal MRI sequences.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions (MICCAI) Workshop on Perinatal Imaging, Placental and Preterm Image analysis (PIPPI) 2024</p></details> |
| **[STANet: A Novel Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network for Depression Classification with Small and Unbalanced FMRI Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21323v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate diagnosis of depression is crucial for timely implementation of optimal treatments, preventing complications and reducing the risk of suicide. Traditional methods rely on self-report questionnaires and clinical assessment, lacking objective biomarkers. Combining fMRI with artificial intelligence can enhance depression diagnosis by integrating neuroimaging indicators. However, the specificity of fMRI acquisition for depression often results in unbalanced and small datasets, challenging the sensitivity and accuracy of classification models. In this study, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network (STANet) for diagnosing depression by integrating CNN and RNN to capture both temporal and spatial features of brain activity. STANet comprises the following steps:(1) Aggregate spatio-temporal information via ICA. (2) Utilize multi-scale deep convolution to capture detailed features. (3) Balance data using the SMOTE to generate new samples for minority classes. (4) Employ the AFGRU classifier, which combines Fourier transformation with GRU, to capture long-term dependencies, with an adaptive weight assignment mechanism to enhance model generalization. The experimental results demonstrate that STANet achieves superior depression diagnostic performance with 82.38% accuracy and a 90.72% AUC. The STFA module enhances classification by capturing deeper features at multiple scales. The AFGRU classifier, with adaptive weights and stacked GRU, attains higher accuracy and AUC. SMOTE outperforms other oversampling methods. Additionally, spatio-temporal aggregated features achieve better performance compared to using only temporal or spatial features. STANet outperforms traditional or deep learning classifiers, and functional connectivity-based classifiers, as demonstrated by ten-fold cross-validation.</p></details> |  |

These programs are being increasingly asked to provide forest parameter estimates for spatial and temporal extents smaller than their current design and accompanying design-based methods can deliver with desired levels of uncertainty. Many NFI designs and estimation methods focus on status and are not well equipped to provide acceptable estimates for trend and change parameters, especially over small spatial domains and/or short time periods. Fine-scale space-time indexed estimates are critical to a variety of environmental, ecological, and economic monitoring efforts. Estimates for forest carbon status, trend, and change are of particular importance to international initiatives to track carbon dynamics. Model-based small area estimation (SAE) methods for NFI and similar ecological monitoring data typically pursue inference on status within small spatial domains, with few demonstrated methods that account for spatio-temporal dependence needed for trend and change estimation. We propose a spatio-temporal Bayesian model framework that delivers statistically valid estimates with full uncertainty quantification for status, trend, and change. The framework accommodates a variety of space and time dependency structures, and we detail model configurations for different settings. Through analysis of simulated datasets, we compare the relative performance of candidate models and a traditional direct estimator. We then apply candidate models to a large-scale NFI dataset to demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework for providing unique quantification of forest carbon dynamics in the contiguous United States. We also provide computationally efficient algorithms, software, and data to reproduce our results and for benchmarking.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpotFormer: Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Transformer for Facial Expression Spotting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20799v1)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial expression spotting, identifying periods where facial expressions occur in a video, is a significant yet challenging task in facial expression analysis. The issues of irrelevant facial movements and the challenge of detecting subtle motions in micro-expressions remain unresolved, hindering accurate expression spotting. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for facial expression spotting. First, we propose a Sliding Window-based Multi-Resolution Optical flow (SW-MRO) feature, which calculates multi-resolution optical flow of the input image sequence within compact sliding windows. The window length is tailored to perceive complete micro-expressions and distinguish between general macro- and micro-expressions. SW-MRO can effectively reveal subtle motions while avoiding severe head movement problems. Second, we propose SpotFormer, a multi-scale spatio-temporal Transformer that simultaneously encodes spatio-temporal relationships of the SW-MRO features for accurate frame-level probability estimation. In SpotFormer, our proposed Facial Local Graph Pooling (FLGP) and convolutional layers are applied for multi-scale spatio-temporal feature extraction. We show the validity of the architecture of SpotFormer by comparing it with several model variants. Third, we introduce supervised contrastive learning into SpotFormer to enhance the discriminability between different types of expressions. Extensive experiments on SAMM-LV and CAS(ME)^2 show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models, particularly in micro-expression spotting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Orca: Ocean Significant Wave Height Estimation with Spatio-temporally Aware Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20053v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Significant wave height (SWH) is a vital metric in marine science, and accurate SWH estimation is crucial for various applications, e.g., marine energy development, fishery, early warning systems for potential risks, etc. Traditional SWH estimation methods that are based on numerical models and physical theories are hindered by computational inefficiencies. Recently, machine learning has emerged as an appealing alternative to improve accuracy and reduce computational time. However, due to limited observational technology and high costs, the scarcity of real-world data restricts the potential of machine learning models. To overcome these limitations, we propose an ocean SWH estimation framework, namely Orca. Specifically, Orca enhances the limited spatio-temporal reasoning abilities of classic LLMs with a novel spatiotemporal aware encoding module. By segmenting the limited buoy observational data temporally, encoding the buoys' locations spatially, and designing prompt templates, Orca capitalizes on the robust generalization ability of LLMs to estimate significant wave height effectively with limited data. Experimental results on the Gulf of Mexico demonstrate that Orca achieves state-of-the-art performance in SWH estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Deepsets for Off-policy Evaluation under Spatial or Spatio-temporal Interferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17910v1)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is widely applied in sectors such as pharmaceuticals and e-commerce to evaluate the efficacy of novel products or policies from offline datasets. This paper introduces a causal deepset framework that relaxes several key structural assumptions, primarily the mean-field assumption, prevalent in existing OPE methodologies that handle spatio-temporal interference. These traditional assumptions frequently prove inadequate in real-world settings, thereby restricting the capability of current OPE methods to effectively address complex interference effects. In response, we advocate for the implementation of the permutation invariance (PI) assumption. This innovative approach enables the data-driven, adaptive learning of the mean-field function, offering a more flexible estimation method beyond conventional averaging. Furthermore, we present novel algorithms that incorporate the PI assumption into OPE and thoroughly examine their theoretical foundations. Our numerical analyses demonstrate that this novel approach yields significantly more precise estimations than existing baseline algorithms, thereby substantially improving the practical applicability and effectiveness of OPE methodologies. A Python implementation of our proposed method is available at https://github.com/BIG-S2/Causal-Deepsets.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods either utilize multi-modal information in video-text pairs or apply global and local alignment techniques to promote alignment precision. However, these methods often fail to fully explore the spatio-temporal relationships among vision tokens within video and across different video-text pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer module to uniformly learn spatial and temporal contexts for video-language alignment pre-training (dubbed STGT). Specifically, our STGT combines spatio-temporal graph structure information with attention in transformer block, effectively utilizing the spatio-temporal contexts. In this way, we can model the relationships between vision tokens, promoting video-text alignment precision for benefiting downstream tasks. In addition, we propose a self-similarity alignment loss to explore the inherent self-similarity in the video and text. With the initial optimization achieved by contrastive learning, it can further promote the alignment accuracy between video and text. Experimental results on challenging downstream tasks, including video-text retrieval and video question answering, verify the superior performance of our method.</p></details> | under review |

The knowledge tree enables the visualization of hierarchical interrelation within the STKG, while the knowledge net elucidates semantic relationships among knowledge entities. Additionally, the knowledge map displays spatial and temporal distributions via spatial maps and time axes, respectively. Our visualization technology addresses the limitations inherent in single-view approaches and the deficiency of interaction in spatio-temporal perspectives evident in existing visualization methods. Moreover, we have encapsulated this technology within an integrated, open-source platform named GeoViz.

| **[Towards Effective Fusion and Forecasting of Multimodal Spatio-temporal Data for Smart Mobility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16123v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of location based services, multimodal spatio-temporal (ST) data including trajectories, transportation modes, traffic flow and social check-ins are being collected for deep learning based methods. These deep learning based methods learn ST correlations to support the downstream tasks in the fields such as smart mobility, smart city and other intelligent transportation systems. Despite their effectiveness, ST data fusion and forecasting methods face practical challenges in real-world scenarios. First, forecasting performance for ST data-insufficient area is inferior, making it necessary to transfer meta knowledge from heterogeneous area to enhance the sparse representations. Second, it is nontrivial to accurately forecast in multi-transportation-mode scenarios due to the fine-grained ST features of similar transportation modes, making it necessary to distinguish and measure the ST correlations to alleviate the influence caused by entangled ST features. At last, partial data modalities (e.g., transportation mode) are lost due to privacy or technical issues in certain scenarios, making it necessary to effectively fuse the multimodal sparse ST features and enrich the ST representations. To tackle these challenges, our research work aim to develop effective fusion and forecasting methods for multimodal ST data in smart mobility scenario. In this paper, we will introduce our recent works that investigates the challenges in terms of various real-world applications and establish the open challenges in this field for future work.</p></details> | 4 pages |

Although Bayesian methods are common in spatio-temporal modeling, standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques are usually slow for large datasets such as house price data. To tackle this problem, we propose a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal modeling approach. This method involves partitioning the data into multiple subsets and applying an appropriate Gaussian process model to each subset in parallel. The results from each subset are then combined using the Wasserstein barycenter technique to obtain the global parameters for the original problem. The proposed methodology allows for multiple observations per spatial and time unit, thereby offering added benefits for practitioners. As a real-life application, we analyze house price data of more than 0.6 million transactions from 983 middle layer super output areas in London over a period of eight years. The methodology provides insightful findings about the effects of various amenities, trend patterns, and the relationship between prices and carbon emissions. Furthermore, as demonstrated through a cross-validation study, it shows good predictive accuracy while balancing computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary material is available from the authors upon request</p></details> |

Large space-time datasets call for new numerical methods to efficiently process them. The Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) approach has proven to be effective for the estimation and the prediction in a spatial context. We present here the advection-diffusion SPDE with first order derivative in time which defines a large class of nonseparable spatio-temporal models. A Gaussian Markov random field approximation of the solution to the SPDE is built by discretizing the temporal derivative with a finite difference method (implicit Euler) and by solving the spatial SPDE with a finite element method (continuous Galerkin) at each time step. The ''Streamline Diffusion'' stabilization technique is introduced when the advection term dominates the diffusion. Computationally efficient methods are proposed to estimate the parameters of the SPDE and to predict the spatio-temporal field by kriging, as well as to perform conditional simulations. The approach is applied to a solar radiation dataset. Its advantages and limitations are discussed.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Approach with Self-Corrective Causal Inference for Flight Delay Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15185v1)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate flight delay prediction is crucial for the secure and effective operation of the air traffic system. Recent advances in modeling inter-airport relationships present a promising approach for investigating flight delay prediction from the multi-airport scenario. However, the previous prediction works only accounted for the simplistic relationships such as traffic flow or geographical distance, overlooking the intricate interactions among airports and thus proving inadequate. In this paper, we leverage causal inference to precisely model inter-airport relationships and propose a self-corrective spatio-temporal graph neural network (named CausalNet) for flight delay prediction. Specifically, Granger causality inference coupled with a self-correction module is designed to construct causality graphs among airports and dynamically modify them based on the current airport's delays. Additionally, the features of the causality graphs are adaptively extracted and utilized to address the heterogeneity of airports. Extensive experiments are conducted on the real data of top-74 busiest airports in China. The results show that CausalNet is superior to baselines. Ablation studies emphasize the power of the proposed self-correction causality graph and the graph feature extraction module. All of these prove the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Source and Test-Time Domain Adaptation on Multivariate Signals using Spatio-Temporal Monge Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14303v1)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning applications on signals such as computer vision or biomedical data often face significant challenges due to the variability that exists across hardware devices or session recordings. This variability poses a Domain Adaptation (DA) problem, as training and testing data distributions often differ. In this work, we propose Spatio-Temporal Monge Alignment (STMA) to mitigate these variabilities. This Optimal Transport (OT) based method adapts the cross-power spectrum density (cross-PSD) of multivariate signals by mapping them to the Wasserstein barycenter of source domains (multi-source DA). Predictions for new domains can be done with a filtering without the need for retraining a model with source data (test-time DA). We also study and discuss two special cases of the method, Temporal Monge Alignment (TMA) and Spatial Monge Alignment (SMA). Non-asymptotic concentration bounds are derived for the mappings estimation, which reveals a bias-plus-variance error structure with a variance decay rate of $\mathcal{O}(n_\ell^{-1/2})$ with $n_\ell$ the signal length. This theoretical guarantee demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed computational schema. Numerical experiments on multivariate biosignals and image data show that STMA leads to significant and consistent performance gains between datasets acquired with very different settings. Notably, STMA is a pre-processing step complementary to state-of-the-art deep learning methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Higher-order Spatio-temporal Physics-incorporated Graph Neural Network for Multivariate Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10995v2)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploring the missing values is an essential but challenging issue due to the complex latent spatio-temporal correlation and dynamic nature of time series. Owing to the outstanding performance in dealing with structure learning potentials, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are often used to capture such complex spatio-temporal features in multivariate time series. However, these data-driven models often fail to capture the essential spatio-temporal relationships when significant signal corruption occurs. Additionally, calculating the high-order neighbor nodes in these models is of high computational complexity. To address these problems, we propose a novel higher-order spatio-temporal physics-incorporated GNN (HSPGNN). Firstly, the dynamic Laplacian matrix can be obtained by the spatial attention mechanism. Then, the generic inhomogeneous partial differential equation (PDE) of physical dynamic systems is used to construct the dynamic higher-order spatio-temporal GNN to obtain the missing time series values. Moreover, we estimate the missing impact by Normalizing Flows (NF) to evaluate the importance of each node in the graph for better explainability. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HSPGNN and the superior performance when combining various order neighbor nodes. Also, graph-like optical flow, dynamic graphs, and missing impact can be obtained naturally by HSPGNN, which provides better dynamic analysis and explanation than traditional data-driven models.

Traditional methods rely on hand-crafted features and machine learning techniques, which often struggle to model the complex dynamics of human motion. Recent deep learning-based methods have achieved success by learning spatio-temporal representations of motion, but these models often overlook the reliability of motion data. Additionally, the temporal and spatial dependencies of skeleton nodes are distinct. The temporal relationship captures motion information over time, while the spatial relationship describes body structure and the relationships between different nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal branching network using incremental information for HMP, which decouples the learning of temporal-domain and spatial-domain features, extracts more motion information, and achieves complementary cross-domain knowledge learning through knowledge distillation. Our approach effectively reduces noise interference and provides more expressive information for characterizing motion by separately extracting temporal and spatial features. We evaluate our approach on standard HMP benchmarks and outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>The i...</summary><p>The incremental information of our paper includes the displacement information from the last frame of the historical sequence, derived from the motion information of the first frame in the future sequence and the motion information of the last frame of the historical sequence.

Changes in the size, shape and movement of the chambers can be important markers for cardiac disease and modeling this in relation to clinical demography or disease is therefore of interest. Existing methods for spatio-temporal modeling of the human heart require shape correspondence over time or suffer from large memory requirements, making it difficult to use for complex anatomies. We introduce a novel conditional generative model, where the shape and movement is modeled implicitly in the form of a spatio-temporal neural distance field and conditioned on clinical demography. The model is based on an auto-decoder architecture and aims to disentangle the individual variations from that related to the clinical demography. It is tested on the left atrium (including the left atrial appendage), where it outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for anatomical sequence completion and generates synthetic sequences that realistically mimics the shape and motion of the real left atrium. In practice, this means we can infer functional measurements from a static image, generate synthetic populations with specified demography or disease and investigate how non-imaging clinical data effect the shape and motion of cardiac anatomies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for MICCAI2024</p></details> |

However, estimating incidence or mortality rates associated with rare cancers presents important difficulties and poses new statistical methodological challenges. In this paper, we expand the collection of multivariate spatio-temporal models by introducing adaptable shared spatio-temporal components to enable a comprehensive analysis of both incidence and cancer mortality in rare cancer cases. These models allow the modulation of spatio-temporal effects between incidence and mortality, allowing for changes in their relationship over time. The new models have been implemented in INLA using r-generic constructions. We conduct a simulation study to evaluate the performance of the new spatio-temporal models. Our results show that multivariate spatio-temporal models incorporating a flexible shared spatio-temporal term outperform conventional multivariate spatio-temporal models that include specific spatio-temporal effects for each health outcome. We use these models to analyze incidence and mortality data for pancreatic cancer and leukaemia among males across 142 administrative health care districts of Great Britain over a span of nine biennial periods (2002-2019).</p></details> | 40 pages, 12 figures |

To address this limitation, this paper presents the spatio-temporal GraphFormer framework for 3D human pose estimation in video, which integrates body structure graph-based representations with spatio-temporal information. Specifically, we develop a spatio-temporal criss-cross graph (STG) attention mechanism. This approach is designed to learn the long-range dependencies in data across both time and space, integrating graph information directly into the respective attention layers. Furthermore, we introduce the dual-path modulated hop-wise regular GCN (MHR-GCN) module, which utilizes modulation to optimize parameter usage and employs spatio-temporal hop-wise skip connections to acquire higher-order information. Additionally, this module processes temporal and spatial dimensions independently to learn their respective features while avoiding mutual influence. Finally, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D human pose estimation on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets.</p></details> |  |

We propose a Spatio-Temporal Aligned SUNet (STA-SUNet) model using a Swin Transformer as a backbone to capture low light video features and exploit their spatio-temporal correlations. The STA-SUNet model is trained on a novel, fully registered dataset (BVI), which comprises dynamic scenes captured under varying light conditions. It is further analysed comparatively against various other models over three test datasets. The model demonstrates superior adaptivity across all datasets, obtaining the highest PSNR and SSIM values. It is particularly effective in extreme low-light conditions, yielding fairly good visualisation results.</p></details> |  |

In this regard, covariance properties with respect to geometric image transformations in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy are essential for expressing robust image operations, and for formulating invariant visual operations at higher levels. This paper defines and proves a set of joint covariance properties for spatio-temporal receptive fields in terms of spatio-temporal derivative operators applied to spatio-temporally smoothed image data under compositions of spatial scaling transformations, spatial affine transformations, Galilean transformations and temporal scaling transformations. Specifically, the derived relations show how the parameters of the receptive fields need to be transformed, in order to match the output from spatio-temporal receptive fields under composed spatio-temporal image transformations. For this purpose, we also fundamentally extend the notion of scale-normalized derivatives to affine-normalized derivatives, that are computed based on spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels, and analyze the covariance properties of the resulting affine-normalized derivatives for the affine group as well as for important subgroups thereof. We conclude with a geometric analysis, showing how the derived joint covariance properties make it possible to relate or match spatio-temporal receptive field responses, when observing, possibly moving, local surface patches from different views, under locally linearized perspective or projective transformations, as well as when observing different instances of spatio-temporal events, that may occur either faster or slower between different views of similar spatio-temporal events.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 13 figures.

If an AV can predict its surrounding vehicles' future trajectories, it can make safe and efficient manoeuvre decisions. In this paper, we present such a Deep Spatio-Temporal Context-Aware decision Network (DST-CAN) model for predictive manoeuvre planning of AVs. A memory neuron network is used to predict future trajectories of its surrounding vehicles. The driving environment's spatio-temporal information (past, present, and predicted future trajectories) are embedded into a context-aware grid. The proposed DST-CAN model employs these context-aware grids as inputs to a convolutional neural network to understand the spatial relationships between the vehicles and determine a safe and efficient manoeuvre decision. The DST-CAN model also uses information of human driving behavior on a highway. Performance evaluation of DST-CAN has been carried out using two publicly available NGSIM US-101 and I-80 datasets. Also, rule-based ground truth decisions have been compared with those generated by DST-CAN. The results clearly show that DST-CAN can make much better decisions with 3-sec of predicted trajectories of neighboring vehicles compared to currently existing methods that do not use this prediction.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

Traditional methods based on generative adversarial networks(GAN) or joint learning frameworks can achieve good prediction accuracy under low observation ratios, but they usually have high computational costs. In view of this, this paper proposes a spatio-temporal encoding and decoding-based method for future human activity skeleton synthesis. Firstly, algorithms such as time control, discrete cosine transform, and low-pass filtering are used to cut or pad the skeleton sequences. Secondly, the encoder and decoder are responsible for extracting intermediate semantic encoding from observed skeleton sequences and inferring future sequences from the intermediate semantic encoding, respectively. Finally, joint displacement error, velocity error, and acceleration error, three higher-order kinematic features, are used as key components of the loss function to optimize model parameters. Experimental results show that the proposed future skeleton synthesis algorithm performs better than some existing algorithms. It generates skeleton sequences with smaller errors and fewer model parameters, effectively providing future information for early activity prediction.</p></details> |  |

We train this model on the Raw Heidelberg Digits keyword spotting benchmark using Backpropagation Through Time with surrogate gradients. Analysing the spatio-temporal structure of synaptic interactions in the network we observe that after training excitation and inhibition are grouped together both in space and time. To further enhance the efficiency and biological realism of our model, we implemented a dynamic pruning strategy that combines DEEP R for connection removal and RigL for connection reintroduction, ensuring that the network maintains optimal connectivity throughout training. Additionally, we incorporated Dale's Principle, enforcing each neuron to be exclusively excitatory or inhibitory -- aligning our model closer to biological neural networks. We observed that, after training, the spatio-temporal patterns of excitation and inhibition appeared in the more biologically plausible model as well. Our research demonstrates the potential of integrating learnable delays, dynamic pruning, and biological constraints to develop efficient SNN models for temporal data processing. Furthermore, our results enhance the understanding of spatio-temporal dynamics in SNNs -- suggesting that the spatio-temporal features which emerge from training are robust to both pruning and rewiring processes -- providing a solid foundation for future work in neuromorphic computing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, submitted to Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Bayesian dynamic closed skew-normal model preserving mean and covariance for spatio-temporal data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05288v1)** | 2024-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Bayesian skew-normal models are useful for flexibly modeling spatio-temporal processes, they still have difficulty in computation cost and interpretability in their mean and variance parameters, including regression coefficients. To address these problems, this study proposes a spatio-temporal model that incorporates skewness while maintaining mean and variance, by applying the flexible subclass of the closed skew-normal distribution. An efficient sampling method is introduced, leveraging the autoregressive representation of the model. Additionally, the model's symmetry concerning spatial order is demonstrated, and Mardia's skewness and kurtosis are derived, showing independence from the mean and variance. Simulation studies compare the estimation performance of the proposed model with that of the Gaussian model. The result confirms its superiority in high skewness and low observation noise scenarios. The identification of Cobb-Douglas production functions across US states is examined as an application to real data, revealing that the proposed model excels in both goodness-of-fit and predictive performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Adversarial Networks for Spatio-Spectral Compression of Hyperspectral Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08514v3)** | 2024-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of deep learning-based models for the compression of hyperspectral images (HSIs) has recently attracted great attention in remote sensing due to the sharp growing of hyperspectral data archives. Most of the existing models achieve either spectral or spatial compression, and do not jointly consider the spatio-spectral redundancies present in HSIs. To address this problem, in this paper we focus our attention on the High Fidelity Compression (HiFiC) model (which is proven to be highly effective for spatial compression problems) and adapt it to perform spatio-spectral compression of HSIs. In detail, we introduce two new models: i) HiFiC using Squeeze and Excitation (SE) blocks (denoted as HiFiC$_{SE}$); and ii) HiFiC with 3D convolutions (denoted as HiFiC$_{3D}$) in the framework of compression of HSIs. We analyze the effectiveness of HiFiC$_{SE}$ and HiFiC$_{3D}$ in compressing the spatio-spectral redundancies with channel attention and inter-dependency analysis. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed models in performing spatio-spectral compression, while reconstructing images at reduced bitrates with higher reconstruction quality. The code of the proposed models is publicly available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/HSI-SSC .</p></details> |  |

We train these networks to predict the dynamics of delay-dynamical and spatio-temporal systems for a single size. Then, we drive the networks by their own predictions. We demonstrate that by scaling the size of the trained network, we can predict the complex dynamics for larger or smaller system sizes. Thus, the network learns from a single example and, by exploiting symmetry properties, infers entire bifurcation diagrams.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enabling Multicast Transmission for Spatio-Temporally Asynchronous User Requests in Wireless Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04239v1)** | 2024-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The surge in wireless devices and data traffic volume necessitates more efficient transmission methods. Multicasting has garnered consistent attention as a means to fulfill the increasing demand for more efficient data transmission methods. Nevertheless, leveraging multicast wireless networks for spatio-temporally asynchronous data requests poses challenges. In this context, this paper introduces a new multicast mechanism called \emph{set-up based merged multicast (SMMC)} to minimize the delivery time of the requested file in wireless networks by considering the uncertainties inherent in wireless channels. The proposed mechanism comprises two phases. The first phase involves gathering asynchronous requests for a file from users experiencing diverse channel conditions. During this phase, packets of the requested file are transmitted individually in unicast mode within a specified set-up time. Following this, the second phase initiates multicast transmission, which sequentially handles the remaining packets of the file in multicast mode. In the proposed mechanism, we optimize the set-up time and transmission rates of both unicast and multicast modes to minimize the expected file delivery time by jointly taking into account the statistical characteristics of wireless channels, users' locations, and file popularity. Additionally, we also delve into a \emph{fine-tuned SMMC} by utilizing posterior information on the multicast group size and further improve the performance. Our performance evaluations reveal that the proposed SMMC outperforms conventional unicast methods, especially with high-demand data.</p></details> |  |

In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from the stochastic processes associated with the particle labels. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over a large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the limiting dynamics of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</p></details> |  |

Many research works, including Potential Outcome Model and Structural Causal Model, have been proposed to realize it. However, their modelings, theoretical foundations and application approaches are usually different. Moreover, there is a lack of graphical approach to infer spatio-temporal counterfactuals, that considers spatial and temporal interactions between multiple units. Thus, in this work, our aim is to investigate a survey to compare and discuss different counterfactual models, theories and approaches, and further build a unified graphical causal frameworks to infer the spatio-temporal counterfactuals.</p></details> |  |

Despite remarkable breakthroughs in pretrained natural language models that enable one model to handle diverse tasks, a universal solution for spatio-temporal prediction remains challenging Existing prediction approaches are typically tailored for specific spatio-temporal scenarios, requiring task-specific model designs and extensive domain-specific training data. In this study, we introduce UniST, a universal model designed for general urban spatio-temporal prediction across a wide range of scenarios. Inspired by large language models, UniST achieves success through: (i) utilizing diverse spatio-temporal data from different scenarios, (ii) effective pre-training to capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics, (iii) knowledge-guided prompts to enhance generalization capabilities. These designs together unlock the potential of building a universal model for various scenarios Extensive experiments on more than 20 spatio-temporal scenarios demonstrate UniST's efficacy in advancing state-of-the-art performance, especially in few-shot and zero-shot prediction.

| **[Towards Time Series Reasoning with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11376v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled numerous advances in understanding and reasoning in domains like vision, but we have not yet seen this broad success for time-series. Although prior works on time-series MLLMs have shown promising performance in time-series forecasting, very few works show how an LLM could be used for time-series reasoning in natural language. We propose a novel multi-modal time-series LLM approach that learns generalizable information across various domains with powerful zero-shot performance. First, we train a lightweight time-series encoder on top of an LLM to directly extract time-series information. Then, we fine-tune our model with chain-of-thought augmented time-series tasks to encourage the model to generate reasoning paths. We show that our model learns a latent representation that reflects specific time-series features (e.g. slope, frequency), as well as outperforming GPT-4o on a set of zero-shot reasoning tasks on a variety of domains.</p></details> |  |

While numerous ML models for flow cytometry data have been proposed, few studies have described the clinical deployment of such models. Realizing the potential gains of ML models in clinical labs requires not only an accurate model, but infrastructure for automated inference, error detection, analytics and monitoring, and structured data extraction. Here, we describe an ML model for detection of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), along with the infrastructure supporting clinical implementation. Our infrastructure leverages the resilience and scalability of the cloud for model inference, a Kubernetes-based workflow system that provides model reproducibility and resource management, and a system for extracting structured diagnoses from full-text reports. We also describe our model monitoring and visualization platform, an essential element for ensuring continued model accuracy. Finally, we present a post-deployment analysis of impacts on turn-around time and compare production accuracy to the original validation statistics.</p></details> |  |

We present a method for estimating the possibly unstable open-loop matrix by employing properly randomized control inputs. Then, we establish theoretical performance guarantees showing that the estimation error decays with trajectory length, a measure of excitability, and the signal-to-noise ratio, while it grows with dimension. Numerical illustrations that showcase the rates of learning the dynamics, will be provided as well. To perform the theoretical analysis, we develop new technical tools that are of independent interest. That includes non-asymptotic stochastic bounds for highly non-stationary martingales and generalized laws of iterated logarithms, among others.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond LoRA: Exploring Efficient Fine-Tuning Techniques for Time Series Foundational Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11302v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have recently garnered attention for their ability to model complex, large-scale time series data across domains such as retail, finance, and transportation. However, their application to sensitive, domain-specific fields like healthcare remains challenging, primarily due to the difficulty of fine-tuning these models for specialized, out-of-domain tasks with scarce publicly available datasets. In this work, we explore the use of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques to address these limitations, focusing on healthcare applications, particularly ICU vitals forecasting for sepsis patients. We introduce and evaluate two selective (BitFit and LayerNorm Tuning) and two additive (VeRA and FourierFT) PEFT techniques on multiple configurations of the Chronos TSFM for forecasting vital signs of sepsis patients. Our comparative analysis demonstrates that some of these PEFT methods outperform LoRA in terms of parameter efficiency and domain adaptation, establishing state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in ICU vital forecasting tasks. Interestingly, FourierFT applied to the Chronos (Tiny) variant surpasses the SOTA model while fine-tuning only 2,400 parameters compared to the 700K parameters of the benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages.

However, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, the most commonly used architectures for this task, struggle to effectively capture long-range dependencies due to the inherent locality of CNNs and the computational complexity of Transformers. To address this limitation, we introduce TTT-Unet, a novel framework that integrates Test-Time Training (TTT) layers into the traditional U-Net architecture for biomedical image segmentation. TTT-Unet dynamically adjusts model parameters during the testing time, enhancing the model's ability to capture both local and long-range features. We evaluate TTT-Unet on multiple medical imaging datasets, including 3D abdominal organ segmentation in CT and MR images, instrument segmentation in endoscopy images, and cell segmentation in microscopy images. The results demonstrate that TTT-Unet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CNN-based and Transformer-based segmentation models across all tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/rongzhou7/TTT-Unet.</p></details> |  |
| **[Linear Recency Bias During Training Improves Transformers' Fit to Reading Times](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11250v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent psycholinguistic research has compared human reading times to surprisal estimates from language models to study the factors shaping human sentence processing difficulty. Previous studies have shown a strong fit between surprisal values from Transformers and reading times. However, standard Transformers work with a lossless representation of the entire previous linguistic context, unlike models of human language processing that include memory decay. To bridge this gap, this paper evaluates a modification of the Transformer model that uses ALiBi (Press et al., 2022), a recency bias added to attention scores. Surprisal estimates with ALiBi show an improved fit to human reading times compared to a standard Transformer baseline. A subsequent analysis of attention heads suggests that ALiBi's mixture of slopes -- which determine the rate of memory decay in each attention head -- may play a role in the improvement by helping models with ALiBi to track different kinds of linguistic dependencies.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Continuous-time Tractable Model for Present-biased Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11225v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Present bias, the tendency to overvalue immediate rewards while undervaluing future ones, is a well-known barrier to achieving long-term goals. As artificial intelligence and behavioral economics increasingly focus on this phenomenon, the need for robust mathematical models to predict behavior and guide effective interventions has become crucial. However, existing models are constrained by their reliance on the discreteness of time and limited discount functions. This study introduces a novel continuous-time mathematical model for agents influenced by present bias. Using the variational principle, we model human behavior, where individuals repeatedly act according to a sequence of states that minimize their perceived cost. Our model not only retains analytical tractability but also accommodates various discount functions. Using this model, we consider intervention optimization problems under exponential and hyperbolic discounting and theoretically derive optimal intervention strategies, offering new insights into managing present-biased behavior.</p></details> | 22 pages, 4 figures |
| **[TivNe-SLAM: Dynamic Mapping and Tracking via Time-Varying Neural Radiance Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18917v6)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous attempts to integrate Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) into the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) framework either rely on the assumption of static scenes or require the ground truth camera poses, which impedes their application in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a time-varying representation to track and reconstruct the dynamic scenes. Firstly, two processes, a tracking process and a mapping process, are maintained simultaneously in our framework. In the tracking process, all input images are uniformly sampled and then progressively trained in a self-supervised paradigm. In the mapping process, we leverage motion masks to distinguish dynamic objects from the static background, and sample more pixels from dynamic areas. Secondly, the parameter optimization for both processes is comprised of two stages: the first stage associates time with 3D positions to convert the deformation field to the canonical field. The second stage associates time with the embeddings of the canonical field to obtain colors and a Signed Distance Function (SDF). Lastly, we propose a novel keyframe selection strategy based on the overlapping rate. Our approach is evaluated on two synthetic datasets and one real-world dataset, and the experiments validate that our method achieves competitive results in both tracking and mapping when compared to existing state-of-the-art NeRF-based dynamic SLAM systems.</p></details> |  |

The motivation behind these constructions is to enable theoretically well-founded time-frequency analysis over multiple temporal scales for real-time situations, or for physical or biological modelling situations, when the future cannot be accessed, and the non-causal access to future in Gabor filtering is therefore not viable for a time-frequency analysis of the system. We develop the theory for these representations, obtained by replacing the Gaussian kernel in Gabor filtering with a time-causal kernel, referred to as the time-causal limit kernel, which guarantees simplification properties from finer to coarser levels of scales in a time-causal situation, similar as the Gaussian kernel can be shown to guarantee over a non-causal temporal domain. In these ways, the proposed time-frequency representations guarantee well-founded treatment over multiple scales, in situations when the characteristic scales in the signals, or physical or biological phenomena, to be analyzed may vary substantially, and additionally all steps in the time-frequency analysis have to be fully time-causal.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables, 1 algorithm</p></details> |

This paper introduces a versatile and transferable digital ecosystem for managing time series data, designed to adhere to the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). The system is highly adaptable, cloud-ready, and suitable for deployment in a wide range of settings, from small-scale projects to large-scale monitoring initiatives. The ecosystem comprises three core components: the Sensor Management System (SMS) for detailed metadata registration and management; timeIO, a platform for efficient time series data storage, transfer, and real-time visualization; and the System for Automated Quality Control (SaQC), which ensures data integrity through real-time analysis and quality assurance. The modular architecture, combined with standardized protocols and interfaces, ensures that the ecosystem can be easily transferred and deployed across different environments and institutions. This approach enhances data accessibility for a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including researchers, policymakers, and the public, while fostering collaboration and advancing scientific research in environmental monitoring.</p></details> |  |
| **[D2Vformer: A Flexible Time Series Prediction Model Based on Time Position Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11024v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time position embeddings capture the positional information of time steps, often serving as auxiliary inputs to enhance the predictive capabilities of time series models. However, existing models exhibit limitations in capturing intricate time positional information and effectively utilizing these embeddings. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel model called D2Vformer. Unlike typical prediction methods that rely on RNNs or Transformers, this approach can directly handle scenarios where the predicted sequence is not adjacent to the input sequence or where its length dynamically changes. In comparison to conventional methods, D2Vformer undoubtedly saves a significant amount of training resources. In D2Vformer, the Date2Vec module uses the timestamp information and feature sequences to generate time position embeddings. Afterward, D2Vformer introduces a new fusion block that utilizes an attention mechanism to explore the similarity in time positions between the embeddings of the input sequence and the predicted sequence, thereby generating predictions based on this similarity. Through extensive experiments on six datasets, we demonstrate that Date2Vec outperforms other time position embedding methods, and D2Vformer surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both fixed-length and variable-length prediction tasks.</p></details> |  |

Despite the reported improvements in several papers, the practical application of these models remains limited. Recent studies have cast doubt on these models, attributing their results to flawed evaluation techniques. However, the impact of initialization has largely been overlooked. This paper provides a critical analysis of the initialization effects on TSAD model performance. Our extensive experiments reveal that TSAD models are highly sensitive to hyperparameters such as window size, seed number, and normalization. This sensitivity often leads to significant variability in performance, which can be exploited to artificially inflate the reported efficacy of these models. We demonstrate that even minor changes in initialization parameters can result in performance variations that overshadow the claimed improvements from novel model architectures. Our findings highlight the need for rigorous evaluation protocols and transparent reporting of preprocessing steps to ensure the reliability and fairness of anomaly detection methods. This paper calls for a more cautious interpretation of TSAD advancements and encourages the development of more robust and transparent evaluation practices to advance the field and its practical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing TinyML: The Impact of Reduced Data Acquisition Rates for Time Series Classification on Microcontrollers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10942v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) enables efficient, lowcost, and privacy preserving machine learning inference directly on microcontroller units (MCUs) connected to sensors. Optimizing models for these constrained environments is crucial. This paper investigates how reducing data acquisition rates affects TinyML models for time series classification, focusing on resource-constrained, battery operated IoT devices. By lowering data sampling frequency, we aim to reduce computational demands RAM usage, energy consumption, latency, and MAC operations by approximately fourfold while maintaining similar classification accuracies. Our experiments with six benchmark datasets (UCIHAR, WISDM, PAMAP2, MHEALTH, MITBIH, and PTB) showed that reducing data acquisition rates significantly cut energy consumption and computational load, with minimal accuracy loss. For example, a 75\% reduction in acquisition rate for MITBIH and PTB datasets led to a 60\% decrease in RAM usage, 75\% reduction in MAC operations, 74\% decrease in latency, and 70\% reduction in energy consumption, without accuracy loss. These results offer valuable insights for deploying efficient TinyML models in constrained environments.</p></details> |  |

It has been, very unfortunately, misused to produce deepfake videos (during web conferences, video calls, and identity authentication) for malicious purposes, including financial scams and political misinformation. Deepfake detection, as the countermeasure against deepfake, has attracted considerable attention from the academic community, yet existing works typically rely on learning passive features that may perform poorly beyond seen datasets. In this paper, we propose SFake, a new real-time deepfake detection method that innovatively exploits deepfake models' inability to adapt to physical interference. Specifically, SFake actively sends probes to trigger mechanical vibrations on the smartphone, resulting in the controllable feature on the footage. Consequently, SFake determines whether the face is swapped by deepfake based on the consistency of the facial area with the probe pattern. We implement SFake, evaluate its effectiveness on a self-built dataset, and compare it with six other detection methods. The results show that SFake outperforms other detection methods with higher detection accuracy, faster process speed, and lower memory consumption.</p></details> |  |
| **[Implicit Reasoning in Deep Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10840v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, time series foundation models have shown promising zero-shot forecasting performance on time series from a wide range of domains. However, it remains unclear whether their success stems from a true understanding of temporal dynamics or simply from memorizing the training data. While implicit reasoning in language models has been studied, similar evaluations for time series models have been largely unexplored. This work takes an initial step toward assessing the reasoning abilities of deep time series forecasting models. We find that certain linear, MLP-based, and patch-based Transformer models generalize effectively in systematically orchestrated out-of-distribution scenarios, suggesting underexplored reasoning capabilities beyond simple pattern memorization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast and Post-Quantum Authentication for Real-time Next Generation Networks with Bloom Filter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10813v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale next-generation networked systems like smart grids and vehicular networks facilitate extensive automation and autonomy through real-time communication of sensitive messages. Digital signatures are vital for such applications since they offer scalable broadcast authentication with non-repudiation. Yet, even conventional secure signatures (e.g., ECDSA, RSA) introduce significant cryptographic delays that can disrupt the safety of such delay-aware systems. With the rise of quantum computers breaking conventional intractability problems, these traditional cryptosystems must be replaced with post-quantum (PQ) secure ones. However, PQ-secure signatures are significantly costlier than their conventional counterparts, vastly exacerbating delay hurdles for real-time applications. We propose a new signature called Time Valid Probabilistic Data Structure HORS (TVPD-HORS) that achieves significantly lower end-to-end delay with a tunable PQ-security for real-time applications. We harness special probabilistic data structures as an efficient one-way function at the heart of our novelty, thereby vastly fastening HORS as a primitive for NIST PQ cryptography standards. TVPD-HORS permits tunable and fast processing for varying input sizes via One-hash Bloom Filter, excelling in time valid cases, wherein authentication with shorter security parameters is used for short-lived yet safety-critical messages. We show that TVPD-HORS verification is 2.7x and 5x faster than HORS in high-security and time valid settings, respectively. TVPD-HORS key generation is also faster, with a similar signing speed to HORS. Moreover, TVPD-HORS can increase the speed of HORS variants over a magnitude of time. These features make TVPD-HORS an ideal primitive to raise high-speed time valid versions of PQ-safe standards like XMSS and SPHINCS+, paving the way for real-time authentication of next-generation networks.</p></details> |  |

Although recent studies have highlighted the efficacy of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication techniques in autonomous driving, a significant challenge persists: how to efficiently integrate multiple high-bandwidth features across an expanding network of connected agents such as vehicles and infrastructure. In this paper, we introduce CoMamba, a novel cooperative 3D detection framework designed to leverage state-space models for real-time onboard vehicle perception. Compared to prior state-of-the-art transformer-based models, CoMamba enjoys being a more scalable 3D model using bidirectional state space models, bypassing the quadratic complexity pain-point of attention mechanisms. Through extensive experimentation on V2X/V2V datasets, CoMamba achieves superior performance compared to existing methods while maintaining real-time processing capabilities. The proposed framework not only enhances object detection accuracy but also significantly reduces processing time, making it a promising solution for next-generation cooperative perception systems in intelligent transportation networks.</p></details> |  |

Despite that, accurately estimating domains of attraction for nonlinear systems remains a challenging task, where available estimation approaches are either conservative or limited to low-dimensional systems. In this work, we propose an iterative approach to accurately underapproximate safe (i.e., state-constrained) domains of attraction for general discrete-time autonomous nonlinear systems. Our approach relies on implicit representations of safe backward reachable sets of safe regions of attraction, where such regions can be be easily constructed using, e.g., quadratic Lyapunov functions. The iterations of our approach are monotonic (in the sense of set inclusion), where each iteration results in a safe region of attraction, given as a sublevel set, that underapproximates the safe domain of attraction. The sublevel set representations of the resulting regions of attraction can be efficiently utilized in verifying the inclusion of given points of interest in the safe domain of attraction. We illustrate our approach through two numerical examples, involving two- and four-dimensional nonlinear systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bipartite causal inference with interference, time series data, and a random network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04775v2)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In bipartite causal inference with interference there are two distinct sets of units: those that receive the treatment, termed interventional units, and those on which the outcome is measured, termed outcome units. Which interventional units' treatment can drive which outcome units' outcomes is often depicted in a bipartite network. We study bipartite causal inference with interference from observational data across time and with a changing bipartite network. Under an exposure mapping framework, we define causal effects specific to each outcome unit, representing average contrasts of potential outcomes across time. We establish unconfoundedness of the exposure received by the outcome units based on unconfoundedness assumptions on the interventional units' treatment assignment and the random graph, hence respecting the bipartite structure of the problem. By harvesting the time component of our setting, causal effects are estimable while controlling only for temporal trends and time-varying confounders. Our results hold for binary, continuous, and multivariate exposure mappings. In the case of a binary exposure, we propose three matching algorithms to estimate the causal effect based on matching exposed to unexposed time periods for the same outcome unit, and we show that the bias of the resulting estimators is bounded. We illustrate our approach with an extensive simulation study and an application on the effect of wildfire smoke on transportation by bicycle.</p></details> |  |

This task presents significant challenges due to the complex dynamics of DLOs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes differentiable Discrete Elastic Rods For deformable linear Objects with Real-time Modeling (DEFORM), a novel framework that combines a differentiable physics-based model with a learning framework to model DLOs accurately and in real-time. The performance of DEFORM is evaluated in an experimental setup involving two industrial robots and a variety of sensors. A comprehensive series of experiments demonstrate the efficacy of DEFORM in terms of accuracy, computational speed, and generalizability when compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. To further demonstrate the utility of DEFORM, this paper integrates it into a perception pipeline and illustrates its superior performance when compared to the state-of-the-art methods while tracking a DLO even in the presence of occlusions. Finally, this paper illustrates the superior performance of DEFORM when compared to state-of-the-art methods when it is applied to perform autonomous planning and control of DLOs.

We seek to minimize the expected terminal (mission) time, which is an essential capability for planetary exploration missions where ground rovers have to carry out scientific tasks efficiently within the mission timelines in uncertain environments. Our main contribution is to convert the underlying stochastic optimal control problem into a deterministic, numerically tractable, optimal control problem. To this end, the proposed solution framework combines two strategies from previous methods: i) a partial model predictive control with consensus horizon approach and ii) a sum-of-norm cost, a temporally strictly increasing weighted-norm, promoting minimum-time trajectories. Our contribution is to adopt these formulations into an SCP solution framework and obtain a numerically tractable stochastic control algorithm. We then demonstrate the resulting control method in multiple applications: i) a closed-loop linear system as a representative result (a spacecraft double integrator model), ii) an open-loop linear system (the same model), and then iii) a nonlinear system (Dubin's car).</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for CDC 2024</p></details> |

However, this introduces the complexities of numerical derivatives into the training process of these models. In this study, we propose modifying the structure of the traditional RNN to enable the prediction of each block over a time interval, making it possible to calculate the derivative of the output with respect to time using the backpropagation algorithm. To achieve this, the time intervals of these blocks are overlapped, defining a mutual loss function between them. Additionally, the employment of conditional hidden states enables us to achieve a unique solution for each block. The forget factor is utilized to control the influence of the conditional hidden state on the prediction of the subsequent block. This new model, termed the Mutual Interval RNN (MI-RNN), is applied to solve three different benchmarks: the Burgers equation, unsteady heat conduction in an irregular domain, and the Green vortex problem. Our results demonstrate that MI-RNN can find the exact solution more accurately compared to existing RNN models. For instance, in the second problem, MI-RNN achieved one order of magnitude less relative error compared to the RNN model with numerical derivatives.</p></details> |  |

In execution-time opacity, the attacker aims at deducing whether a private location was visited, by observing only the execution time. It can be decided whether a TA is opaque in this setting. In this work, we tackle control, and show that we are able to decide whether a TA can be controlled at runtime to ensure opacity. Our method is constructive, in the sense that we can exhibit such a controller. We also address the case when the attacker cannot have an infinite precision in its observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author (and extended) version of the manuscript of the same name published in the proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Software Engineering and Formal Methods ({SEFM} 2024)</p></details> |

However, real-time relighting is challenging due to high computation cost of the rendering equation which requires shape and material decomposition and visibility test to model shadow. Additionally, for indirect illumination, additional computation of rendering equation on each secondary surface point (where reflection occurs) is required rendering real-time relighting challenging. We propose a novel method that executes a CNN renderer to compute primary surface points and rendering parameters, required for direct illumination. We also present a lightweight hash grid-based renderer, for indirect illumination, which is recursively executed to perform the secondary ray tracing process. Both renderers are trained in a distillation from a pre-trained teacher model and provide real-time physically-based rendering under unseen lighting condition at a negligible loss of rendering quality.</p></details> | Under review |

This work introduces a consistent parallel trajectory optimization (CPTO) approach to enable safe and consistent driving in dense obstacle environments with perception uncertainties. Utilizing discrete-time barrier function theory, we develop a consensus safety barrier module that ensures reliable safety coverage within the spatiotemporal trajectory space across potential obstacle configurations. Following this, a bi-convex parallel trajectory optimization problem is derived that facilitates decomposition into a series of low-dimensional quadratic programming problems to accelerate computation. By leveraging the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for parallel optimization, each generated candidate trajectory corresponds to a possible environment configuration while sharing a common consensus trajectory segment. This ensures driving safety and consistency when executing the consensus trajectory segment for the ego vehicle in real time. We validate our CPTO framework through extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines across multiple driving tasks in partially observable environments. Our results demonstrate improved safety and consistency using both synthetic and real-world traffic datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[bayesCureRateModel: Bayesian Cure Rate Modeling for Time to Event Data in R](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10221v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The family of cure models provides a unique opportunity to simultaneously model both the proportion of cured subjects (those not facing the event of interest) and the distribution function of time-to-event for susceptibles (those facing the event). In practice, the application of cure models is mainly facilitated by the availability of various R packages. However, most of these packages primarily focus on the mixture or promotion time cure rate model. This article presents a fully Bayesian approach implemented in R to estimate a general family of cure rate models in the presence of covariates. It builds upon the work by Papastamoulis and Milienos (2024) by additionally considering various options for describing the promotion time, including the Weibull, exponential, Gompertz, log-logistic and finite mixtures of gamma distributions, among others. Moreover, the user can choose any proper distribution function for modeling the promotion time (provided that some specific conditions are met). Posterior inference is carried out by constructing a Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler, which combines Gibbs sampling for the latent cure indicators and Metropolis-Hastings steps with Langevin diffusion dynamics for parameter updates. The main MCMC algorithm is embedded within a parallel tempering scheme by considering heated versions of the target posterior distribution. The package is illustrated on a real dataset analyzing the duration of the first marriage under the presence of various covariates such as the race, age and the presence of kids.</p></details> | 34 pages, 7 figures |

While it may seem ambitious, a careful examination shows it is both feasible and beneficial for the DNS system. The mechanism called "DNS Real-time Update" (DNSRU), a service that facilitates real-time and secure updates of cached domain records in DNS resolvers worldwide, even before the expiration of the corresponding Time To Live (TTL) values. This service allows Internet domain owners to quickly rectify any erroneous global IP address distribution, even if a long TTL value is associated with it. By addressing this critical DNS high availability issue, DNSRU eliminates the need for short TTL values and their associated drawbacks. Therefore, DNSRU DNSRU reduces the traffic load on authoritative servers while enhancing the system's fault tolerance. In this paper we show that our DNSRU design is backward compatible, supports gradual deployment, secure, efficient, and feasible.</p></details> |  |

However, they usually require GPUs to operate in real-time. Therefore, this paper proposes an open-source real-time dynamic SLAM system that runs solely on CPU by incorporating a mask prediction mechanism, which allows the deep learning method and the camera tracking to run entirely in parallel at different frequencies. Our SLAM system further introduces a dual-stage optical flow tracking approach and employs a hybrid usage of optical flow and ORB features, enhancing efficiency and robustness by selectively allocating computational resources to input frames. Compared with previous methods, our system maintains high localization accuracy in dynamic environments while achieving a tracking frame rate of 56 FPS on a laptop CPU, proving that deep learning methods are feasible for dynamic SLAM without GPU support. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first SLAM system to achieve this.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

A crucial assumption in this paper is time-modulated material parameters. We prove a so-called capacitance matrix approximation of the wave equation in the form of an ordinary differential equation. These formulas set the ground for the derivation of a first-principles characterisation of localised modes in terms of the generalised capacitance matrix. Furthermore, we provide numerical results supporting our analytical results showing for the first time the phenomenon of space-time localised waves in a perturbed time-modulated metamaterial. Such spatio-temporal localisation is only possible in the presence of subwavelength resonances in the unperturbed structure. We introduce the time-dependent degree of localisation to quantitatively determine the localised modes and provide a variety of numerical experiments to illustrate our formulations and results.</p></details> | 23 pages, 6 figures |

However, these models often face issues such as slow inference speeds, reliance on complex pre-trained neural codec representations, and difficulties in achieving naturalness and high similarity to reference speakers. To address these challenges, this work introduces StyleTTS-ZS, an efficient zero-shot TTS model that leverages distilled time-varying style diffusion to capture diverse speaker identities and prosodies. We propose a novel approach that represents human speech using input text and fixed-length time-varying discrete style codes to capture diverse prosodic variations, trained adversarially with multi-modal discriminators. A diffusion model is then built to sample this time-varying style code for efficient latent diffusion. Using classifier-free guidance, StyleTTS-ZS achieves high similarity to the reference speaker in the style diffusion process. Furthermore, to expedite sampling, the style diffusion model is distilled with perceptual loss using only 10k samples, maintaining speech quality and similarity while reducing inference speed by 90%. Our model surpasses previous state-of-the-art large-scale zero-shot TTS models in both naturalness and similarity, offering a 10-20 faster sampling speed, making it an attractive alternative for efficient large-scale zero-shot TTS systems.

The proposed approach leverages measured data acquired through an input-output observation, referred to as a single trajectory, collected over a specified time horizon. By fulfilling a certain rank condition, which ensures the unknown system is persistently excited by the collected data, we design a CBC and its corresponding safety controller directly from the finite-length observed data, without explicitly identifying the unknown dynamical system. This is achieved through proposing a data-based sum-of-squares optimization (SOS) program to systematically design CBCs and their safety controllers. We validate our data-driven approach over two physical case studies including a jet engine and a Lorenz system, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

This is achieved with a novel representation of the dynamic footstep planning problem, where each point in the environment is considered a potential foothold that can apply a force to the center of mass to keep it on a desired trajectory. For a biped, up to two such footholds per time step must be selected, and we approximate this cardinality constraint with an iteratively reweighted $l_1$-norm minimization. Along with a linearizing approximation of an angular momentum constraint, this results in a quadratic program can be solved for a contact schedule and center of mass trajectory with automatic gait discovery. A 2 s planning horizon with 13 time steps and 20 surfaces available at each time is solved in 142 ms, roughly ten times faster than comparable existing methods in the literature.

The use of this method to simulate high stiff problems associated with reactions occurring in a multicomponent medium requires the use of the adaptive change in the time step. The solution of the classical problem related to the formation and propagation of a ZND detonation wave is carried out.

To achieve the accurate imputation of these missing values, exploiting inter-correlation by employing the relationships between sequences (i.e., a network) is as important as the use of temporal dependency, since a sequence normally correlates with other sequences. Moreover, exploiting an adequate network depending on time is also necessary since the network varies over time. However, in real-world scenarios, we normally know neither the network structure nor when the network changes beforehand. Here, we propose a missing value imputation method for multivariate time series, namely MissNet, that is designed to exploit temporal dependency with a state-space model and inter-correlation by switching sparse networks. The network encodes conditional independence between features, which helps us understand the important relationships for imputation visually. Our algorithm, which scales linearly with reference to the length of the data, alternatively infers networks and fills in missing values using the networks while discovering the switching of the networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MissNet outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms for multivariate time series imputation and provides interpretable results.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2024 |

The presented numerical method does not use any ideas of splitting or fractional time steps methods. The modification of the LST-DG predictor has been developed, based on a local partition of the time step in cells in which strong reactivity of the medium is observed. This approach made it possible to obtain solutions to classical problems of flows with detonation waves and strong stiffness, without significantly decreasing the time step. The results obtained show the very high applicability and efficiency of using the ADER-DG-PN method with a posteriori sub-cell limiting for simulating reactive flows with detonation waves. The numerical solution shows the correct formation and propagation of ZND detonation waves. The structure of detonation waves is resolved by this numerical method with subcell resolution even on coarse spatial meshes. The smooth components of the numerical solution are correctly and very accurately reproduced by the numerical method. Non-physical artifacts of the numerical solution, typical for problems with detonation waves, such as the propagation of non-physical shock waves and weak detonation fronts ahead of the main detonation front, did not arise in the results obtained. The results of simulating rather complex problems associated with the propagation of detonation waves in significantly inhomogeneous domains are presented, which show that all the main features of detonation flows are correctly reproduced by this numerical method. It can be concluded that the space-time adaptive ADER-DG-PN method with a posteriori sub-cell ADER-WENO finite-volume limiting is perfectly applicable to simulating complex reacting flows with detonation waves.</p></details> | <details><summary>52 pa...</summary><p>52 pages, 36 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Among these approaches, a noteworthy concept is that of concurrent conceptual and control design or co-design. This approach involves the tuning of feedforward and/or feedback control strategies in conjunction with the conceptual design of the dynamic system. The primary aim is to discover integrated solutions that surpass those attainable through a disjointed or decoupled approach. This concurrent design paradigm exhibits particular promise in the context of hybrid unmanned aerial systems (UASs), such as tail-sitters, where the objectives of versatility (driven by control considerations) and efficiency (influenced by conceptual design) often present conflicting demands. Nevertheless, a persistent challenge lies in the potential disparity between the theoretical models that underpin the design process and the real-world operational environment, the so-called reality gap. Such disparities can lead to suboptimal performance when the designed system is deployed in reality. To address this issue, this paper introduces DAIMYO, a novel design architecture that incorporates a high-fidelity environment, which emulates real-world conditions, into the procedure in pursuit of a `first-time-right' design. The outcome of this innovative approach is a design procedure that yields versatile and efficient UAS designs capable of withstanding the challenges posed by the reality gap.</p></details> |  |

Local processing and learning of time-series information typically demand intensive computations and massive storage as the process involves retrieving information and tuning hundreds of parameters back in time. In this work, we developed a memristor-based echo state network accelerator that features efficient temporal data processing and in-situ online learning. The proposed design is benchmarked using various datasets involving real-world tasks, such as forecasting the load energy consumption and weather conditions. The experimental results illustrate that the hardware model experiences a marginal degradation in performance as compared to the software counterpart. This is mainly attributed to the limited precision and dynamic range of network parameters when emulated using memristor devices. The proposed system is evaluated for lifespan, robustness, and energy-delay product. It is observed that the system demonstrates reasonable robustness for device failure below 10%, which may occur due to stuck-at faults. Furthermore, 247X reduction in energy consumption is achieved when compared to a custom CMOS digital design implemented at the same technology node.</p></details> |  |
| **[DARDA: Domain-Aware Real-Time Dynamic Neural Network Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09753v1)** | 2024-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a practical solution to mitigate the performance degradation of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in the presence of corruption/ noise affecting inputs. Existing approaches in TTA continuously adapt the DNN, leading to excessive resource consumption and performance degradation due to accumulation of error stemming from lack of supervision. In this work, we propose Domain-Aware Real-Time Dynamic Adaptation (DARDA) to address such issues. Our key approach is to proactively learn latent representations of some corruption types, each one associated with a sub-network state tailored to correctly classify inputs affected by that corruption. After deployment, DARDA adapts the DNN to previously unseen corruptions in an unsupervised fashion by (i) estimating the latent representation of the ongoing corruption; (ii) selecting the sub-network whose associated corruption is the closest in the latent space to the ongoing corruption; and (iii) adapting DNN state, so that its representation matches the ongoing corruption. This way, DARDA is more resource efficient and can swiftly adapt to new distributions caused by different corruptions without requiring a large variety of input data. Through experiments with two popular mobile edge devices - Raspberry Pi and NVIDIA Jetson Nano - we show that DARDA reduces energy consumption and average cache memory footprint respectively by 1.74x and 2.64x with respect to the state of the art, while increasing the performance by 10.4%, 5.7% and 4.4% on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and TinyImagenet.</p></details> |  |

Different tasks arise, such as regression, classification or segmentation of the time series. However, to reliably solve these challenges, it is important to filter out abnormal observations that deviate from the usual behavior of the time series. While many anomaly detection methods exist for independent data and stationary time series, these methods are not applicable to non-stationary time series. To allow for non-stationarity in the data, while simultaneously detecting anomalies, we propose OML-AD, a novel approach for anomaly detection (AD) based on online machine learning (OML). We provide an implementation of OML-AD within the Python library River and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[SITSMamba for Crop Classification based on Satellite Image Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09673v1)** | 2024-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satellite image time series (SITS) data provides continuous observations over time, allowing for the tracking of vegetation changes and growth patterns throughout the seasons and years. Numerous deep learning (DL) approaches using SITS for crop classification have emerged recently, with the latest approaches adopting Transformer for SITS classification. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention in Transformer poses challenges for classifying long time series. While the cutting-edge Mamba architecture has demonstrated strength in various domains, including remote sensing image interpretation, its capacity to learn temporal representations in SITS data remains unexplored. Moreover, the existing SITS classification methods often depend solely on crop labels as supervision signals, which fails to fully exploit the temporal information. In this paper, we proposed a Satellite Image Time Series Mamba (SITSMamba) method for crop classification based on remote sensing time series data. The proposed SITSMamba contains a spatial encoder based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and a Mamba-based temporal encoder. To exploit richer temporal information from SITS, we design two branches of decoder used for different tasks. The first branch is a crop Classification Branch (CBranch), which includes a ConvBlock to decode the feature to a crop map. The second branch is a SITS Reconstruction Branch that uses a Linear layer to transform the encoded feature to predict the original input values. Furthermore, we design a Positional Weight (PW) applied to the RBranch to help the model learn rich latent knowledge from SITS. We also design two weighting factors to control the balance of the two branches during training. The code of SITSMamba is available at: https://github.com/XiaoleiQinn/SITSMamba.</p></details> |  |

Recently, deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in time series classification. However, they often require large expert-labeled training datasets which can be infeasible in practice. In few-shot settings, i.e. only a limited number of samples per class are available in training data, DNNs show a significant drop in testing accuracy and poor generalization ability. In this paper, we propose to address these problems from an optimization and a loss function perspective. Specifically, we propose a new learning framework named COSCO consisting of a sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) optimization and a Prototypical loss function to improve the generalization ability of DNN for multivariate time series classification problems under few-shot setting. Our experiments demonstrate our proposed method outperforms the existing baseline methods.

| **[A clustering adaptive Gaussian process regression method: response patterns based real-time prediction for nonlinear solid mechanics problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10572v1)** | 2024-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerical simulation is powerful to study nonlinear solid mechanics problems. However, mesh-based or particle-based numerical methods suffer from the common shortcoming of being time-consuming, particularly for complex problems with real-time analysis requirements. This study presents a clustering adaptive Gaussian process regression (CAG) method aiming for real-time prediction for nonlinear structural responses in solid mechanics. It is a data-driven machine learning method featuring a small sample size, high accuracy, and high efficiency, leveraging nonlinear structural response patterns. Similar to the traditional Gaussian process regression (GPR) method, it operates in offline and online stages. In the offline stage, an adaptive sample generation technique is introduced to cluster datasets into distinct patterns for demand-driven sample allocation. This ensures comprehensive coverage of the critical samples for the solution space of interest. In the online stage, following the divide-and-conquer strategy, a pre-prediction classification categorizes problems into predefined patterns sequentially predicted by the trained multi-pattern Gaussian process regressor. In addition, dimension reduction and restoration techniques are employed in the proposed method to enhance its efficiency. A set of problems involving material, geometric, and boundary condition nonlinearities is presented to demonstrate the CAG method's abilities. The proposed method can offer predictions within a second and attain high precision with only about 20 samples within the context of this study, outperforming the traditional GPR using uniformly distributed samples for error reductions ranging from 1 to 3 orders of magnitude. The CAG method is expected to offer a powerful tool for real-time prediction of nonlinear solid mechanical problems and shed light on the complex nonlinear structural response pattern.</p></details> |  |

We propose Pathformer, a multi-scale Transformer with adaptive pathways. It integrates both temporal resolution and temporal distance for multi-scale modeling. Multi-scale division divides the time series into different temporal resolutions using patches of various sizes. Based on the division of each scale, dual attention is performed over these patches to capture global correlations and local details as temporal dependencies. We further enrich the multi-scale Transformer with adaptive pathways, which adaptively adjust the multi-scale modeling process based on the varying temporal dynamics of the input, improving the accuracy and generalization of Pathformer. Extensive experiments on eleven real-world datasets demonstrate that Pathformer not only achieves state-of-the-art performance by surpassing all current models but also exhibits stronger generalization abilities under various transfer scenarios.

Open-World Test-Time Training (OWTTT) addresses the challenge of generalizing deep learning models to unknown target domain distributions, especially in the presence of strong Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. Existing TTT methods often struggle to maintain performance when confronted with strong OOD data. In OWTTT, the focus has predominantly been on distinguishing between overall strong and weak OOD data. However, during the early stages of TTT, initial feature extraction is hampered by interference from strong OOD and corruptions, resulting in diminished contrast and premature classification of certain classes as strong OOD. To address this, we introduce Open World Dynamic Contrastive Learning (OWDCL), an innovative approach that utilizes contrastive learning to augment positive sample pairs. This strategy not only bolsters contrast in the early stages but also significantly enhances model robustness in subsequent stages. In comparison datasets, our OWDCL model has produced the most advanced performance.</p></details> | 10page |

Recently, a cycle specified queuing and forwarding (CSQF) scheme has been advocated to enhance the Ethernet. However, CSQF only outlines a foundational equipment-level primitive, while how to attain network-wide flow scheduling is not yet determined. Prior endeavors primarily focus on the range of a local area, rendering them unsuitable for long-distance factory interconnection. This paper devises the cycle tags planning (CTP) mechanism, the first integer programming model for the CSQF, which makes the CSQF practical for efficient global flow scheduling. In the CTP model, the per-hop cycle alignment problem is solved by decoupling the long-distance link delay from cyclic queuing time. To avoid queue overflows, we discretize the underlying network resources into cycle-related queue resource blocks and detail the core constraints within multiple periods. Then, two heuristic algorithms named flow offset and cycle shift (FO-CS) and Tabu FO-CS are designed to calculate the flows' cycle tags and maximize the number of schedulable flows, respectively. Evaluation results show that FO-CS increases the number of scheduled flows by 31.2%. The Tabu FO-CS algorithm can schedule 94.45% of flows at the level of 2000 flows.</p></details> |  |

The proposed model incorporates quantile Fourier regression for load fitting, leading to a large-scale optimization problem with approximately a million decision variables and constraints. To address this complexity, the problem is formulated as a linear program and solved using a commercial solver, ensuring effective navigation and identification of optimal solutions. The model's performance is evaluated by considering different pricing policies and scenarios, including demand peak shaving. Validation of the Markov model is conducted using one year of historical demand data from a school. Findings indicate that MDP performance in adapting to uncertain loads can range from 30 to 99% depending on the pricing policy.</p></details> |  |

Counterfactual explanations, which provide insights by presenting alternative inputs that change model predictions, offer a promising solution. However, existing methods for generating counterfactual explanations for time-series data often struggle with balancing key objectives like proximity, sparsity, and validity. In this paper, we introduce TX-Gen, a novel algorithm for generating counterfactual explanations based on the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). TX-Gen leverages evolutionary multi-objective optimization to find a diverse set of counterfactuals that are both sparse and valid, while maintaining minimal dissimilarity to the original time series. By incorporating a flexible reference-guided mechanism, our method improves the plausibility and interpretability of the counterfactuals without relying on predefined assumptions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TX-Gen outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality counterfactuals, making time-series models more transparent and interpretable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |

However, they are also the target of malevolent human actions, especially in countries having experienced inner turmoil and conflicts. Because monitoring these sites from space is a key step towards their preservation, we introduce the DAFA Looted Sites dataset, \datasetname, a labeled multi-temporal remote sensing dataset containing 55,480 images acquired monthly over 8 years across 675 Afghan archaeological sites, including 135 sites looted during the acquisition period. \datasetname~is particularly challenging because of the limited number of training samples, the class imbalance, the weak binary annotations only available at the level of the time series, and the subtlety of relevant changes coupled with important irrelevant ones over a long time period. It is also an interesting playground to assess the performance of satellite image time series (SITS) classification methods on a real and important use case. We evaluate a large set of baselines, outline the substantial benefits of using foundation models and show the additional boost that can be provided by using complete time series instead of using a single image.</p></details> |  |

We present a user-aware robotic system that adapts to operator behavior in real time while non-intrusively monitoring physiological signals to create a more responsive and empathetic environment. Our prototype dynamically adjusts robot speed and movement patterns while measuring operator pupil dilation and proximity. Our user study compares this adaptive system to a non-adaptive counterpart, and demonstrates that the adaptive system significantly reduces both perceived and physiologically measured cognitive load while enhancing usability. Participants reported increased feelings of comfort, safety, trust, and a stronger sense of collaboration when working with the adaptive robot. This highlights the potential of integrating real-time physiological data into human-robot interaction paradigms. This novel approach creates more intuitive and collaborative industrial environments where robots effectively 'read' and respond to human cognitive states, and we feature all data and code for future use.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |

In order to be both effective and practical, the design of a performance test must achieve a reasonable trade-off between result quality and testing time. This becomes particularly challenging in Java context, where the software undergoes a warm-up phase of execution, due to just-in-time compilation. During this phase, performance measurements are subject to severe fluctuations, which may adversely affect quality of performance test results. However, these approaches often provide suboptimal estimates of the warm-up phase, resulting in either insufficient or excessive warm-up iterations, which may degrade result quality or increase testing time. There is still a lack of consensus on how to properly address this problem. Here, we propose and study an AI-based framework to dynamically halt warm-up iterations at runtime. Specifically, our framework leverages recent advances in AI for Time Series Classification (TSC) to predict the end of the warm-up phase during test execution. We conduct experiments by training three different TSC models on half a million of measurement segments obtained from JMH microbenchmark executions. We find that our framework significantly improves the accuracy of the warm-up estimates provided by state-of-practice and state-of-the-art methods. This higher estimation accuracy results in a net improvement in either result quality or testing time for up to +35.3% of the microbenchmarks. Our study highlights that integrating AI to dynamically estimate the end of the warm-up phase can enhance the cost-effectiveness of Java performance testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in The 39th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE '24)</p></details> |
| **[Weather Prediction Using CNN-LSTM for Time Series Analysis: A Case Study on Delhi Temperature Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09414v1)** | 2024-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As global climate change intensifies, accurate weather forecasting is increasingly crucial for sectors such as agriculture, energy management, and environmental protection. Traditional methods, which rely on physical and statistical models, often struggle with complex, nonlinear, and time-varying data, underscoring the need for more advanced techniques. This study explores a hybrid CNN-LSTM model to enhance temperature forecasting accuracy for the Delhi region, using historical meteorological data from 1996 to 2017. We employed both direct and indirect methods, including comprehensive data preprocessing and exploratory analysis, to construct and train our model. The CNN component effectively extracts spatial features, while the LSTM captures temporal dependencies, leading to improved prediction accuracy. Experimental results indicate that the CNN-LSTM model significantly outperforms traditional forecasting methods in terms of both accuracy and stability, with a mean square error (MSE) of 3.26217 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.80615. The hybrid model demonstrates its potential as a robust tool for temperature prediction, offering valuable insights for meteorological forecasting and related fields. Future research should focus on optimizing model architecture, exploring additional feature extraction techniques, and addressing challenges such as overfitting and computational complexity. This approach not only advances temperature forecasting but also provides a foundation for applying deep learning to other time series forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[MotionTTT: 2D Test-Time-Training Motion Estimation for 3D Motion Corrected MRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09370v1)** | 2024-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major challenge of the long measurement times in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an important medical imaging technology, is that patients may move during data acquisition. This leads to severe motion artifacts in the reconstructed images and volumes. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based test-time-training method for accurate motion estimation. The key idea is that a neural network trained for motion-free reconstruction has a small loss if there is no motion, thus optimizing over motion parameters passed through the reconstruction network enables accurate estimation of motion. The estimated motion parameters enable to correct for the motion and to reconstruct accurate motion-corrected images. Our method uses 2D reconstruction networks to estimate rigid motion in 3D, and constitutes the first deep learning based method for 3D rigid motion estimation towards 3D-motion-corrected MRI. We show that our method can provably reconstruct motion parameters for a simple signal and neural network model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for both retrospectively simulated motion and prospectively collected real motion-corrupted data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor Time Series Imputation through Tensor Factor Modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13153v2)** | 2024-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose tensor time series imputation when the missing pattern in the tensor data can be general, as long as any two data positions along a tensor fibre are both observed for enough time points. The method is based on a tensor time series factor model with Tucker decomposition of the common component. One distinguished feature of the tensor time series factor model used is that there can be weak factors in the factor loadings matrix for each mode. This reflects reality better when real data can have weak factors which drive only groups of observed variables, for instance, a sector factor in financial market driving only stocks in a particular sector. Using the data with missing entries, asymptotic normality is derived for rows of estimated factor loadings, while consistent covariance matrix estimation enables us to carry out inferences. As a first in the literature, we also propose a ratio-based estimator for the rank of the core tensor under general missing patterns. Rates of convergence are spelt out for the imputations from the estimated tensor factor models. Simulation results show that our imputation procedure works well, with asymptotic normality and corresponding inferences also demonstrated. Re-imputation performances are also gauged when we demonstrate that using slightly larger rank then estimated gives superior re-imputation performances. A Fama-French portfolio example with matrix returns and an OECD data example with matrix of Economic indicators are presented and analyzed, showing the efficacy of our imputation approach compared to direct vector imputation.</p></details> | 78 pages, 13 figures |

However, the theoretical foundation of multi-objective EAs (MOEAs), particularly the fundamental aspects like running time analysis, remains largely underexplored. Existing theoretical studies mainly focus on basic MOEAs, with little attention given to practical MOEAs. In this paper, we present a running time analysis of strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm 2 (SPEA2) for the first time. Specifically, we prove that the expected running time of SPEA2 for solving three commonly used multi-objective problems, i.e., $m$OneMinMax, $m$LeadingOnesTrailingZeroes, and $m$-OneJumpZeroJump, is $O(\mu n\cdot \min\{m\log n, n\})$, $O(\mu n^2)$, and $O(\mu n^k \cdot \min\{mn, 3^{m/2}\})$, respectively. Here $m$ denotes the number of objectives, and the population size $\mu$ is required to be at least $(2n/m+1)^{m/2}$, $(2n/m+1)^{m-1}$ and $(2n/m-2k+3)^{m/2}$, respectively. The proofs are accomplished through general theorems which are also applicable for analyzing the expected running time of other MOEAs on these problems, and thus can be helpful for future theoretical analysis of MOEAs.</p></details> |  |

Our goal is to present a unified framework for calculating the probabilistic reachable set of discrete-time systems in the presence of both deterministic input and stochastic noise. By adopting a suitable separation strategy, the probabilistic reachable set is decoupled into a deterministic reachable set and the effect of the stochastic noise. To capture the effect of the stochastic noise, in particular sub-Gaussian noise, we provide a probabilistic bound on the distance between a stochastic trajectory and its deterministic counterpart. The key to our approach is a novel energy function called the Averaged Moment Generating Function, which we leverage to provide a high probability bound on this distance. We show that this probabilistic bound is tight for a large class of discrete-time nonlinear stochastic systems and is exact for linear stochastic dynamics. By combining this tight probabilistic bound with the existing methods for deterministic reachability analysis, we propose a flexible framework that can efficiently compute probabilistic reachable sets of stochastic systems. We also provide two case studies for applying our framework to Lipschitz bound reachability and interval-based reachability. Three numerical experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical results.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2407.12225</p></details> |

Recently, adaptive control systems with relaxed persistent excitation (PE) conditions have been proposed to solve this problem; however, most discussions have focused on continuous-time systems. In this study, we propose a novel adaptive control method for discrete-time systems with disturbances that combines directional forgetting and concurrent learning. The proposed method does not require the PE condition, information on disturbances, unknown parameters, or matching conditions, and it guarantees exponential uniform ultimate unbounded (UUB). It was also theoretically demonstrated that the upper bound of the UUB can be designed based on the forgetting factor, which is a design parameter. Numerical simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | 6 pages, 1 figure |

Load imbalance is one performance issue that can prejudice parallel applications from exploiting the computational power of these platforms. Ondes3D is a scientific application for seismic wave simulation used to assess the geological impact of earthquakes. Its parallelism relies on applying a regular domain decomposition in the geological domain provided and distributing each sub-domain to MPI ranks. Previous works investigate the significant spatial and temporal imbalance in Ondes3D and suggest new parallelization and load balancing techniques to minimize them. However, none explored its execution on different architectures. Our paper evaluates the performance of Ondes3D for two earthquake scenarios on eight different multicore architectures, including Intel, AMD, and ARM processors. We measure the load distribution per MPI rank, evaluate the temporal load imbalance, and compare the execution of the application's kernels. Our results show that the temporal load imbalance in Ondes3D depends on the architecture chosen, with some platforms minimizing such imbalance more effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 2...</summary><p>The 2020 International Conference on High Performance Computing and Simulation (HPCS 2020)</p></details> |

However, the challenge of acquiring paired videos for dynamic scenes hampers the practical deployment of deep video denoising techniques. In contrast, this obstacle is less pronounced in image denoising, where paired data is more readily available. Thus, a well-trained image denoiser could serve as a reliable spatial prior for video denoising. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised video denoising framework, named ``Temporal As a Plugin'' (TAP), which integrates tunable temporal modules into a pre-trained image denoiser. By incorporating temporal modules, our method can harness temporal information across noisy frames, complementing its power of spatial denoising. Furthermore, we introduce a progressive fine-tuning strategy that refines each temporal module using the generated pseudo clean video frames, progressively enhancing the network's denoising performance. Compared to other unsupervised video denoising methods, our framework demonstrates superior performance on both sRGB and raw video denoising datasets.</p></details> |  |

Current MOT trackers rely on accurate object detection results and precise matching of target reidentification (ReID). These methods focus on optimizing target spatial attributes while overlooking temporal cues in modelling object relationships, especially for challenging tracking conditions such as object deformation and blurring, etc. To address the above-mentioned issues, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Cohesion Multiple Object Tracking framework (STCMOT), which utilizes historical embedding features to model the representation of ReID and detection features in a sequential order. Concretely, a temporal embedding boosting module is introduced to enhance the discriminability of individual embedding based on adjacent frame cooperation. While the trajectory embedding is then propagated by a temporal detection refinement module to mine salient target locations in the temporal field. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone2019 and UAVDT datasets demonstrate our STCMOT sets a new state-of-the-art performance in MOTA and IDF1 metrics.

This paper presents a registry-based, multi-layer and temporal network of the entire Danish population in the years 2008-2021 (roughly 7.2 mill. individuals). Our network maps the relationships formed through family, households, neighborhoods, colleagues and classmates. We outline key properties of this multiplex network, introducing both an individual-focused perspective as well as a bipartite representation. We show how to aggregate and combine the layers, and how to efficiently compute network measures such as shortest paths in large administrative networks. Our analysis reveals how past connections reappear later in other layers, that the number of relationships aggregated over time reflects the position in the income distribution, and that we can recover canonical shortest path length distributions when appropriately weighting connections. Along with the network data, we release a Python package that uses the bipartite network representation for efficient analysis.</p></details> |  |

This critical issue, rooted in the inherent complexity of both DNNs and underlying spatio-temporal patterns in the graph, calls for innovative solutions. While interpretability concerns in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) mirror those of DNNs, to the best of our knowledge, no notable work has addressed the interpretability of temporal GNNs using a combination of Information Bottleneck (IB) principles and prototype-based methods. Our research introduces a novel approach that uniquely integrates these techniques to enhance the interpretability of temporal graph regression models.

We derive a novel theoretical bound on mutual information (MI), extending the applicability of IB principles to graph regression tasks. We incorporate an unsupervised auxiliary classification head, fostering multi-task learning and diverse concept representation, which enhances the model bottleneck's interpretability. Our model is evaluated on real-world traffic datasets, outperforming existing methods in both forecasting accuracy and interpretability-related metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

However, in urban environments, most events are naturally constrained within the city's street network structure, and the contagious effects of crime are governed by such a network geography. Meanwhile, the complex distribution of urban infrastructures also plays an important role in shaping crime patterns across space. We introduce a novel spatio-temporal-network point process framework for crime modeling that integrates these urban environmental characteristics by incorporating self-attention graph neural networks. Our framework incorporates the street network structure as the underlying event space, where crime events can occur at random locations on the network edges. To realistically capture criminal movement patterns, distances between events are measured using street network distances. We then propose a new mark for a crime event by concatenating the event's crime category with the type of its nearby landmark, aiming to capture how the urban design influences the mixing structures of various crime types. A graph attention network architecture is adopted to learn the existence of mark-to-mark interactions. Extensive experiments on crime data from Valencia, Spain, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in understanding the crime landscape and forecasting crime risks across regions.</p></details> |  |

Safety verification is now an imminent task prior to the large-scale deployment of such convoluted models. For safety-critical tasks in navigation, it becomes imperative to perform a verification procedure on the trajectories proposed by the planning algorithm prior to deployment. Signal Temporal Logic (STL) constraints can dictate the safety requirements for an AV. A combination of STL constraints is called a specification. A key difference between STL and other logic constraints is that STL allows us to work on continuous signals. We verify the satisfaction of the STL specifications by calculating the robustness value for each signal within the specification. Higher robustness values indicate a safer system. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is one of the most widely used methods to control the navigation of an AV, with an underlying set of state and input constraints. Our research aims to formulate and test an MPC controller, with STL specifications as constraints, that can safely navigate an AV. The primary goal of the cost function is to minimize the control inputs. STL constraints will act as an additional layer of constraints that would change based on the scenario and task on hand. We propose using sTaliro, a MATLAB-based robustness calculator for STL specifications, formulated in a receding horizon control fashion for an AV navigation task. It inputs a simplified AV state space model and a set of STL specifications, for which it constructs a closed-loop controller. We test out our controller for different test cases/scenarios and verify the safe navigation of our AV model.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, SAE WCX 2023 Conference</p></details> |

However, present methodology relies on algorithms that separate document and word representations. This prevents the creation of a meaningful embedding space where changes in word usage and documents can be directly analyzed in a temporal context. This paper proposes an expansion of the compass-aligned temporal Word2Vec methodology into dynamic topic modeling. Such a method allows for the direct comparison of word and document embeddings across time in dynamic topics. This enables the creation of visualizations that incorporate temporal word embeddings within the context of documents into topic visualizations. In experiments against the current state-of-the-art, our proposed method demonstrates overall competitive performance in topic relevancy and diversity across temporal datasets of varying size. Simultaneously, it provides insightful visualizations focused on temporal word embeddings while maintaining the insights provided by global topic evolution, advancing our understanding of how topics evolve over time.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures, conference paper</p></details> |

While limiting the variety of training data can make training easier, it can also lead to a lack of knowledge and information for the model, resulting in a decrease in performance. To address this challenge, we presented an innovative paradigm that incorporates three separate forms of curriculum learning specifically targeting from spatial, temporal, and quantile perspectives. Furthermore, our framework incorporates a stacking fusion module to combine diverse information from three types of curriculum learning, resulting in a strong and thorough learning process. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this framework with extensive empirical evaluations, highlighting its better performance in addressing complex ST challenges. We provided thorough ablation studies to investigate the effectiveness of our curriculum and to explain how it contributes to the improvement of learning efficiency on ST data.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accept by sigspatial 2024</p></details> |

The diffusion model, recognized for its superior quality and robust generalization, has been explored for this task. However, establishing a robust correspondence between temporal audio cues and corresponding spatial facial expressions with diffusion models remains a significant challenge in talking head generation. To bridge this gap, we present DreamHead, a hierarchical diffusion framework that learns spatial-temporal correspondences in talking head synthesis without compromising the model's intrinsic quality and adaptability.~DreamHead learns to predict dense facial landmarks from audios as intermediate signals to model the spatial and temporal correspondences.~Specifically, a first hierarchy of audio-to-landmark diffusion is first designed to predict temporally smooth and accurate landmark sequences given audio sequence signals. Then, a second hierarchy of landmark-to-image diffusion is further proposed to produce spatially consistent facial portrait videos, by modeling spatial correspondences between the dense facial landmark and appearance. Extensive experiments show that proposed DreamHead can effectively learn spatial-temporal consistency with the designed hierarchical diffusion and produce high-fidelity audio-driven talking head videos for multiple identities.</p></details> |  |

This work extends traditional prediction approaches by focusing on four-dimensional (4D) CSI, which includes predictions over time, bandwidth, and antenna (TX and RX) space. Such a comprehensive framework is essential for addressing the dynamic nature of mobility environments within intelligent transportation systems, necessitating the capture of both temporal and spatial dependencies across diverse domains. To address this complexity, we propose a novel context-conditioned spatiotemporal predictive learning method. This method leverages causal convolutional long short-term memory (CA-ConvLSTM) to effectively capture dependencies within 4D CSI data, and incorporates context-conditioned attention mechanisms to enhance the efficiency of spatiotemporal memory updates. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive meta-learning scheme tailored for recurrent networks to mitigate the issue of accumulative prediction errors. We validate the proposed method through empirical studies conducted across three different geometric configurations and mobility scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art predictive models, achieving superior performance across various geometries. Moreover, we show that the meta-learning framework significantly enhances the performance of recurrent-based predictive models in highly challenging cross-geometry settings, thus highlighting its robustness and adaptability.</p></details> |  |

By decomposing the dynamics into deterministic and error components, we construct a probabilistic reachable tube (PRT) as the Cartesian product of reachable sets of the individual error systems driven by disturbances lying in confidence regions (CRs) with a fixed probability. By bounding the PRT probability with the specification probability, we tighten all state constraints induced by the STL specification by solving tractable optimization problems over segments of the PRT, and relax the underlying stochastic problem with a deterministic one. This approach reduces conservatism compared to tightening guided by the STL structure. Additionally, we propose a recursively feasible algorithm to attack the resulting problem by decomposing it into agent-level subproblems, which are solved iteratively according to a scheduling policy. We demonstrate our method on a ten-agent system, where existing approaches are impractical.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation to CDC24</p></details> |

This paper proposes a novel risk metric to facilitate the driving task specified by linear temporal logic (LTL) by balancing the risk brought up by different uncertain events. Such a balance is achieved by discounting the costs of these uncertain events according to their timing and severity, thereby reflecting a human-like awareness of risk. We have established a connection between this risk metric and the occupation measure, a fundamental concept in stochastic reachability problems, such that a risk-aware control synthesis problem under LTL specifications is formulated for autonomous vehicles using occupation measures. As a result, the synthesized policy achieves balanced decisions across different types of risks with associated costs, showcasing advantageous versatility and generalizability. The effectiveness and scalability of the proposed approach are validated by three typical traffic scenarios in Carla simulator.</p></details> |  |

The analysis of micro-expressions generally involves two main tasks: spotting micro-expression intervals in long videos and recognizing the emotions associated with these intervals. Previous deep learning methods have primarily relied on classification networks utilizing sliding windows. However, fixed window sizes and window-level hard classification introduce numerous constraints. Additionally, these methods have not fully exploited the potential of complementary pathways for spotting and recognition. In this paper, we present a novel temporal state transition architecture grounded in the state space model, which replaces conventional window-level classification with video-level regression. Furthermore, by leveraging the inherent connections between spotting and recognition tasks, we propose a synergistic strategy that enhances overall analysis performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The codes and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/zizheng-guo/ME-TST.</p></details> |  |

Until recent years, numerous models had been proposed, ranging from classical algorithms like Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) to deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers. However, these models have shown limitations in areas such as generalizability, contextuality and scalability when it comes to effectively extracting the complex spatial-temporal information inherent in electroencephalography (EEG) signals. To address these limitations, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Mamba Network (STMambaNet), an innovative model leveraging the Mamba state space architecture, which excels in processing extended sequences with linear scalability. By incorporating spatial and temporal Mamba encoders, STMambaNet effectively captures the intricate dynamics in both space and time, significantly enhancing the decoding performance of EEG signals for MI classification. Experimental results on BCI Competition IV 2a and 2b datasets demonstrate STMambaNet's superiority over existing models, establishing it as a powerful tool for advancing MI-based BCIs and improving real-world BCI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages,3 figures, accepted conference:ADMA2024</p></details> |
| **[Triadic Temporal Exponential Random Graph Models (TTERGM)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16229v2)** | 2024-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal exponential random graph models (TERGM) are powerful statistical models that can be used to infer the temporal pattern of edge formation and elimination in complex networks (e.g., social networks). TERGMs can also be used in a generative capacity to predict longitudinal time series data in these evolving graphs. However, parameter estimation within this framework fails to capture many real-world properties of social networks, including: triadic relationships, small world characteristics, and social learning theories which could be used to constrain the probabilistic estimation of dyadic covariates. Here, we propose triadic temporal exponential random graph models (TTERGM) to fill this void, which includes these hierarchical network relationships within the graph model. We represent social network learning theory as an additional probability distribution that optimizes Markov chains in the graph vector space. The new parameters are then approximated via Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimation. We show that our TTERGM model achieves improved fidelity and more accurate predictions compared to several benchmark methods on GitHub network data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Sequencing of Documents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02578v2)** | 2024-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We outline an unsupervised method for temporal rank ordering of sets of historical documents, namely American State of the Union Addresses and DEEDS, a corpus of medieval English property transfer documents. Our method relies upon effectively capturing the gradual change in word usage via a bandwidth estimate for the non-parametric Generalized Linear Models (Fan, Heckman, and Wand, 1995). The number of possible rank orders needed to search through for cost functions related to the bandwidth can be quite large, even for a small set of documents. We tackle this problem of combinatorial optimization using the Simulated Annealing algorithm, which allows us to obtain the optimal document temporal orders. Our rank ordering method significantly improved the temporal sequencing of both corpora compared to a randomly sequenced baseline. This unsupervised approach should enable the temporal ordering of undated document sets.</p></details> |  |
| **[LACOSTE: Exploiting stereo and temporal contexts for surgical instrument segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09360v1)** | 2024-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surgical instrument segmentation is instrumental to minimally invasive surgeries and related applications. Most previous methods formulate this task as single-frame-based instance segmentation while ignoring the natural temporal and stereo attributes of a surgical video. As a result, these methods are less robust against the appearance variation through temporal motion and view change. In this work, we propose a novel LACOSTE model that exploits Location-Agnostic COntexts in Stereo and TEmporal images for improved surgical instrument segmentation. Leveraging a query-based segmentation model as core, we design three performance-enhancing modules. Firstly, we design a disparity-guided feature propagation module to enhance depth-aware features explicitly. To generalize well for even only a monocular video, we apply a pseudo stereo scheme to generate complementary right images. Secondly, we propose a stereo-temporal set classifier, which aggregates stereo-temporal contexts in a universal way for making a consolidated prediction and mitigates transient failures. Finally, we propose a location-agnostic classifier to decouple the location bias from mask prediction and enhance the feature semantics. We extensively validate our approach on three public surgical video datasets, including two benchmarks from EndoVis Challenges and one real radical prostatectomy surgery dataset GraSP. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performances of our method, which consistently achieves comparable or favorable results with previous state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to Medical Image Analysis</p></details> |

In practical environments with noise-corrupted audio, the role of video information becomes crucial. However, prior works have primarily focused on enhancing audio features in AVSR, overlooking the importance of video features. In this study, we strengthen the video features by learning three temporal dynamics in video data: context order, playback direction, and the speed of video frames. Cross-modal attention modules are introduced to enrich video features with audio information so that speech variability can be taken into account when training on the video temporal dynamics. Based on our approach, we achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the LRS2 and LRS3 AVSR benchmarks for the noise-dominant settings. Our approach excels in scenarios especially for babble and speech noise, indicating the ability to distinguish the speech signal that should be recognized from lip movements in the video modality. We support the validity of our methodology by offering the ablation experiments for the temporal dynamics losses and the cross-modal attention architecture design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SLT 2024 Main Conference</p></details> |

We present Capability-Augmenting Tasks (CATs), which encode how agents can augment their capabilities based on interactions with other teammates. Our framework integrates CAT into the semantics of Metric Temporal Logic (MTL), which defines individual spatio-temporal tasks for all agents. A centralized Mixed-Integer Program (MIP) is used to synthesize trajectories for all agents. We compare the expressivity of our approach to a baseline of Capability Temporal Logic Plus (CaTL+). Case studies demonstrate that our approach allows for simpler specifications and improves individual performance when agents leverage the capabilities of their teammates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accurate and Fast Estimation of Temporal Motifs using Path Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08975v1)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Counting the number of small subgraphs, called motifs, is a fundamental problem in social network analysis and graph mining. Many real-world networks are directed and temporal, where edges have timestamps. Motif counting in directed, temporal graphs is especially challenging because there are a plethora of different kinds of patterns. Temporal motif counts reveal much richer information and there is a need for scalable algorithms for motif counting. A major challenge in counting is that there can be trillions of temporal motif matches even with a graph with only millions of vertices. Both the motifs and the input graphs can have multiple edges between two vertices, leading to a combinatorial explosion problem. Counting temporal motifs involving just four vertices is not feasible with current state-of-the-art algorithms. We design an algorithm, TEACUPS, that addresses this problem using a novel technique of temporal path sampling. We combine a path sampling method with carefully designed temporal data structures, to propose an efficient approximate algorithm for temporal motif counting. TEACUPS is an unbiased estimator with provable concentration behavior, which can be used to bound the estimation error. For a Bitcoin graph with hundreds of millions of edges, TEACUPS runs in less than 1 minute, while the exact counting algorithm takes more than a day. We empirically demonstrate the accuracy of TEACUPS on large datasets, showing an average of 30$\times$ speedup (up to 2000$\times$ speedup) compared to existing GPU-based exact counting methods while preserving high count estimation accuracy.</p></details> | Accepted for ICDM'24 |

Existing methods often treat road networks over time as spatial-temporal graphs, addressing spatial and temporal representations independently. However, these approaches struggle to capture the dynamic topology of road networks, encounter issues with message passing mechanisms and over-smoothing, and face challenges in learning spatial and temporal relationships separately. To address these limitations, we propose treating nodes in road networks at different time steps as independent spatial-temporal tokens and feeding them into a vanilla Transformer to learn complex spatial-temporal patterns, design \textbf{STformer} achieving SOTA. Given its quadratic complexity, we introduce a variant \textbf{NSTformer} based on Nystr$\ddot{o}$m method to approximate self-attention with linear complexity but even slightly better than former in a few cases astonishingly. Extensive experimental results on traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance at an affordable computational cost.

Our proposed Random Walkers Induced temporal Graph (RWIG) model generates temporal graph sequences based on independent random walkers that traverse an underlying graph in discrete time steps. Co-location of walkers at a given node and time defines an individual-level contact. RWIG is shown to be a realistic model for temporal human contact graphs, which may place RWIG on a same footing as the Erdos-Renyi (ER) and Barabasi-Albert (BA) models for fixed graphs. Moreover, RWIG is analytically feasible: we derive closed form solutions for the probability distribution of contact graphs.</p></details> |  |

Text-to-video generation has made remarkable progress over the past year, but the absence of harmonious audio in generated video limits its broader applications. In this paper, we propose Semantic and Temporal Aligned Video-to-Audio (STA-V2A), an approach that enhances audio generation from videos by extracting both local temporal and global semantic video features and combining these refined video features with text as cross-modal guidance. To address the issue of information redundancy in videos, we propose an onset prediction pretext task for local temporal feature extraction and an attentive pooling module for global semantic feature extraction. To supplement the insufficient semantic information in videos, we propose a Latent Diffusion Model with Text-to-Audio priors initialization and cross-modal guidance. We also introduce Audio-Audio Align, a new metric to assess audio-temporal alignment. Subjective and objective metrics demonstrate that our method surpasses existing Video-to-Audio models in generating audio with better quality, semantic consistency, and temporal alignment.

Recently, Audio Question Answering has garnered attention due to the advent of Large Audio Language Models. Current literature focuses on constructing LALMs by integrating audio encoders with text only Large Language Models through a projection module. While Large Audio Language Models excel in general audio understanding, they are limited in temporal reasoning which may hinder their commercial applications and on device deployment. This paper addresses these challenges and limitations in audio temporal reasoning. First, we introduce a data augmentation technique for generating reliable audio temporal questions and answers using an LLM. Second, we propose a continued finetuning curriculum learning strategy to specialize in temporal reasoning without compromising performance on finetuned tasks. Finally, we develop a reliable and transparent automated metric, assisted by an LLM, to measure the correlation between Large Audio Language Model responses and ground truth data intelligently. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed techniques using SOTA LALMs on public audio benchmark datasets.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

Current state-of-the-art methods either require multiple independent stages of processing that employ motion cues or, in the case of end-to-end trainable networks, lack in segmentation accuracy, in part due to the difficulty of learning segmentation maps from videos with transient object presence. This limits the application of WSVOS for semantic annotation of surgical videos where multiple surgical tools frequently move in and out of the field of view, a problem that is more difficult than typically encountered in WSVOS. This paper introduces Video Spatio-Temporal Disentanglement Networks (VDST-Net), a framework to disentangle spatiotemporal information using semi-decoupled knowledge distillation to predict high-quality class activation maps (CAMs). A teacher network designed to resolve temporal conflicts when specifics about object location and timing in the video are not provided works with a student network that integrates information over time by leveraging temporal dependencies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on a public reference dataset and on a more challenging surgical video dataset where objects are, on average, present in less than 60\% of annotated frames. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and generates superior segmentation masks under video-level weak supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

However, current methods often neglect high-order latent collaborative relationships and fail to dynamically adjust feature learning for specific user-service invocations, which are critical for precise feature extraction within each time slice. Moreover, the prevalent use of RNNs for modeling temporal feature evolution patterns is constrained by their inherent difficulty in managing long-range dependencies, thereby limiting the detection of long-term QoS trends across multiple time slices. These shortcomings dramatically degrade the performance of temporal QoS prediction. To address the two issues, we propose a novel Graph Attention Collaborative Learning (GACL) framework for temporal QoS prediction. Building on a dynamic user-service invocation graph to comprehensively model historical interactions, it designs a target-prompt graph attention network to extract deep latent features of users and services at each time slice, considering implicit target-neighboring collaborative relationships and historical QoS values. Additionally, a multi-layer Transformer encoder is introduced to uncover temporal feature evolution patterns, enhancing temporal QoS prediction. Extensive experiments on the WS-DREAM dataset demonstrate that GACL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for temporal QoS prediction across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving the improvements of up to 38.80%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

Existing studies rely on scale transformations conceptualized over either a definite geometric structure of the system (very often realized as length-scale transformations) or purely temporal scale transformations. However, many physical and social systems are observed as temporal interactions among agents without any definitive geometry. Yet, one can imagine the existence of an underlying notion of distance as the interactions are mostly localized. Analysing only the time-scale transformations over such systems would uncover only a limited aspect of the complexity. In this work, we propose a novel technique of scale transformation that dissects temporal interaction networks under spatio-temporal scales, namely, flow scales. Upon experimenting with multiple social and biological interaction networks, we find that many of them possess a finite fractal dimension under flow-scale transformation. Finally, we relate the emergence of flow-scale self-similarity to the latent geometry of such networks. We observe strong evidence that justifies the assumption of an underlying, variable-curvature hyperbolic geometry that induces self-similarity of temporal interaction networks. Our work bears implications for modeling temporal interaction networks at different scales and uncovering their latent geometric structures.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies on collaborative perception mostly utilize CNNs or Transformers to learn feature representation and fusion in the spatial dimension, which struggle to handle long-range spatial-temporal features under limited computing and communication resources. Holistically modeling the dependencies over extensive spatial areas and extended temporal frames is crucial to enhancing feature quality. To this end, we propose a resource efficient cross-agent spatial-temporal collaborative state space model (SSM), named CollaMamba. Initially, we construct a foundational backbone network based on spatial SSM. This backbone adeptly captures positional causal dependencies from both single-agent and cross-agent views, yielding compact and comprehensive intermediate features while maintaining linear complexity. Furthermore, we devise a history-aware feature boosting module based on temporal SSM, extracting contextual cues from extended historical frames to refine vague features while preserving low overhead. Extensive experiments across several datasets demonstrate that CollaMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher model accuracy while reducing computational and communication overhead by up to 71.9% and 1/64, respectively. This work pioneers the exploration of the Mamba's potential in collaborative perception.

While these sensors provide near real-time data for science, the data are prone to technical anomalies that can undermine the trustworthiness of the data and the accuracy of statistical inferences, particularly in spatial and temporal analyses. Here we propose a framework for detecting anomalies in sensor data recorded in stream networks, which takes advantage of spatial and temporal autocorrelation to improve detection rates. The proposed framework involves the implementation of effective data imputation to handle missing data, alignment of time-series to address temporal disparities, and the identification of water quality events. We explore the effectiveness of a suite of state-of-the-art statistical methods including posterior predictive distributions, finite mixtures, and Hidden Markov Models (HMM). We showcase the practical implementation of automated anomaly detection in near-real time by employing a Bayesian recursive approach. This demonstration is conducted through a comprehensive simulation study and a practical application to a substantive case study situated in the Herbert River, located in Queensland, Australia, which flows into the Great Barrier Reef. We found that methods such as posterior predictive distributions and HMM produce the best performance in detecting multiple types of anomalies. Utilizing data from multiple sensors deployed relatively near one another enhances the ability to distinguish between water quality events and technical anomalies, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of anomaly detection. Thus, uncertainty and biases in water quality reporting, interpretation, and modelling are reduced, and the effectiveness of subsequent management actions improved.</p></details> |  |

These channels result from contention for shared microarchitectural state. In the RISC-V instruction set, the temporal fence instruction (fence.t) was proposed to close timing channels by providing an operating system with the means to temporally partition microarchitectural state inexpensively in simple in-order cores. This work explores challenges with fence.t in superscalar out-of-order cores featuring large and pervasive microarchitectural state. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel SW-supported temporal fence (fence.t.s), which reuses existing mechanisms and supports advanced microarchitectural features, enabling full timing channel protection of an exemplary out-of-order core (OpenC910) at negligible hardware costs and a minimal performance impact of 1.0 %.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 1 algorithm, 1 listing.

| **[Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Temporal Abstraction of Listwise Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07416v1)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern listwise recommendation systems need to consider both long-term user perceptions and short-term interest shifts. Reinforcement learning can be applied on recommendation to study such a problem but is also subject to large search space, sparse user feedback and long interactive latency. Motivated by recent progress in hierarchical reinforcement learning, we propose a novel framework called mccHRL to provide different levels of temporal abstraction on listwise recommendation. Within the hierarchical framework, the high-level agent studies the evolution of user perception, while the low-level agent produces the item selection policy by modeling the process as a sequential decision-making problem. We argue that such framework has a well-defined decomposition of the outra-session context and the intra-session context, which are encoded by the high-level and low-level agents, respectively. To verify this argument, we implement both a simulator-based environment and an industrial dataset-based experiment. Results observe significant performance improvement by our method, compared with several well-known baselines. Data and codes have been made public.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Temporal Valued Constraint Satisfaction Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07285v1)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the complexity of the valued constraint satisfaction problem (VCSP) for every valued structure with the domain ${\mathbb Q}$ that is preserved by all order-preserving bijections. Such VCSPs will be called temporal, in analogy to the (classical) constraint satisfaction problem: a relational structure is preserved by all order-preserving bijections if and only if all its relations have a first-order definition in $({\mathbb Q};<)$, and the CSPs for such structures are called temporal CSPs. Many optimization problems that have been studied intensively in the literature can be phrased as a temporal VCSP. We prove that a temporal VCSP is in P, or NP-complete. Our analysis uses the concept of fractional polymorphisms; this is the first dichotomy result for VCSPs over infinite domains which is complete in the sense that it treats all valued structures with a given automorphism group.</p></details> |  |

However, video making it challenging for LVLMs to perform adequately due to the complexity of the relationship between language and spatial-temporal data structure. Recent Large Video-Language Models (LVidLMs) align feature of static visual data like image into latent space of language feature, by general multi-modal tasks to leverage abilities of LLMs sufficiently. In this paper, we explore fine-grained alignment approach via object trajectory for different modalities across both spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously. Thus, we propose a novel LVidLM by trajectory-guided Pixel-Temporal Alignment, dubbed PiTe, that exhibits promising applicable model property. To achieve fine-grained video-language alignment, we curate a multi-modal pre-training dataset PiTe-143k, the dataset provision of moving trajectories in pixel level for all individual objects, that appear and mention in the video and caption both, by our automatic annotation pipeline. Meanwhile, PiTe demonstrates astounding capabilities on myriad video-related multi-modal tasks through beat the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.</p></details> |  |

However, while a substantial amount of diffusion-based research has focused on generative tasks, no work introduces diffusion models to advance the results of polyp segmentation in videos, which is frequently challenged by polyps' high camouflage and redundant temporal cues.In this paper, we present a novel diffusion-based network for video polyp segmentation task, dubbed as Diff-VPS. We incorporate multi-task supervision into diffusion models to promote the discrimination of diffusion models on pixel-by-pixel segmentation. This integrates the contextual high-level information achieved by the joint classification and detection tasks. To explore the temporal dependency, Temporal Reasoning Module (TRM) is devised via reasoning and reconstructing the target frame from the previous frames. We further equip TRM with a generative adversarial self-supervised strategy to produce more realistic frames and thus capture better dynamic cues. Extensive experiments are conducted on SUN-SEG, and the results indicate that our proposed Diff-VPS significantly achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Specifically, we consider the global task as a conjunction of independent and collaborative tasks, defined over the absolute and relative states of agent pairs. Task dependencies in this form are then represented by a task graph, which we assume to be acyclic. From the given task graph, we provide an algorithmic approach to define a distributed sampled-data controller prioritizing the fulfilment of collaborative tasks as the primary objective, while fulfilling independent tasks unless they conflict with collaborative ones. Moreover, communication maintenance among collaborating agents is seamlessly enforced within the proposed control framework. A numerical simulation is provided to showcase the potential of our control framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Short...</summary><p>Short version of this paper was accepted for the Conference on Decision and Control.

| **[Towards Predicting Temporal Changes in a Patient's Chest X-ray Images based on Electronic Health Records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07012v1)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chest X-ray imaging (CXR) is an important diagnostic tool used in hospitals to assess patient conditions and monitor changes over time. Generative models, specifically diffusion-based models, have shown promise in generating realistic synthetic X-rays. However, these models mainly focus on conditional generation using single-time-point data, i.e., typically CXRs taken at a specific time with their corresponding reports, limiting their clinical utility, particularly for capturing temporal changes. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, EHRXDiff, which predicts future CXR images by integrating previous CXRs with subsequent medical events, e.g., prescriptions, lab measures, etc. Our framework dynamically tracks and predicts disease progression based on a latent diffusion model, conditioned on the previous CXR image and a history of medical events. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of our framework across three key aspects, including clinical consistency, demographic consistency, and visual realism. We demonstrate that our framework generates high-quality, realistic future images that capture potential temporal changes, suggesting its potential for further development as a clinical simulation tool. This could offer valuable insights for patient monitoring and treatment planning in the medical field.</p></details> |  |

However, existing works often neglect the frame-level redundancy inherent in continuous time series, resulting in incomplete modality representations with noise. To address this issue, we propose temporal-invariant learning for the first time, which constrains the distributional variations over time steps to effectively capture long-term temporal dynamics, thus enhancing the quality of the representations and the robustness of the model. To fully exploit the rich semantic information in textual knowledge, we propose a semantic-guided fusion module. By evaluating the correlations between different modalities, this module facilitates cross-modal interactions gated by modality-invariant representations. Furthermore, we introduce a modality discriminator to disentangle modality-invariant and modality-specific subspaces. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model.

In first-order modal logic, definite descriptions have been widely investigated for their non-rigidity, which allows them to designate different objects (or none at all) at different states. We propose expressive modal description logics with non-rigid definite descriptions and names, and investigate decidability and complexity of the satisfaction problem. We first systematically link satisfiability for the one-variable fragment of first-order modal logic with counting to our modal description logics. Then, we prove a promising NEXPTIME-completeness result for concept satisfiability for the fundamental epistemic multi-agent logic $\mathbf{S5}^{n}$ and its neighbours, and show that some expressive logics that are undecidable with constant domain become decidable (but Ackermann-hard) with expanding domains. Finally, we conduct a fine-grained analysis of decidability of temporal logics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Developing the Temporal Graph Convolutional Neural Network Model to Predict Hip Replacement using Electronic Health Records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06585v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Hip replacement procedures improve patient lives by relieving pain and restoring mobility. Predicting hip replacement in advance could reduce pain by enabling timely interventions, prioritising individuals for surgery or rehabilitation, and utilising physiotherapy to potentially delay the need for joint replacement. This study predicts hip replacement a year in advance to enhance quality of life and health service efficiency. Methods: Adapting previous work using Temporal Graph Convolutional Neural Network (TG-CNN) models, we construct temporal graphs from primary care medical event codes, sourced from ResearchOne EHRs of 40-75-year-old patients, to predict hip replacement risk. We match hip replacement cases to controls by age, sex, and Index of Multiple Deprivation. The model, trained on 9,187 cases and 9,187 controls, predicts hip replacement one year in advance. We validate the model on two unseen datasets, recalibrating for class imbalance. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study and compare against four baseline models. Results: Our best model predicts hip replacement risk one year in advance with an AUROC of 0.724 (95% CI: 0.715-0.733) and an AUPRC of 0.185 (95% CI: 0.160-0.209), achieving a calibration slope of 1.107 (95% CI: 1.074-1.139) after recalibration. Conclusions: The TG-CNN model effectively predicts hip replacement risk by identifying patterns in patient trajectories, potentially improving understanding and management of hip-related conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2024 International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA). 8 pages, 3 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

However, scalability and generalization challenges remain significant obstacles. Advanced models often rely on Graph Neural Networks to encode spatial and temporal correlations, but struggle with the increased complexity of large-scale datasets. The recursive GNN-based message passing schemes used in these models hinder their training and deployment in real-life urban sensing scenarios. Moreover, long-spanning large-scale spatio-temporal data introduce distribution shifts, necessitating improved generalization performance. To address these challenges, we propose a simple framework for spatio-temporal prediction - EasyST paradigm. It learns lightweight and robust Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) by effectively distilling knowledge from complex spatio-temporal GNNs. We ensure robust knowledge distillation by integrating the spatio-temporal information bottleneck with teacher-bounded regression loss, filtering out task-irrelevant noise and avoiding erroneous guidance. We further enhance the generalization ability of the student model by incorporating spatial and temporal prompts to provide downstream task contexts. Evaluation on three spatio-temporal datasets for urban computing tasks demonstrates that EasyST surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in terms of efficiency and accuracy. The implementation code is available at: https://github.com/HKUDS/EasyST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM'2024, full paper</p></details> |

| **[Retrofitting Temporal Graph Neural Networks with Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05477v2)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) outperform regular GNNs by incorporating time information into graph-based operations. However, TGNNs adopt specialized models (e.g., TGN, TGAT, and APAN ) and require tailored training frameworks (e.g., TGL and ETC). In this paper, we propose TF-TGN, which uses Transformer decoder as the backbone model for TGNN to enjoy Transformer's codebase for efficient training. In particular, Transformer achieves tremendous success for language modeling, and thus the community developed high-performance kernels (e.g., flash-attention and memory-efficient attention) and efficient distributed training schemes (e.g., PyTorch FSDP, DeepSpeed, and Megatron-LM). We observe that TGNN resembles language modeling, i.e., the message aggregation operation between chronologically occurring nodes and their temporal neighbors in TGNNs can be structured as sequence modeling. Beside this similarity, we also incorporate a series of algorithm designs including suffix infilling, temporal graph attention with self-loop, and causal masking self-attention to make TF-TGN work. During training, existing systems are slow in transforming the graph topology and conducting graph sampling. As such, we propose methods to parallelize the CSR format conversion and graph sampling. We also adapt Transformer codebase to train TF-TGN efficiently with multiple GPUs. We experiment with 9 graphs and compare with 2 state-of-the-art TGNN training frameworks. The results show that TF-TGN can accelerate training by over 2.20 while providing comparable or even superior accuracy to existing SOTA TGNNs.

Most existing methods are tailored for individual forecasting or imputation tasks but are not designed for both. Additionally, they are less effective for zero-shot and few-shot learning. While pre-trained language model (PLM) have exhibited strong pattern recognition and reasoning abilities across various tasks, including few-shot and zero-shot learning, their applications in spatial-temporal data understanding has been constrained by insufficient modeling of complex correlations such as the temporal correlations, spatial connectivity, non-pairwise and high-order spatial-temporal correlations within data. In this paper, we propose STD-PLM for understanding both spatial and temporal properties of \underline{S}patial-\underline{T}emporal \underline{D}ata with \underline{PLM}, which is capable of implementing both spatial-temporal forecasting and imputation tasks. STD-PLM understands spatial-temporal correlations via explicitly designed spatial and temporal tokenizers. Topology-aware node embeddings are designed for PLM to comprehend and exploit the topology structure of data in inductive manner. Furthermore, to mitigate the efficiency issues introduced by the PLM, we design a sandglass attention module (SGA) combined with a specific constrained loss function, which significantly improves the model's efficiency while ensuring performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STD-PLM exhibits competitive performance and generalization capabilities across the forecasting and imputation tasks on various datasets. Moreover, STD-PLM achieves promising results on both few-shot and zero-shot tasks.The code is made available at \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/STD-PLM-F3BA}{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/STD-PLM-F3BA}</p></details> |  |

While Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have been effective in scene reconstruction, their slow inference speeds and lengthy training durations limit their applicability. To overcome these limitations, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) based methods have emerged as a recent trend, offering rapid inference capabilities and superior 3D quality. However, these methods still struggle with under-reconstruction in both static and dynamic scenes. In this paper, we propose HFGS, a novel approach for deformable endoscopic reconstruction that addresses these challenges from spatial and temporal frequency perspectives. Our approach incorporates deformation fields to better handle dynamic scenes and introduces Spatial High-Frequency Emphasis Reconstruction (SHF) to minimize discrepancies in spatial frequency spectra between the rendered image and its ground truth. Additionally, we introduce Temporal High-Frequency Emphasis Reconstruction (THF) to enhance dynamic awareness in neural rendering by leveraging flow priors, focusing optimization on motion-intensive parts. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate that HFGS achieves superior rendering quality.</p></details> | BMVC2024 |
| **[On the Recoverability of Causal Relations from Temporally Aggregated I.I.D. Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02191v3)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the effect of temporal aggregation on instantaneous (non-temporal) causal discovery in general setting. This is motivated by the observation that the true causal time lag is often considerably shorter than the observational interval. This discrepancy leads to high aggregation, causing time-delay causality to vanish and instantaneous dependence to manifest. Although we expect such instantaneous dependence has consistency with the true causal relation in certain sense to make the discovery results meaningful, it remains unclear what type of consistency we need and when will such consistency be satisfied. We proposed functional consistency and conditional independence consistency in formal way correspond functional causal model-based methods and conditional independence-based methods respectively and provide the conditions under which these consistencies will hold. We show theoretically and experimentally that causal discovery results may be seriously distorted by aggregation especially in complete nonlinear case and we also find causal relationship still recoverable from aggregated data if we have partial linearity or appropriate prior. Our findings suggest community should take a cautious and meticulous approach when interpreting causal discovery results from such data and show why and when aggregation will distort the performance of causal discovery methods.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |
| **[Prediction-Feedback DETR for Temporal Action Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16729v2)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Action Detection (TAD) is fundamental yet challenging for real-world video applications. Leveraging the unique benefits of transformers, various DETR-based approaches have been adopted in TAD. However, it has recently been identified that the attention collapse in self-attention causes the performance degradation of DETR for TAD. Building upon previous research, this paper newly addresses the attention collapse problem in cross-attention within DETR-based TAD methods. Moreover, our findings reveal that cross-attention exhibits patterns distinct from predictions, indicating a short-cut phenomenon. To resolve this, we propose a new framework, Prediction-Feedback DETR (Pred-DETR), which utilizes predictions to restore the collapse and align the cross- and self-attention with predictions. Specifically, we devise novel prediction-feedback objectives using guidance from the relations of the predictions. As a result, Pred-DETR significantly alleviates the collapse and achieves state-of-the-art performance among DETR-based methods on various challenging benchmarks including THUMOS14, ActivityNet-v1.3, HACS, and FineAction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Long-term Pre-training for Temporal Action Detection with Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13152v2)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal action detection (TAD) is challenging, yet fundamental for real-world video applications. Recently, DETR-based models for TAD have been prevailing thanks to their unique benefits. However, transformers demand a huge dataset, and unfortunately data scarcity in TAD causes a severe degeneration. In this paper, we identify two crucial problems from data scarcity: attention collapse and imbalanced performance. To this end, we propose a new pre-training strategy, Long-Term Pre-training (LTP), tailored for transformers. LTP has two main components: 1) class-wise synthesis, 2) long-term pretext tasks. Firstly, we synthesize long-form video features by merging video snippets of a target class and non-target classes. They are analogous to untrimmed data used in TAD, despite being created from trimmed data. In addition, we devise two types of long-term pretext tasks to learn long-term dependency. They impose long-term conditions such as finding second-to-fourth or short-duration actions. Our extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performances in DETR-based methods on ActivityNet-v1.3 and THUMOS14 by a large margin. Moreover, we demonstrate that LTP significantly relieves the data scarcity issues in TAD.</p></details> |  |

The covariates and errors of the regression model are tackled as a general class of nonstationary time series and are allowed to be cross-dependent. A novel and easy-to-implement self-convolved bootstrap procedure is proposed. With only one tuning parameter, the bootstrap facilitates a $\sqrt{n}$-consistent inference of the cumulative regression function for the M-estimators under complex temporal dynamics, even under the possible presence of breakpoints in time series. Our methodology leads to a unified framework to conduct general classes of Exact Function Tests, Lack-of-fit Tests, and Qualitative Tests for the time-varying coefficients. These tests enable one to, among many others, conduct variable selection, check for constancy and linearity, as well as verify shape assumptions, including monotonicity and convexity. As applications, our method is utilized to study the time-varying properties of global climate data and Microsoft stock return, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[A general reduced-order neural operator for spatio-temporal predictive learning on complex spatial domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05508v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive learning for spatio-temporal processes (PL-STP) on complex spatial domains plays a critical role in various scientific and engineering fields, with its essence being the construction of operators between infinite-dimensional function spaces. This paper focuses on the unequal-domain mappings in PL-STP and categorising them into increase-domain and decrease-domain mapping. Recent advances in deep learning have revealed the great potential of neural operators (NOs) to learn operators directly from observational data. However, existing NOs require input space and output space to be the same domain, which pose challenges in ensuring predictive accuracy and stability for unequal-domain mappings. To this end, this study presents a general reduced-order neural operator named Reduced-Order Neural Operator on Riemannian Manifolds (RO-NORM), which consists of two parts: the unequal-domain encoder/decoder and the same-domain approximator. Motivated by the variable separation in classical modal decomposition, the unequal-domain encoder/decoder uses the pre-computed bases to reformulate the spatio-temporal function as a sum of products between spatial (or temporal) bases and corresponding temporally (or spatially) distributed weight functions, thus the original unequal-domain mapping can be converted into a same-domain mapping. Consequently, the same-domain approximator NORM is applied to model the transformed mapping. The performance of our proposed method has been evaluated on six benchmark cases, including parametric PDEs, engineering and biomedical applications, and compared with four baseline algorithms: DeepONet, POD-DeepONet, PCA-Net, and vanilla NORM. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of RO-NORM in prediction accuracy and training efficiency for PL-STP.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Attention-Based Method for Detecting Student Classroom Behaviors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02523v4)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately detecting student behavior from classroom videos is beneficial for analyzing their classroom status and improving teaching efficiency. However, low accuracy in student classroom behavior detection is a prevalent issue. To address this issue, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Attention-Based Method for Detecting Student Classroom Behaviors (BDSTA). Firstly, the SlowFast network is used to generate motion and environmental information feature maps from the video. Then, the spatio-temporal attention module is applied to the feature maps, including information aggregation, compression and stimulation processes. Subsequently, attention maps in the time, channel and space dimensions are obtained, and multi-label behavior classification is performed based on these attention maps. To solve the long-tail data problem that exists in student classroom behavior datasets, we use an improved focal loss function to assign more weight to the tail class data during training. Experimental results are conducted on a self-made student classroom behavior dataset named STSCB. Compared with the SlowFast model, the average accuracy of student behavior classification detection improves by 8.94\% using BDSTA.</p></details> |  |

However, the lack of publicly available spatio-temporal datasets on student behavior, as well as the high cost of manually labeling such datasets, pose significant challenges for researchers in this field. To address this issue, we proposed a method for extending the spatio-temporal behavior dataset in Student Classroom Scenarios (SCB-ST-Dataset4) through image dataset. Our SCB-ST-Dataset4 comprises 757265 images with 25810 labels, focusing on 3 behaviors: hand-raising, reading, writing. Our proposed method can rapidly generate spatio-temporal behavior datasets without requiring extra manual labeling. Furthermore, we proposed a Behavior Similarity Index (BSI) to explore the similarity of behaviors. We evaluated the dataset using the YOLOv5, YOLOv7, YOLOv8, and SlowFast algorithms, achieving a mean average precision (map) of up to 82.3%. Last, we fused multiple models to generate student behavior-related data from various perspectives. The experiment further demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. And SCB-ST-Dataset4 provides a robust foundation for future research in student behavior detection, potentially contributing to advancements in this field.

Developing techniques to identify and analyze communities in these time-varying graph structures is an important challenge. In this work, we generalize existing spectral clustering algorithms from static to dynamic graphs using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to capture the temporal evolution of clusters. Based on this extended canonical correlation framework, we define the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian and investigate its spectral properties. We connect these concepts to dynamical systems theory via transfer operators, and illustrate the advantages of our method on benchmark graphs by comparison with existing methods. We show that the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian allows for a clear interpretation of cluster structure evolution over time for directed and undirected graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine Anomalous Sound Detection Using Spectral-temporal Modulation Representations Derived from Machine-specific Filterbanks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05319v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early detection of factory machinery malfunctions is crucial in industrial applications. In machine anomalous sound detection (ASD), different machines exhibit unique vibration-frequency ranges based on their physical properties. Meanwhile, the human auditory system is adept at tracking both temporal and spectral dynamics of machine sounds. Consequently, integrating the computational auditory models of the human auditory system with machine-specific properties can be an effective approach to machine ASD. We first quantified the frequency importances of four types of machines using the Fisher ratio (F-ratio). The quantified frequency importances were then used to design machine-specific non-uniform filterbanks (NUFBs), which extract the log non-uniform spectrum (LNS) feature. The designed NUFBs have a narrower bandwidth and higher filter distribution density in frequency regions with relatively high F-ratios. Finally, spectral and temporal modulation representations derived from the LNS feature were proposed. These proposed LNS feature and modulation representations are input into an autoencoder neural-network-based detector for ASD. The quantification results from the training set of the Malfunctioning Industrial Machine Investigation and Inspection dataset with a signal-to-noise (SNR) of 6 dB reveal that the distinguishing information between normal and anomalous sounds of different machines is encoded non-uniformly in the frequency domain. By highlighting these important frequency regions using NUFBs, the LNS feature can significantly enhance performance using the metric of AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) under various SNR conditions. Furthermore, modulation representations can further improve performance. Specifically, temporal modulation is effective for fans, pumps, and sliders, while spectral modulation is particularly effective for valves.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ultron: Enabling Temporal Geometry Compression of 3D Mesh Sequences using Temporal Correspondence and Mesh Deformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05151v1)** | 2024-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advancement of computer vision, dynamic 3D reconstruction techniques have seen significant progress and found applications in various fields. However, these techniques generate large amounts of 3D data sequences, necessitating efficient storage and transmission methods. Existing 3D model compression methods primarily focus on static models and do not consider inter-frame information, limiting their ability to reduce data size. Temporal mesh compression, which has received less attention, often requires all input meshes to have the same topology, a condition rarely met in real-world applications. This research proposes a method to compress mesh sequences with arbitrary topology using temporal correspondence and mesh deformation. The method establishes temporal correspondence between consecutive frames, applies a deformation model to transform the mesh from one frame to subsequent frames, and replaces the original meshes with deformed ones if the quality meets a tolerance threshold. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this method can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of compression performance. The contributions of this paper include a geometry and motion-based model for establishing temporal correspondence between meshes, a mesh quality assessment for temporal mesh sequences, an entropy-based encoding and corner table-based method for compressing mesh sequences, and extensive experiments showing the effectiveness of the proposed method. All the code will be open-sourced at https://github.com/lszhuhaichao/ultron.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, we propose the Spatial-Temporal Large Language Model Diffusion (STLLM-DF), an innovative model that leverages Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve multi-task transportation prediction. The DDPM's robust denoising capabilities enable it to recover underlying data patterns from noisy inputs, making it particularly effective in complex transportation systems. Meanwhile, the non-pretrained LLM dynamically adapts to spatial-temporal relationships within multi-modal networks, allowing the system to efficiently manage diverse transportation tasks in both long-term and short-term predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STLLM-DF consistently outperforms existing models, achieving an average reduction of 2.40\% in MAE, 4.50\% in RMSE, and 1.51\% in MAPE. This model significantly advances centralized ITS by enhancing predictive accuracy, robustness, and overall system performance across multiple tasks, thus paving the way for more effective spatio-temporal traffic forecasting through the integration of frozen transformer language models and diffusion techniques.</p></details> | 26 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Efficient Rare Temporal Pattern Mining in Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05042v1)** | 2024-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data from various domains are increasing continuously. Extracting and analyzing the temporal patterns in these series can reveal significant insights. Temporal pattern mining (TPM) extends traditional pattern mining by incorporating event time intervals into extracted patterns, enhancing their expressiveness but increasing time and space complexities. One valuable type of temporal pattern is known as rare temporal patterns (RTPs), which occur rarely but with high confidence. There exist several challenges when mining rare temporal patterns. The support measure is set very low, leading to a further combinatorial explosion and potentially producing too many uninteresting patterns. Thus, an efficient approach to rare temporal pattern mining is needed. This paper introduces our Rare Temporal Pattern Mining from Time Series (RTPMfTS) method for discovering rare temporal patterns, featuring the following key contributions: (1) An end-to-end RTPMfTS process that takes time series data as input and yields rare temporal patterns as output. (2) An efficient Rare Temporal Pattern Mining (RTPM) algorithm that uses optimized data structures for quick event and pattern retrieval and utilizes effective pruning techniques for much faster mining. (3) A thorough experimental evaluation of RTPM, showing that RTPM outperforms the baseline in terms of runtime and memory usage.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2306.10994</p></details> |

A critical component of disease behavior is the velocity with which disease spreads, defined as the rate of change between time and space. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal modeling approach to determine the velocities of infectious disease spread. Our approach assumes that the locations and times of people infected can be considered as a spatio-temporal point pattern that arises as a realization of a spatio-temporal log-Gaussian Cox process. The intensity of this process is estimated using fast Bayesian inference by employing the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) and the Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE) approaches. The velocity is then calculated using finite differences that approximate the derivatives of the intensity function. Finally, the directions and magnitudes of the velocities can be mapped at specific times to examine better the spread of the disease throughout the region. We demonstrate our method by analyzing COVID-19 spread in Cali, Colombia, during the 2020-2021 pandemic.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 46 figures, Journal American Statistican, submitted on 3rd of September</p></details> |
| **[TOGS: Gaussian Splatting with Temporal Opacity Offset for Real-Time 4D DSA Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19586v2)** | 2024-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Four-dimensional Digital Subtraction Angiography (4D DSA) is a medical imaging technique that provides a series of 2D images captured at different stages and angles during the process of contrast agent filling blood vessels. It plays a significant role in the diagnosis of cerebrovascular diseases. Improving the rendering quality and speed under sparse sampling is important for observing the status and location of lesions. The current methods exhibit inadequate rendering quality in sparse views and suffer from slow rendering speed. To overcome these limitations, we propose TOGS, a Gaussian splatting method with opacity offset over time, which can effectively improve the rendering quality and speed of 4D DSA. We introduce an opacity offset table for each Gaussian to model the opacity offsets of the Gaussian, using these opacity-varying Gaussians to model the temporal variations in the radiance of the contrast agent. By interpolating the opacity offset table, the opacity variation of the Gaussian at different time points can be determined. This enables us to render the 2D DSA image at that specific moment. Additionally, we introduced a Smooth loss term in the loss function to mitigate overfitting issues that may arise in the model when dealing with sparse view scenarios. During the training phase, we randomly prune Gaussians, thereby reducing the storage overhead of the model. The experimental results demonstrate that compared to previous methods, this model achieves state-of-the-art render quality under the same number of training views. Additionally, it enables real-time rendering while maintaining low storage overhead. The code is available at https://github.com/hustvl/TOGS.</p></details> |  |
| **[LiTelFuzz : Swarms Fuzzing Based on Linear Temporal Logic Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04736v1)** | 2024-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-robot swarms utilize swarm intelligence to collaborate on tasks and play an increasingly significant role in a variety of practical scenarios. However, due to the complex design, multi-robot swarm systems often have vulnerabilities caused by logical errors, which can severely disrupt the normal operations of multi-robot swarms. Despite the significant security threats that logical vulnerabilities pose to multi-robot swarms, there are still considerable challenges in testing and identifying these vulnerabilities, and related research still faces two major challenges: 1) the explosion of input space for testing, 2) the lack of effective test-guidance strategies. Therefore, in this paper, we overcome the two major challenges mentioned above, and propose a formal verification method to discover logical flaws in multi-robot swarms. Specifically, we abstract linear temporal logic constraints of the swarm and compute swarm robustness based on these constraints thus guiding fuzzing, we call this approach LiTelFuzz (Fuzzing based on Linear Temporal Logic Constraints). The core idea of LiTelFuzz is to design a metric based on behavioral constraints to assess the state of the multi-robot swarm at different moments, and guide fuzz testing based on the assessment results. Based on this idea, we overcome the two challenges of excessive test case input space and the lack of fuzzing guidance. Consequently, we implement a single attack drone fuzzing scheme and a multiple attack drones scheme based on LiTelFuzz. These are named SA-Fuzzing and MA-Fuzzing, respectively. Finally, we tested three popular swarm algorithms using LiTelFuzz with an average success rate of 87.35% for SA-Fuzzing and 91.73% for MA-Fuzzing to find vulnerabilities. The success rate and efficiency are better than the existing state-of-the-art fuzzer SWARMFLAWFINDER.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to USENIX security'25</p></details> |

Previous works generally provide isolated solutions for either recognition or prediction, which not only increases the complexity of integration in practical applications, but more importantly, cannot exploit the synergy of both sides and suffer suboptimal performances in their respective domains. To address this problem, we propose a generative Transformer VAE architecture to model hand pose and action, where the encoder and decoder capture recognition and prediction respectively, and their connection through the VAE bottleneck mandates the learning of consistent hand motion from the past to the future and vice versa. Furthermore, to faithfully model the semantic dependency and different temporal granularity of hand pose and action, we decompose the framework into two cascaded VAE blocks: the first and latter blocks respectively model the short-span poses and long-span action, and are connected by a mid-level feature representing a sub-second series of hand poses. This decomposition into block cascades facilitates capturing both short-term and long-term temporal regularity in pose and action modeling, and enables training two blocks separately to fully utilize datasets with annotations of different temporal granularities. We train and evaluate our framework across multiple datasets; results show that our joint modeling of recognition and prediction improves over isolated solutions, and that our semantic and temporal hierarchy facilitates long-term pose and action modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV HANDS Workshop 2024</p></details> |

A powerful model is expected to be capable of capturing region-object correspondences and recognizing scene changes in a video clip, reflecting spatial and temporal granularity, respectively. To strengthen model's understanding into such fine-grained details, we propose a simple yet effective video-language modeling framework, S-ViLM, by exploiting the intrinsic structures of these two modalities. It includes two novel designs, inter-clip spatial grounding and intra-clip temporal grouping, to promote learning region-object alignment and temporal-aware features, simultaneously. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that S-ViLM performs favorably against existing approaches in learning more expressive representations. Specifically, S-ViLM surpasses the state-of-the-art methods substantially on four representative downstream tasks, covering text-video retrieval, video question answering, video action recognition, and temporal action localization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR2024, see https://openreview.net/forum?id=5dlfiJIXoh for more details</p></details> |

A video tutorial for this library is available on YouTube. We consider two types of methods to estimate a non-homogeneous Poisson process in space and time. The methods approximate the arrival intensity function of the Poisson process by discretizing space and time, and estimating arrival intensity as a function of subregion and time interval. With such methods, it is typical that the dimension of the estimator is large relative to the amount of data, and therefore the performance of the estimator can be improved by using additional data. The first method uses additional data to add a regularization term to the likelihood function for calibrating the intensity of the Poisson process. The second method uses additional data to estimate arrival intensity as a function of covariates. We describe a Python package to perform various types of space and time discretization. We also describe two packages for the calibration of the models, one in Matlab and one in C++. We demonstrate the advantages of our methods compared to basic maximum likelihood estimation with simulated and real data. The experiments with real data calibrate models of the arrival process of emergencies to be handled by the Rio de Janeiro emergency medical service.</p></details> |  |
| **[Future Does Matter: Boosting 3D Object Detection with Temporal Motion Estimation in Point Cloud Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04390v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and robust LiDAR 3D object detection is essential for comprehensive scene understanding in autonomous driving. Despite its importance, LiDAR detection performance is limited by inherent constraints of point cloud data, particularly under conditions of extended distances and occlusions. Recently, temporal aggregation has been proven to significantly enhance detection accuracy by fusing multi-frame viewpoint information and enriching the spatial representation of objects. In this work, we introduce a novel LiDAR 3D object detection framework, namely LiSTM, to facilitate spatial-temporal feature learning with cross-frame motion forecasting information. We aim to improve the spatial-temporal interpretation capabilities of the LiDAR detector by incorporating a dynamic prior, generated from a non-learnable motion estimation model. Specifically, Motion-Guided Feature Aggregation (MGFA) is proposed to utilize the object trajectory from previous and future motion states to model spatial-temporal correlations into gaussian heatmap over a driving sequence. This motion-based heatmap then guides the temporal feature fusion, enriching the proposed object features. Moreover, we design a Dual Correlation Weighting Module (DCWM) that effectively facilitates the interaction between past and prospective frames through scene- and channel-wise feature abstraction. In the end, a cascade cross-attention-based decoder is employed to refine the 3D prediction. We have conducted experiments on the Waymo and nuScenes datasets to demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior 3D detection performance with effective spatial-temporal feature learning.</p></details> |  |

Recent findings suggest that TAD performance is dependent on the structural design of transformers rather than on the self-attention mechanism. Building on this insight, we propose a refined feature extraction process through lightweight, yet effective operations. First, we employ a local branch that employs parallel convolutions with varying window sizes to capture both fine-grained and coarse-grained temporal features. This branch incorporates a gating mechanism to select the most relevant features. Second, we introduce a context branch that uses boundary frames as key-value pairs to analyze their relationship with the central frame through cross-attention. The proposed method captures temporal dependencies and improves contextual understanding. Evaluations of the gating mechanism and context branch on challenging datasets (THUMOS14 and EPIC-KITCHEN 100) show a consistent improvement over the baseline and existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the ECCV 2024 ABAW Workshop</p></details> |

Recently, the forecasting models have employed multi-source data as the multi-modality input, thus improving the prediction accuracy. However, the prevailing methods usually suffer from the desynchronization of multi-source variables, the insufficient capability of capturing spatio-temporal dependency, and unsatisfactory performance in predicting extreme precipitation events. To fix these problems, we propose a short-term precipitation forecasting model based on spatio-temporal alignment attention, with SATA as the temporal alignment module and STAU as the spatio-temporal feature extractor to filter high-pass features from precipitation signals and capture multi-term temporal dependencies. Based on satellite and ERA5 data from the southwestern region of China, our model achieves improvements of 12.61\% in terms of RMSE, in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modelling multivariate spatio-temporal data with identifiable variational autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04162v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modelling multivariate spatio-temporal data with complex dependency structures is a challenging task but can be simplified by assuming that the original variables are generated from independent latent components. If these components are found, they can be modelled univariately. Blind source separation aims to recover the latent components by estimating the unmixing transformation based on the observed data only. The current methods for spatio-temporal blind source separation are restricted to linear unmixing, and nonlinear variants have not been implemented. In this paper, we extend identifiable variational autoencoder to the nonlinear nonstationary spatio-temporal blind source separation setting and demonstrate its performance using comprehensive simulation studies. Additionally, we introduce two alternative methods for the latent dimension estimation, which is a crucial task in order to obtain the correct latent representation. Finally, we illustrate the proposed methods using a meteorological application, where we estimate the latent dimension and the latent components, interpret the components, and show how nonstationarity can be accounted and prediction accuracy can be improved by using the proposed nonlinear blind source separation method as a preprocessing method.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches rely on the assumption that the shape variation of the point clouds and the motion of the objects across neighboring frames are smooth, failing to cope with high temporal variation data. In this paper, we present a novel framework for 3D SOT in point clouds with high temporal variation, called HVTrack. HVTrack proposes three novel components to tackle the challenges in the high temporal variation scenario: 1) A Relative-Pose-Aware Memory module to handle temporal point cloud shape variations; 2) a Base-Expansion Feature Cross-Attention module to deal with similar object distractions in expanded search areas; 3) a Contextual Point Guided Self-Attention module for suppressing heavy background noise. We construct a dataset with high temporal variation (KITTI-HV) by setting different frame intervals for sampling in the KITTI dataset. On the KITTI-HV with 5 frame intervals, our HVTrack surpasses the state-of-the-art tracker CXTracker by 11.3%/15.7% in Success/Precision.</p></details> | Accepted by ECCV24 |

Designing spatio-temporal forecasting models separately in a task-wise and city-wise manner to forecast demand and supply-demand gap in a ride-hailing system poses a burden for the expanding transportation network companies. Therefore, a multi-task learning architecture is proposed in this study by developing gated ensemble of spatio-temporal mixture of experts network (GESME-Net) with convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and recurrent neural network (RNN) for simultaneously forecasting these spatio-temporal tasks in a city as well as across different cities. Furthermore, a task adaptation layer is integrated with the architecture for learning joint representation in multi-task learning and revealing the contribution of the input features utilized in prediction. The proposed architecture is tested with data from Didi Chuxing for: (i) simultaneously forecasting demand and supply-demand gap in Beijing, and (ii) simultaneously forecasting demand across Chengdu and Xian. In both scenarios, models from our proposed architecture outperformed the single-task and multi-task deep learning benchmarks and ensemble-based machine learning algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2012.08868</p></details> |

However, due to the heterogeneous feature distributions in cross-modalities, designing an effective model for feature alignment and knowledge transfer between linguistic and acoustic sequences remains a challenging task. Optimal transport (OT), which efficiently measures probability distribution discrepancies, holds great potential for aligning and transferring knowledge between acoustic and linguistic modalities. Nonetheless, the original OT treats acoustic and linguistic feature sequences as two unordered sets in alignment and neglects temporal order information during OT coupling estimation. Consequently, a time-consuming pretraining stage is required to learn a good alignment between the acoustic and linguistic representations. In this paper, we propose a Temporal Order Preserved OT (TOT)-based Cross-modal Alignment and Knowledge Transfer (CAKT) (TOT-CAKT) for ASR. In the TOT-CAKT, local neighboring frames of acoustic sequences are smoothly mapped to neighboring regions of linguistic sequences, preserving their temporal order relationship in feature alignment and matching. With the TOT-CAKT model framework, we conduct Mandarin ASR experiments with a pretrained Chinese PLM for linguistic knowledge transfer. Our results demonstrate that the proposed TOT-CAKT significantly improves ASR performance compared to several state-of-the-art models employing linguistic knowledge transfer, and addresses the weaknesses of the original OT-based method in sequential feature alignment for ASR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE SLT 2024</p></details> |

Although adopting a surrogate gradient (SG) makes the non-differentiability SNN trainable, achieving comparable accuracy for ANNs and keeping low-power features simultaneously is still tricky. In this paper, we proposed an energy-efficient spike-train level spiking neural network with spatio-temporal conversion, which has low computational cost and high accuracy. In the STCSNN, spatio-temporal conversion blocks (STCBs) are proposed to keep the low power features of SNNs and improve accuracy. However, STCSNN cannot adopt backpropagation algorithms directly due to the non-differentiability nature of spike trains. We proposed a suitable learning rule for STCSNNs by deducing the equivalent gradient of STCB. We evaluate the proposed STCSNN on static and neuromorphic datasets, including Fashion-Mnist, Cifar10, Cifar100, TinyImageNet, and DVS-Cifar10. The experiment results show that our proposed STCSNN outperforms the state-of-the-art accuracy on nearly all datasets, using fewer time steps and being highly energy-efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neurocomputing on 10 August 2024</p></details> |

To effectively extract sufficient characteristics of the multichannel EEG, a novel decoding architecture network with a dual-branch temporal-spectral-spatial transformer (Dual-TSST) is proposed in this study. Specifically, by utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on different branches, the proposed processing network first extracts the temporal-spatial features of the original EEG and the temporal-spectral-spatial features of time-frequency domain data converted by wavelet transformation, respectively. These perceived features are then integrated by a feature fusion block, serving as the input of the transformer to capture the global long-range dependencies entailed in the non-stationary EEG, and being classified via the global average pooling and multi-layer perceptron blocks. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approach, the competitive experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets of BCI IV 2a, BCI IV 2b, and SEED, with the head-to-head comparison of more than ten other state-of-the-art methods. As a result, our proposed Dual-TSST performs superiorly in various tasks, which achieves the promising EEG classification performance of average accuracy of 80.67% in BCI IV 2a, 88.64% in BCI IV 2b, and 96.65% in SEED, respectively. Extensive ablation experiments conducted between the Dual-TSST and comparative baseline model also reveal the enhanced decoding performance with each module of our proposed method. This study provides a new approach to high-performance EEG decoding, and has great potential for future CNN-Transformer based applications.</p></details> |  |

Recently, there has been a growing interest in adapting image pre-trained MLLMs for video-related tasks. However, most efforts concentrate on enhancing the vision encoder and projector components, while the core part, Large Language Models (LLMs), remains comparatively under-explored. In this paper, we propose two strategies to enhance the model's capability in video understanding tasks by improving inter-layer attention computation in LLMs. Specifically, the first approach focuses on the enhancement of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) with Temporal-Aware Dual RoPE, which introduces temporal position information to strengthen the MLLM's temporal modeling capabilities while preserving the relative position relationships of both visual and text tokens. The second approach involves enhancing the Attention Mask with the Frame-wise Block Causal Attention Mask, a simple yet effective method that broadens visual token interactions within and across video frames while maintaining the causal inference mechanism. Based on these proposed methods, we adapt LLaVA for video understanding tasks, naming it Temporal-Considered LLaVA (TC-LLaVA). Our TC-LLaVA achieves new state-of-the-art performance across various video understanding benchmarks with only supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on video-related datasets.</p></details> |  |

Despite the success of existing Ctrl methods, they require either directly observing the domain variables or assuming a Markov prior on them. Such requirements limit the application of these methods in real-world scenarios when we do not have such prior knowledge of the domain variables. To address this problem, this work adopts a sparse transition assumption, aligned with intuitive human understanding, and presents identifiability results from a theoretical perspective. In particular, we explore under what conditions on the significance of the variability of the transitions we can build a model to identify the distribution shifts. Based on the theoretical result, we introduce a novel framework, Causal Temporal Representation Learning with Nonstationary Sparse Transition (CtrlNS), designed to leverage the constraints on transition sparsity and conditional independence to reliably identify both distribution shifts and latent factors. Our experimental evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate significant improvements over existing baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Algorithms such as Value Iteration and Temporal Difference (TD) learning have a slow convergence rate and become inefficient in these tasks. When the transition distributions are given, PID VI was recently introduced to accelerate the convergence of Value Iteration using ideas from control theory. Inspired by this, we introduce PID TD Learning and PID Q-Learning algorithms for the RL setting, in which only samples from the environment are available. We give a theoretical analysis of the convergence of PID TD Learning and its acceleration compared to the conventional TD Learning. We also introduce a method for adapting PID gains in the presence of noise and empirically verify its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Symbolic and Subsymbolic Temporal Task Constraints from Bimanual Human Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16953v2)** | 2024-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning task models of bimanual manipulation from human demonstration and their execution on a robot should take temporal constraints between actions into account. This includes constraints on (i) the symbolic level such as precedence relations or temporal overlap in the execution, and (ii) the subsymbolic level such as the duration of different actions, or their starting and end points in time. Such temporal constraints are crucial for temporal planning, reasoning, and the exact timing for the execution of bimanual actions on a bimanual robot. In our previous work, we addressed the learning of temporal task constraints on the symbolic level and demonstrated how a robot can leverage this knowledge to respond to failures during execution. In this work, we propose a novel model-driven approach for the combined learning of symbolic and subsymbolic temporal task constraints from multiple bimanual human demonstrations. Our main contributions are a subsymbolic foundation of a temporal task model that describes temporal nexuses of actions in the task based on distributions of temporal differences between semantic action keypoints, as well as a method based on fuzzy logic to derive symbolic temporal task constraints from this representation. This complements our previous work on learning comprehensive temporal task models by integrating symbolic and subsymbolic information based on a subsymbolic foundation, while still maintaining the symbolic expressiveness of our previous approach. We compare our proposed approach with our previous pure-symbolic approach and show that we can reproduce and even outperform it. Additionally, we show how the subsymbolic temporal task constraints can synchronize otherwise unimanual movement primitives for bimanual behavior on a humanoid robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

| **[An embedding-based distance for temporal graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12843v2)** | 2024-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal graphs are commonly used to represent time-resolved relations between entities in many natural and artificial systems. Many techniques were devised to investigate the evolution of temporal graphs by comparing their state at different time points. However, quantifying the similarity between temporal graphs as a whole is an open problem. Here, we use embeddings based on time-respecting random walks to introduce a new notion of distance between temporal graphs. This distance is well-defined for pairs of temporal graphs with different numbers of nodes and different time spans. We study the case of a matched pair of graphs, when a known relation exists between their nodes, and the case of unmatched graphs, when such a relation is unavailable and the graphs may be of different sizes. We use empirical and synthetic temporal network data to show that the distance we introduce discriminates graphs with different topological and temporal properties. We provide an efficient implementation of the distance computation suitable for large-scale temporal graphs.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the favorable properties of Bird's-Eye View (BEV) in point clouds for visual perception, this paper introduces a novel navigation approach named BEVNav. It employs deep reinforcement learning to learn BEV representations and enhance decision-making reliability. First, we propose a self-supervised spatial-temporal contrastive learning approach to learn BEV representations. Spatially, two randomly augmented views from a point cloud predict each other, enhancing spatial features. Temporally, we combine the current observation with consecutive frames' actions to predict future features, establishing the relationship between observation transitions and actions to capture temporal cues. Then, incorporating this spatial-temporal contrastive learning in the Soft Actor-Critic reinforcement learning framework, our BEVNav offers a superior navigation policy. Extensive experiments demonstrate BEVNav's robustness in environments with dense pedestrians, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks. \rev{The code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/LanrenzzzZ/BEVNav.</p></details> |  |

Despite promising progress, existing methods still face challenges in capturing rich temporal context to establish long-term dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical model named SEDMamba, which incorporates the selective state space model (SSM) into surgical error detection, facilitating efficient long sequence modelling with linear complexity. SEDMamba enhances selective SSM with a bottleneck mechanism and fine-to-coarse temporal fusion (FCTF) to detect and temporally localize surgical errors in long videos. The bottleneck mechanism compresses and restores features within their spatial dimension, thereby reducing computational complexity. FCTF utilizes multiple dilated 1D convolutional layers to merge temporal information across diverse scale ranges, accommodating errors of varying duration. Our work also contributes the first-of-its-kind, frame-level, in-vivo surgical error dataset to support error detection in real surgical cases. Specifically, we deploy the clinically validated observational clinical human reliability assessment tool (OCHRA) to annotate the errors during suturing tasks in an open-source radical prostatectomy dataset (SAR-RARP50). Experimental results demonstrate that our SEDMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods with at least 1.82% AUC and 3.80% AP performance gains with significantly reduced computational complexity. The corresponding error annotations, code and models will be released at https://github.com/wzjialang/SEDMamba.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Previous methods such as contrastive-based approaches have made strides in improving sample efficiency but fall short in modeling the nuanced evolution of states. To address this, we introduce MOOSS, a novel framework that leverages a temporal contrastive objective with the help of graph-based spatial-temporal masking to explicitly model state evolution in visual RL. Specifically, we propose a self-supervised dual-component strategy that integrates (1) a graph construction of pixel-based observations for spatial-temporal masking, coupled with (2) a multi-level contrastive learning mechanism that enriches state representations by emphasizing temporal continuity and change of states. MOOSS advances the understanding of state dynamics by disrupting and learning from spatial-temporal correlations, which facilitates policy learning. Our comprehensive evaluation on multiple continuous and discrete control benchmarks shows that MOOSS outperforms previous state-of-the-art visual RL methods in terms of sample efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

| **[Online Detection of Anomalies in Temporal Knowledge Graphs with Interpretability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00872v2)** | 2024-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) are valuable resources for capturing evolving relationships among entities, yet they are often plagued by noise, necessitating robust anomaly detection mechanisms. Existing dynamic graph anomaly detection approaches struggle to capture the rich semantics introduced by node and edge categories within TKGs, while TKG embedding methods lack interpretability, undermining the credibility of anomaly detection. Moreover, these methods falter in adapting to pattern changes and semantic drifts resulting from knowledge updates. To tackle these challenges, we introduce AnoT, an efficient TKG summarization method tailored for interpretable online anomaly detection in TKGs. AnoT begins by summarizing a TKG into a novel rule graph, enabling flexible inference of complex patterns in TKGs. When new knowledge emerges, AnoT maps it onto a node in the rule graph and traverses the rule graph recursively to derive the anomaly score of the knowledge. The traversal yields reachable nodes that furnish interpretable evidence for the validity or the anomalous of the new knowledge. Overall, AnoT embodies a detector-updater-monitor architecture, encompassing a detector for offline TKG summarization and online scoring, an updater for real-time rule graph updates based on emerging knowledge, and a monitor for estimating the approximation error of the rule graph. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate that AnoT surpasses existing methods significantly in terms of accuracy and interoperability. All of the raw datasets and the implementation of AnoT are provided in https://github.com/zjs123/ANoT.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 10 figures.

As a result, many studies focus on efficient fine-tuning. The primary challenge in efficient adaption arises from the inherent differences between image and video modalities. Each sampled video frame must be processed by the image encoder independently, which increases complexity and complicates practical deployment. Although existing efficient methods fine-tune with small trainable parameters, they still incur high inference costs due to the large token number. In this work, we argue that temporal redundancy significantly contributes to the model's high complexity due to the repeated information in consecutive frames. Existing token compression methods for image models fail to solve the unique challenges, as they overlook temporal redundancy across frames. To tackle these problems, we propose Temporal Token Merging (TempMe) to reduce temporal redundancy. Specifically, we introduce a progressive multi-granularity framework. By gradually combining neighboring clips, we merge temporal tokens across different frames and learn video-level features, leading to lower complexity and better performance. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our TempMe. Compared to previous efficient text-video retrieval methods, TempMe significantly reduces output tokens by 95% and GFLOPs by 51%, while achieving a 1.8X speedup and a 4.4% R-Sum improvement. Additionally, TempMe exhibits robust generalization capabilities by integrating effectively with both efficient and full fine-tuning methods. With full fine-tuning, TempMe achieves a significant 7.9% R-Sum improvement, trains 1.57X faster, and utilizes 75.2% GPU memory usage. Our code will be released.</p></details> |  |

Such geolocation data can be leveraged to reconstruct the trajectory of a user's visited Points of Interest (POIs). A key requirement in numerous applications is the ability to measure the similarity between such trajectories, as this facilitates the retrieval of trajectories that are similar to a given reference trajectory. This is the main focus of our work. Existing methods predominantly rely on applying a similarity function to each candidate trajectory to identify those that are sufficiently similar. However, this approach becomes computationally expensive when dealing with large-scale datasets. To mitigate this challenge, we propose TISIS, an efficient method that uses trajectory indexing to quickly find similar trajectories that share common POIs in the same order. Furthermore, to account for scenarios where POIs in trajectories may not exactly match but are contextually similar, we introduce TISIS*, a variant of TISIS that incorporates POI embeddings. This extension allows for more comprehensive retrieval of similar trajectories by considering semantic similarities between POIs, beyond mere exact matches. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms a baseline method based on the well-known Longest Common SubSequence (LCSS) algorithm, yielding substantial performance improvements across various real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Symmetry to Accelerate Learning of Trajectory Tracking Controllers for Free-Flying Robotic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11238v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracking controllers enable robotic systems to accurately follow planned reference trajectories. In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in the synthesis of controllers for systems with complex dynamics and modest online compute budgets. However, the poor sample efficiency of RL and the challenges of reward design make training slow and sometimes unstable, especially for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we leverage the inherent Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional "quotient" MDP to be lifted to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fullyactuated space robot), and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error after the same number of training steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

Pseudo-labeling approaches to semi-supervised learning adopt a teacher-student framework in which machine-generated pseudo-labels on a large unlabeled dataset are used in combination with a small manually-labeled dataset for training. In this work, we address the problem of improving pseudo-label quality through leveraging long-term temporal information captured in driving scenes. More specifically, we leverage pre-trained motion-forecasting models to generate object trajectories on pseudo-labeled data to further enhance the student model training. Our approach improves pseudo-label quality in two distinct manners: first, we suppress false positive pseudo-labels through establishing consistency across multiple frames of motion forecasting outputs. Second, we compensate for false negative detections by directly inserting predicted object tracks into the pseudo-labeled scene. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, improving the performance of standard semi-supervised approaches in a variety of settings.</p></details> |  |

However, the nonlinear optimization solvers required remain too slow for use on relatively resource-constrained flight-grade computers. In this work, we turn towards amortized optimization, a learning-based technique for accelerating optimization run times, and present TOAST: Trajectory Optimization with Merit Function Warm Starts. Offline, using data collected from a simulation, we train a neural network to learn a mapping to the full primal and dual solutions given the problem parameters. Crucially, we build upon recent results from decision-focused learning and present a set of decision-focused loss functions using the notion of merit functions for optimization problems. We show that training networks with such constraint-informed losses can better encode the structure of the trajectory optimization problem and jointly learn to reconstruct the primal-dual solution while yielding improved constraint satisfaction. Through numerical experiments on a Lunar rover problem and a 3-degrees-of-freedom Mars powered descent guidance problem, we demonstrate that TOAST outperforms benchmark approaches in terms of both computation times and network prediction constraint satisfaction.</p></details> |  |

However, predictive modeling of such data remains challenging due to high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and data sparsity. To address these issues, we propose ImageFlowNet, a novel model designed to forecast disease trajectories from initial images while preserving spatial details. ImageFlowNet first learns multiscale joint representation spaces across patients and time points, then optimizes deterministic or stochastic flow fields within these spaces using a position-parameterized neural ODE/SDE framework. The model leverages a UNet architecture to create robust multiscale representations and mitigates data scarcity by combining knowledge from all patients. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We validate ImageFlowNet on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma, demonstrating its ability to effectively forecast disease progression and outperform existing methods. Our contributions include the development of ImageFlowNet, its theoretical underpinnings, and empirical validation on real-world datasets.

This formulation provides a new framework for analyzing and designing feedback control laws. We show that any stable closed-loop system can be expressed in this form with appropriate values for the step size and value matrices. Furthermore, we show that this parameterization of the closed-loop system is equivalent to a linear quadratic regulator for appropriately chosen weighting matrices. We also show that trajectories can be shaped using this approach to achieve a desired closed-loop behavior.</p></details> |  |

Despite its popularity, limited attention has been paid to summarizing the treatment history in the outcome model, which proves particularly challenging when individuals' treatment trajectories exhibit complex patterns over time. Commonly used metrics such as the average treatment level fail to adequately capture the treatment history, hindering causal interpretation. For scenarios where treatment histories exhibit distinct temporal patterns, we develop a new approach to parameterize the outcome model. We apply latent growth curve analysis to identify representative treatment trajectories from the observed data and use the posterior probability of latent class membership to summarize the different treatment trajectories. We demonstrate its use in parameterizing the MSMs, which facilitates the interpretations of the results. We apply the method to analyze data from an existing cohort of lung transplant recipients to estimate the effect of Tacrolimus concentrations on the risk of incident chronic kidney disease.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have discovered that the core idea of our paper overlaps with a previously published work.

| **[Maneuver Decision-Making with Trajectory Streams Prediction for Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10165v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision-making, motion planning, and trajectory prediction are crucial in autonomous driving systems. By accurately forecasting the movements of other road users, the decision-making capabilities of the autonomous system can be enhanced, making it more effective in responding to dynamic and unpredictable environments and more adaptive to diverse road scenarios. This paper presents the FFStreams++ approach for decision-making and motion planning of different maneuvers, including unprotected left turn, overtaking, and keep-lane. FFStreams++ is a combination of sampling-based and search-based approaches, where iteratively new sampled trajectories for different maneuvers are generated and optimized, and afterward, a heuristic search planner is called, searching for an optimal plan. We model the autonomous diving system in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and search for the optimal plan using a heuristic Fast-Forward planner. In this approach, the initial state of the problem is modified iteratively through streams, which will generate maneuver-specific trajectory candidates, increasing the iterating level until an optimal plan is found. FFStreams++ integrates a query-connected network model for predicting possible future trajectories for each surrounding obstacle along with their probabilities. The proposed approach was tested on the CommonRoad simulation framework. We use a collection of randomly generated driving scenarios for overtaking and unprotected left turns at intersections to evaluate the FFStreams++ planner. The test results confirmed that the proposed approach can effectively execute various maneuvers to ensure safety and reduce the risk of collisions with nearby traffic agents.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |
| **[From a Single Trajectory to Safety Controller Synthesis of Discrete-Time Nonlinear Polynomial Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10026v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work is concerned with developing a data-driven approach for learning control barrier certificates (CBCs) and associated safety controllers for discrete-time nonlinear polynomial systems with unknown mathematical models, guaranteeing system safety over an infinite time horizon. The proposed approach leverages measured data acquired through an input-output observation, referred to as a single trajectory, collected over a specified time horizon. By fulfilling a certain rank condition, which ensures the unknown system is persistently excited by the collected data, we design a CBC and its corresponding safety controller directly from the finite-length observed data, without explicitly identifying the unknown dynamical system. This is achieved through proposing a data-based sum-of-squares optimization (SOS) program to systematically design CBCs and their safety controllers. We validate our data-driven approach over two physical case studies including a jet engine and a Lorenz system, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Predictive Planning: Trajectory Planning in Obstruction-Dense Environments for Low-Agility Aircraft](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16024v2)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Model Predictive Planning (MPP), a trajectory planner for low-agility vehicles such as a fixed-wing aircraft to navigate obstacle-laden environments. MPP consists of (1) a multi-path planning procedure that identifies candidate paths, (2) a raytracing procedure that generates linear constraints around these paths to enforce obstacle avoidance, and (3) a convex quadratic program that finds a feasible trajectory within these constraints if one exists. Low-agility aircraft cannot track arbitrary paths, so refining a given path into a trajectory that respects the vehicle's limited maneuverability and avoids obstacles often leads to an infeasible optimization problem. The critical feature of MPP is that it efficiently considers multiple candidate paths during the refinement process, thereby greatly increasing the chance of finding a feasible and trackable trajectory. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MPP on a longitudinal aircraft model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Entry Generalized Search Trees for Indexing Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05327v2)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The idea of generalized indices is one of the success stories of database systems research. It has found its way to implementation in common database systems. GiST (Generalized Search Tree) and SP-GiST (Space-Partitioned Generalized Search Tree) are two widely-used generalized indices that are typically used for multidimensional data. Currently, the generalized indices GiST and SP-GiST represent one database object using one index entry, e.g., a bounding box for each spatio-temporal object. However, when dealing with complex objects, e.g., moving object trajectories, a single entry per object is inadequate for creating efficient indices. Previous research has highlighted that splitting trajectories into multiple bounding boxes prior to indexing can enhance query performance as it leads to a higher index filter. In this paper, we introduce MGiST and MSP-GiST, the multi-entry generalized search tree counterparts of GiST and SP-GiST, respectively, that are designed to enable the partitioning of objects into multiple entries during insertion. The methods for decomposing a complex object into multiple sub-objects differ from one data type to another, and may depend on some domain-specific parameters. Thus, MGiST and MSP-GiST are designed to allow for pluggable modules that aid in optimizing the split of an object into multiple sub-objects. We demonstrate the usefulness of MGiST and MSP-GiST using a trajectory indexing scenario, where we realize several trajectory indexes using MGiST and MSP-GiST and instantiate these search trees with trajectory-specific splitting algorithms. We create and test the performance of several multi-entry versions of widely-used spatial index structures, e.g., R-Tree, Quad-Tree, and KD-Tree. We conduct evaluations using both synthetic and real-world data, and observe up to an order of magnitude enhancement in performance of point, range, and KNN queries.</p></details> |  |

Existing cross-domain policy transfer methods mostly aim at learning domain correspondences or corrections to facilitate policy learning, which requires learning domain/task-specific model components, representations, or policies that are inflexible or not fully reusable to accommodate arbitrary domains and tasks. These issues make us wonder: can we directly bridge the domain gap at the data (trajectory) level, instead of devising complicated, domain-specific policy transfer models? In this study, we propose a Cross-Domain Trajectory EDiting (xTED) framework with a new diffusion transformer model (Decision Diffusion Transformer, DDiT) that captures the trajectory distribution from the target dataset as a prior. The proposed diffusion transformer backbone captures the intricate dependencies among state, action, and reward sequences, as well as the transition dynamics within the target data trajectories. With the above pre-trained diffusion prior, source data trajectories with domain gaps can be transformed into edited trajectories that closely resemble the target data distribution through the diffusion-based editing process, which implicitly corrects the underlying domain gaps, enhancing the state realism and dynamics reliability in source trajectory data, while enabling flexible choices of downstream policy learning methods. Despite its simplicity, xTED demonstrates superior performance against other baselines in extensive simulation and real-robot experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>xTED ...</summary><p>xTED offers a novel, generic, flexible, simple and effective paradigm that casts cross-domain policy adaptation as a data pre-processing problem</p></details> |

One of the main reasons is the computationally long planning times that come with a large state space. Trajectory optimisation algorithms have proved their utility in a wide variety of tasks, but, like most methods struggle scaling to the high dimensional systems ubiquitous to non-prehensile manipulation in clutter as well as deformable object manipulation. We reason that, during manipulation, different degrees of freedom will become more or less important to the task over time as the system evolves. We leverage this idea to reduce the number of degrees of freedom considered in a trajectory optimisation problem, to reduce planning times. This idea is particularly relevant in the context of model predictive control (MPC) where the cost landscape of the optimisation problem is constantly evolving. We provide simulation results under asynchronous MPC and show our methods are capable of achieving better overall performance due to the decreased policy lag whilst still being able to optimise trajectories effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures, accepted to WAFR 2024</p></details> |
| **[Universal Trajectory Optimization Framework for Differential-Driven Robot Class](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07924v1)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential-driven robots are widely used in various scenarios thanks to their straightforward principle, from household service robots to disaster response field robots. There are several different types of deriving mechanisms considering the real-world applications, including two-wheeled, four-wheeled skid-steering, tracked robots, etc. The differences in the driving mechanism usually require specific kinematic modeling when precise controlling is desired. Furthermore, the nonholonomic dynamics and possible lateral slip lead to different degrees of difficulty in getting feasible and high-quality trajectories. Therefore, a comprehensive trajectory optimization framework to compute trajectories efficiently for various kinds of differential-driven robots is highly desirable. In this paper, we propose a universal trajectory optimization framework that can be applied to differential-driven robot class, enabling the generation of high-quality trajectories within a restricted computational timeframe. We introduce a novel trajectory representation based on polynomial parameterization of motion states or their integrals, such as angular and linear velocities, that inherently matching robots' motion to the control principle for differential-driven robot class. The trajectory optimization problem is formulated to minimize complexity while prioritizing safety and operational efficiency. We then build a full-stack autonomous planning and control system to show the feasibility and robustness. We conduct extensive simulations and real-world testing in crowded environments with three kinds of differential-driven robots to validate the effectiveness of our approach. We will release our method as an open-source package.</p></details> | 15 pages, 15 figures |

However, their black-box nature poses significant challenges to closed-loop stability guarantees and performance analysis. In this paper, we introduce a structured DNN-based controller for the trajectory tracking control of Lagrangian systems using backing techniques. By properly designing neural network structures, the proposed controller can ensure closed-loop stability for any compatible neural network parameters. In addition, improved control performance can be achieved by further optimizing neural network parameters. Besides, we provide explicit upper bounds on tracking errors in terms of controller parameters, which allows us to achieve the desired tracking performance by properly selecting the controller parameters. Furthermore, when system models are unknown, we propose an improved Lagrangian neural network (LNN) structure to learn the system dynamics and design the controller. We show that in the presence of model approximation errors and external disturbances, the closed-loop stability and tracking control performance can still be guaranteed. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulations.</p></details> |  |

AdaFold extracts a particle-based representation of cloth from RGB-D images and feeds back the representation to a model predictive control to replan folding trajectory at every time step. A key component of AdaFold that enables feedback-loop manipulation is the use of semantic descriptors extracted from geometric features. These descriptors enhance the particle representation of the cloth to distinguish between ambiguous point clouds of differently folded cloths. Our experiments demonstrate AdaFold's ability to adapt folding trajectories of cloths with varying physical properties and generalize from simulated training to real-world execution.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Interpretability tools could enable users to understand and evaluate possible flaws in learned reward functions. We propose Counterfactual Trajectory Explanations (CTEs) to interpret reward functions in reinforcement learning by contrasting an original with a counterfactual partial trajectory and the rewards they each receive. We derive six quality criteria for CTEs and propose a novel Monte-Carlo-based algorithm for generating CTEs that optimises these quality criteria. Finally, we measure how informative the generated explanations are to a proxy-human model by training it on CTEs. CTEs are demonstrably informative for the proxy-human model, increasing the similarity between its predictions and the reward function on unseen trajectories. Further, it learns to accurately judge differences in rewards between trajectories and generalises to out-of-distribution examples. Although CTEs do not lead to a perfect understanding of the reward, our method, and more generally the adaptation of XAI methods, are presented as a fruitful approach for interpreting learned reward functions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diff-RNTraj: A Structure-aware Diffusion Model for Road Network-constrained Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07369v2)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory data is essential for various applications as it records the movement of vehicles. However, publicly available trajectory datasets remain limited in scale due to privacy concerns, which hinders the development of trajectory data mining and trajectory-based applications. To address this issue, some methods for generating synthetic trajectories have been proposed to expand the scale of the dataset. However, all existing methods generate trajectories in the geographical coordinate system, which poses two limitations for their utilization in practical applications: 1) the inability to ensure that the generated trajectories are constrained on the road. 2) the lack of road-related information. In this paper, we propose a new problem to meet the practical application need, \emph{i.e.}, road network-constrained trajectory (RNTraj) generation, which can directly generate trajectories on the road network with road-related information. RNTraj is a hybrid type of data, in which each point is represented by a discrete road segment and a continuous moving rate. To generate RNTraj, we design a diffusion model called Diff-RNTraj. This model can effectively handle the hybrid RNTraj using a continuous diffusion framework by incorporating a pre-training strategy to embed hybrid RNTraj into continuous representations. During the sampling stage, a RNTraj decoder is designed to map the continuous representation generated by the diffusion model back to the hybrid RNTraj format. Furthermore, Diff-RNTraj introduces a novel loss function to enhance the spatial validity of the generated trajectories. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted as a regular paper at IEEE TKDE</p></details> |
| **[Joint trajectory and network inference via reference fitting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06879v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network inference, the task of reconstructing interactions in a complex system from experimental observables, is a central yet extremely challenging problem in systems biology. While much progress has been made in the last two decades, network inference remains an open problem. For systems observed at steady state, limited insights are available since temporal information is unavailable and thus causal information is lost. Two common avenues for gaining causal insights into system behaviour are to leverage temporal dynamics in the form of trajectories, and to apply interventions such as knock-out perturbations. We propose an approach for leveraging both dynamical and perturbational single cell data to jointly learn cellular trajectories and power network inference. Our approach is motivated by min-entropy estimation for stochastic dynamics and can infer directed and signed networks from time-stamped single cell snapshots.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

Several existing deep generative solutions propose learning from real trajectories to generate synthetic ones. Despite the progress, most of them suffer from training stability issues and scale poorly with growing data size. More importantly, they generally lack control mechanisms to steer the generated trajectories based on spatiotemporal constraints such as fixing specific visits. To address such limitations, we formally define the controlled trajectory generation problem with spatiotemporal constraints and propose Geo-Llama. This novel LLM-inspired framework enforces explicit visit constraints in a contextually coherent way. It fine-tunes pre-trained LLMs on trajectories with a visit-wise permutation strategy where each visit corresponds to a time and location. This enables the model to capture the spatiotemporal patterns regardless of visit orders and allows flexible and in-context constraint integration through prompts during generation. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of Geo-Llama, demonstrating its versatility and robustness in handling a broad range of constraints to generate more realistic trajectories compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[What's Wrong with the Absolute Trajectory Error?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05376v5)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the limitations of the commonly used Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) is that it is highly sensitive to outliers. As a result, in the presence of just a few outliers, it often fails to reflect the varying accuracy as the inlier trajectory error or the number of outliers varies. In this work, we propose an alternative error metric for evaluating the accuracy of the reconstructed camera trajectory. Our metric, named Discernible Trajectory Error (DTE), is computed in five steps: (1) Shift the ground-truth and estimated trajectories such that both of their geometric medians are located at the origin. (2) Rotate the estimated trajectory such that it minimizes the sum of geodesic distances between the corresponding camera orientations. (3) Scale the estimated trajectory such that the median distance of the cameras to their geometric median is the same as that of the ground truth. (4) Compute, winsorize and normalize the distances between the corresponding cameras. (5) Obtain the DTE by taking the average of the mean and the root-mean-square (RMS) of the resulting distances. This metric is an attractive alternative to the ATE, in that it is capable of discerning the varying trajectory accuracy as the inlier trajectory error or the number of outliers varies. Using the similar idea, we also propose a novel rotation error metric, named Discernible Rotation Error (DRE), which has similar advantages to the DTE. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method for calibrating the camera-to-marker rotation, which is needed for the computation of our metrics. Our methods are verified through extensive simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The main part of this manuscript (except the part on DRE) has been accepted to ECCV 2024 Workshop HALF-CENTURY OF STRUCTURE-FROM-MOTION (50SFM)</p></details> |

In this approach, the RCM-constraint is upheld algorithmically, providing flexibility in the positioning of the insertion point and enabling compatibility with a wide range of general-purpose robots. The paper further investigates the impact of the tool's insertion ratio on the RCM-error, and introduces a manipulability index of the robot which considers the RCM-error that it is used to find a starting configuration. To accurately evaluate the proposed method's trajectory tracking within an RCM-constrained environment, an electromagnetic tracking system is employed. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in addressing the RCM constraint problem in RA-MIS.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures.

However, these methods do not model constraints crucial to ensure safety of the learned skill. Moreover, even when explicitly modelling constraints, they rely on the assumption of a known cost function, which limits their practical usability for task with unknown cost. In this work we propose a two-step optimization process that allow to estimate cost and constraints by decoupling the learning of cost functions from the identification of unknown constraints within the demonstrated trajectories. Initially, we identify the cost function by isolating the effect of constraints on parts of the demonstrations. Subsequently, a constraint leaning method is used to identify the unknown constraints. Our approach is validated both on simulated trajectories and a real robotic manipulation task. Our experiments show the impact that incorrect cost estimation has on the learned constraints and illustrate how the proposed method is able to infer unknown constraints, such as obstacles, from demonstrated trajectories without any initial knowledge of the cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>(Acce...</summary><p>(Accepted/In press) 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |
| **[Almost Global Trajectory Tracking for Quadrotors Using Thrust Direction Control on $\mathcal{S}^2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05702v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many of the existing works on quadrotor control address the trajectory tracking problem by employing a cascade design in which the translational and rotational dynamics are stabilized by two separate controllers. The stability of the cascade is often proved by employing trajectory-based arguments, most notably, integral input-to-state stability. In this paper, we follow a different route and present a control law ensuring that a composite function constructed from the translational and rotational tracking errors is a Lyapunov function for the closed-loop cascade. In particular, starting from a generic control law for the double integrator, we develop a suitable attitude control extension, by leveraging a backstepping-like procedure. Using this construction, we provide an almost global stability certificate. The proposed design employs the unit sphere $\mathcal{S}^2$ to describe the rotational degrees of freedom required for position control. This enables a simpler controller tuning and an improved tracking performance with respect to previous global solutions. The new design is demonstrated via numerical simulations and on real-world experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interactive incremental learning of generalizable skills with local trajectory modulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05655v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of generalization in learning from demonstration (LfD) has received considerable attention over the years, particularly within the context of movement primitives, where a number of approaches have emerged. Recently, two important approaches have gained recognition. While one leverages via-points to adapt skills locally by modulating demonstrated trajectories, another relies on so-called task-parameterized models that encode movements with respect to different coordinate systems, using a product of probabilities for generalization. While the former are well-suited to precise, local modulations, the latter aim at generalizing over large regions of the workspace and often involve multiple objects. Addressing the quality of generalization by leveraging both approaches simultaneously has received little attention. In this work, we propose an interactive imitation learning framework that simultaneously leverages local and global modulations of trajectory distributions. Building on the kernelized movement primitives (KMP) framework, we introduce novel mechanisms for skill modulation from direct human corrective feedback. Our approach particularly exploits the concept of via-points to incrementally and interactively 1) improve the model accuracy locally, 2) add new objects to the task during execution and 3) extend the skill into regions where demonstrations were not provided. We evaluate our method on a bearing ring-loading task using a torque-controlled, 7-DoF, DLR SARA robot.</p></details> | 21 pages, 16 figures |

In this paper, we propose a novel trajectory-guided method, the Patch Intensity Convergence (PIC) technique, which generates high-fidelity bounding boxes for UAV detection tasks and no need for the effort required for labeling. The PIC technique forms the foundation for developing UAVDB, a database explicitly created for UAV detection. Unlike existing datasets, which often use low-resolution footage or focus on UAVs in simple backgrounds, UAVDB employs high-resolution video to capture UAVs at various scales, ranging from hundreds of pixels to nearly single-digit sizes. This broad-scale variation enables comprehensive evaluation of detection algorithms across different UAV sizes and distances. Applying the PIC technique, we can also efficiently generate detection datasets from trajectory or positional data, even without size information. We extensively benchmark UAVDB using YOLOv8 series detectors, offering a detailed performance analysis. Our findings highlight UAVDB's potential as a vital database for advancing UAV detection, particularly in high-resolution and long-distance tracking scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, they do not involve explicit reasoning like classic robotics workflow, nor planning with horizons, leading strategies implicit and myopic. In this paper, we introduce our trajectory planning method that uses Behavioral Cloning (BC) for path-tracking and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) bootstrapped by BC for static obstacle nudging. It outputs lateral offset values to adjust the given reference trajectory, and performs modified path for different controllers. Our experimental results show that the algorithm can do path-tracking that mimics the expert performance, and avoiding collision to fixed obstacles by trial and errors. This method makes a good attempt at planning with learning-based methods in trajectory planning problems of autonomous driving.</p></details> | 6 pages, 7 figures |

Parallel prioritized planning offers approximately consistent computation time regardless of the number of vehicles but struggles to guarantee collision-free trajectories. Conversely, sequential prioritized planning can guarantee collision-freeness but results in increased computation time as the number of sequentially computing vehicles, which we term computation levels, grows. This number is determined by the directed coupling graph resulted from the coupling and prioritization of vehicles. In this work, we guarantee safe trajectories in parallel planning through reachability analysis. Although these trajectories are collision-free, they tend to be conservative. We address this by planning with a subset of vehicles in sequence. We formulate the problem of selecting this subset as a graph partitioning problem that allows us to independently set computation levels. Our simulations demonstrate a reduction in computation levels by approximately 64% compared to sequential prioritized planning while maintaining the solution quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Leveraging Moving Sound Source Trajectories for Universal Sound Separation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04843v1)** | 2024-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing methods utilizing spatial information for sound source separation require prior knowledge of the direction of arrival (DOA) of the source or utilize estimated but imprecise localization results, which impairs the separation performance, especially when the sound sources are moving. In fact, sound source localization and separation are interconnected problems, that is, sound source localization facilitates sound separation while sound separation contributes to more precise source localization. This paper proposes a method utilizing the mutual facilitation mechanism between sound source localization and separation for moving sources. Initially, sound separation is conducted using rough preliminary sound source tracking results. Sound source tracking is then performed on the separated signals thus the tracking results can become more precise. The precise trajectory can further enhances the separation performance. This mutual facilitation process can be performed over several iterations. Simulation experiments conducted under reverberation conditions and with moving sound sources demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve more accurate separation based on more precise tracking results.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,7 figures,submitted to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing(TASLP)</p></details> |
| **[Learning Generalizable Tool-use Skills through Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00156v5)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous systems that efficiently utilize tools can assist humans in completing many common tasks such as cooking and cleaning. However, current systems fall short of matching human-level of intelligence in terms of adapting to novel tools. Prior works based on affordance often make strong assumptions about the environments and cannot scale to more complex, contact-rich tasks. In this work, we tackle this challenge and explore how agents can learn to use previously unseen tools to manipulate deformable objects. We propose to learn a generative model of the tool-use trajectories as a sequence of tool point clouds, which generalizes to different tool shapes. Given any novel tool, we first generate a tool-use trajectory and then optimize the sequence of tool poses to align with the generated trajectory. We train a single model on four different challenging deformable object manipulation tasks, using demonstration data from only one tool per task. The model generalizes to various novel tools, significantly outperforming baselines. We further test our trained policy in the real world with unseen tools, where it achieves the performance comparable to human.

Conventional methods of optimizing the spray gun trajectory based on simulated thickness can only qualitatively reflect the color distribution, and can not simulate the color effect of spray painting at the pixel level. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately control the area covered by the color and the gradation of the edges of the area, and it is also difficult to deal with the situation where multiple colors of paint are sprayed in combination. To solve the above problems, this paper is inspired by the Kubelka-Munk model and combines the 3D machine vision method and artificial neural network to propose a spray painting color effect prediction method. The method is enabled to predict the execution effect of the spray gun trajectory with pixel-level accuracy from the dimension of the surface color of the workpiece after spray painting. On this basis, the method can be used to replace the traditional thickness simulation method to establish the objective function of the spray gun trajectory optimization problem, and thus solve the difficult problem of spray gun trajectory optimization for multi-color paint combination spraying. In this paper, the mathematical model of the spray painting color effect prediction problem is first determined through the analysis of the Kubelka-Munk paint film color rendering model, and at the same time, the spray painting color effect dataset is established with the help of the depth camera and point cloud processing algorithm. After that, the multilayer perceptron model was improved with the help of gating and residual structure and was used for the color prediction task. To verify ...</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning Approach to Optimizing Profilometric Sensor Trajectories for Surface Inspection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03429v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-precision surface defect detection in manufacturing is essential for ensuring quality control. Laser triangulation profilometric sensors are key to this process, providing detailed and accurate surface measurements over a line. To achieve a complete and precise surface scan, accurate relative motion between the sensor and the workpiece is required. It is crucial to control the sensor pose to maintain optimal distance and relative orientation to the surface. It is also important to ensure uniform profile distribution throughout the scanning process. This paper presents a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) based approach to optimize robot inspection trajectories for profilometric sensors. Building upon the Boustrophedon scanning method, our technique dynamically adjusts the sensor position and tilt to maintain optimal orientation and distance from the surface, while also ensuring a consistent profile distance for uniform and high-quality scanning. Utilizing a simulated environment based on the CAD model of the part, we replicate real-world scanning conditions, including sensor noise and surface irregularities. This simulation-based approach enables offline trajectory planning based on CAD models. Key contributions include the modeling of the state space, action space, and reward function, specifically designed for inspection applications using profilometric sensors. We use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to efficiently train the RL agent, demonstrating its capability to optimize inspection trajectories with profilometric sensors. To validate our approach, we conducted several experiments where a model trained on a specific training piece was tested on various parts in simulation. Also, we conducted a real-world experiment by executing the optimized trajectory, generated offline from a CAD model, to inspect a part using a UR3e robotic arm model.</p></details> |  |

One of the main challenges in energy management of plug-in HEV is generating State-of-Charge (SOC) reference curves by optimally depleting battery under high uncertainties in driving scenarios. Recent studies have begun to explore the potential of utilizing partial trip information for optimal SOC trajectory planning, but dynamic responses of the FC system are not taken into account. On the other hand, research focusing on dynamic operation of FC systems often focuses on air flow management, and battery has been treated only partially. Our aim is to fill this gap by designing an online trajectory planner for dynamic coordination of FC and battery systems that works with a high-level SOC planner in a hierarchical manner. We propose an iterative LQR based online trajectory planning method where the amount of electricity dischargeable at each driving segment can be explicitly and adaptively specified by the high-level planner. Numerical results are provided as a proof of concept example to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

As a branch of egocentric vision techniques, hand trajectory prediction plays a vital role in comprehending human motion patterns, benefiting downstream tasks in extended reality and robot manipulation. However, capturing high-level human intentions consistent with reasonable temporal causality is challenging when only egocentric videos are available. This difficulty is exacerbated under camera egomotion interference and the absence of affordance labels to explicitly guide the optimization of hand waypoint distribution. In this work, we propose a novel hand trajectory prediction method dubbed MADiff, which forecasts future hand waypoints with diffusion models. The devised denoising operation in the latent space is achieved by our proposed motion-aware Mamba, where the camera wearer's egomotion is integrated to achieve motion-driven selective scan (MDSS). To discern the relationship between hands and scenarios without explicit affordance supervision, we leverage a foundation model that fuses visual and language features to capture high-level semantics from video clips. Comprehensive experiments conducted on five public datasets with the existing and our proposed new evaluation metrics demonstrate that MADiff predicts comparably reasonable hand trajectories compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, and achieves real-time performance. We will release our code and pretrained models of MADiff at the project page: https://irmvlab.github.io/madiff.github.io.</p></details> |  |

This study investigates the potential of LMMs to predict future eGFR levels with a dataset consisting of laboratory and clinical values from 50 patients. By integrating various prompting techniques and ensembles of LMMs, our findings suggest that these models, when combined with precise prompts and visual representations of eGFR trajectories, offer predictive performance comparable to existing ML models.

Recent investigations employing variants of conditional diffusion models in trajectory prediction have exhibited notable success. Nevertheless, the heavy dependence on accurate historical data results in their vulnerability to noise disturbances and data incompleteness. To improve the robustness and reliability, we introduce the Guided Full Trajectory Diffuser (GFTD), a novel diffusion model framework that captures the joint full (historical and future) trajectory distribution. By learning from the full trajectory, GFTD can recover the noisy and missing data, hence improving the robustness. In addition, GFTD can adapt to data imperfections without additional training requirements, leveraging posterior sampling for reliable prediction and controllable generation. Our approach not only simplifies the prediction process but also enhances generalizability in scenarios with noise and incomplete inputs. Through rigorous experimental evaluation, GFTD exhibits superior performance in both trajectory prediction and controllable generation.</p></details> |  |

One fundamental difficulty stands in the evolution of the trajectory that becomes more and more uncertain and unpredictable as the time horizon grows, subsequently increasing the complexity of the problem. To overcome this issue, in this paper, we propose Di-Long, a new method that employs the distillation of a short-term trajectory model forecaster that guides a student network for long-term trajectory prediction during the training process. Given a total sequence length that comprehends the allowed observation for the student network and the complementary target sequence, we let the student and the teacher solve two different related tasks defined over the same full trajectory: the student observes a short sequence and predicts a long trajectory, whereas the teacher observes a longer sequence and predicts the remaining short target trajectory. The teacher's task is less uncertain, and we use its accurate predictions to guide the student through our knowledge distillation framework, reducing long-term future uncertainty. Our experiments show that our proposed Di-Long method is effective for long-term forecasting and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Intersection Drone Dataset (inD) and the Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2024</p></details> |

| **[Fast and Certifiable Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05846v3)** | 2024-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose semidefinite trajectory optimization (STROM), a framework that computes fast and certifiably optimal solutions for nonconvex trajectory optimization problems defined by polynomial objectives and constraints. STROM employs sparse second-order Lasserre's hierarchy to generate semidefinite program (SDP) relaxations of trajectory optimization. Different from existing tools (e.g., YALMIP and SOSTOOLS in Matlab), STROM generates chain-like multiple-block SDPs with only positive semidefinite (PSD) variables. Moreover, STROM does so two orders of magnitude faster. Underpinning STROM is cuADMM, the first ADMM-based SDP solver implemented in CUDA and runs in GPUs (with C/C++ extension). cuADMM builds upon the symmetric Gauss-Seidel ADMM algorithm and leverages GPU parallelization to speedup solving sparse linear systems and projecting onto PSD cones. In five trajectory optimization problems (inverted pendulum, cart-pole, vehicle landing, flying robot, and car back-in), cuADMM computes optimal trajectories (with certified suboptimality below 1%) in minutes (when other solvers take hours or run out of memory) and seconds (when others take minutes). Further, when warmstarted by data-driven initialization in the inverted pendulum problem, cuADMM delivers real-time performance: providing certifiably optimal trajectories in 0.66 seconds despite the SDP has 49,500 variables and 47,351 constraints.</p></details> |  |

| **[Multi-scale Temporal Fusion Transformer for Incomplete Vehicle Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00904v1)** | 2024-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion prediction plays an essential role in autonomous driving systems, enabling autonomous vehicles to achieve more accurate local-path planning and driving decisions based on predictions of the surrounding vehicles. However, existing methods neglect the potential missing values caused by object occlusion, perception failures, etc., which inevitably degrades the trajectory prediction performance in real traffic scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a novel end-to-end framework for incomplete vehicle trajectory prediction, named Multi-scale Temporal Fusion Transformer (MTFT), which consists of the Multi-scale Attention Head (MAH) and the Continuity Representation-guided Multi-scale Fusion (CRMF) module. Specifically, the MAH leverages the multi-head attention mechanism to parallelly capture multi-scale motion representation of trajectory from different temporal granularities, thus mitigating the adverse effect of missing values on prediction. Furthermore, the multi-scale motion representation is input into the CRMF module for multi-scale fusion to obtain the robust temporal feature of the vehicle. During the fusion process, the continuity representation of vehicle motion is first extracted across time steps to guide the fusion, ensuring that the resulting temporal feature incorporates both detailed information and the overall trend of vehicle motion, which facilitates the accurate decoding of future trajectory that is consistent with the vehicle's motion trend. We evaluate the proposed model on four datasets derived from highway and urban traffic scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate its superior performance in the incomplete vehicle trajectory prediction task compared with state-of-the-art models, e.g., a comprehensive performance improvement of more than 39% on the HighD dataset.</p></details> |  |

In scenarios where online interactions are impractical, offline RL, which trains the agent using pre-collected datasets, has become popular. While this new paradigm presents remarkable effectiveness across various real-world domains, like healthcare and energy management, there is a growing demand to enable agents to rapidly and completely eliminate the influence of specific trajectories from both the training dataset and the trained agents. To meet this problem, this paper advocates Trajdeleter, the first practical approach to trajectory unlearning for offline RL agents. The key idea of Trajdeleter is to guide the agent to demonstrate deteriorating performance when it encounters states associated with unlearning trajectories. Simultaneously, it ensures the agent maintains its original performance level when facing other remaining trajectories. Additionally, we introduce Trajauditor, a simple yet efficient method to evaluate whether Trajdeleter successfully eliminates the specific trajectories of influence from the offline RL agent. Extensive experiments conducted on six offline RL algorithms and three tasks demonstrate that Trajdeleter requires only about 1.5% of the time needed for retraining from scratch. It effectively unlearns an average of 94.8% of the targeted trajectories yet still performs well in actual environment interactions after unlearning. The replication package and agent parameters are available online.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NDSS 2025.

While outdoor trajectory forecasting has received significant attention, indoor forecasting is still an underexplored research area. This paper proposes SITUATE, a novel approach to cope with indoor human trajectory prediction by leveraging equivariant and invariant geometric features and a self-supervised vision representation. The geometric learning modules model the intrinsic symmetries and human movements inherent in indoor spaces. This concept becomes particularly important because self-loops at various scales and rapid direction changes often characterize indoor trajectories. On the other hand, the vision representation module is used to acquire spatial-semantic information about the environment to predict users' future locations more accurately. We evaluate our method through comprehensive experiments on the two most famous indoor trajectory forecasting datasets, i.e., TH\"OR and Supermarket, obtaining state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we also achieve competitive results in outdoor scenarios, showing that indoor-oriented forecasting models generalize better than outdoor-oriented ones.

These raw trajectories, typically collected from various sources such as GPS in cars, personal mobile devices, and public transport, are often sparse and fragmented due to limited sampling rates, infrastructure coverage and data loss. In this context, trajectory recovery aims to reconstruct such sparse raw trajectories into their dense and continuous counterparts, so that fine-grained movement of agents across space and time can be captured faithfully. Existing trajectory recovery approaches typically rely on the prior knowledge of travel mode or motion patterns, and often fail in densely populated urban areas where accurate maps are absent. In this paper, we present a new recovery framework called TrajWeaver based on probabilistic diffusion models, which is able to recover dense and refined trajectories from the sparse raw ones, conditioned on various auxiliary features such as Areas of Interest along the way, user identity and waybill information. The core of TrajWeaver is a novel State Propagation Diffusion Model (SPDM), which introduces a new state propagation mechanism on top of the standard diffusion models, so that knowledge computed in earlier diffusion steps can be reused later, improving the recovery performance while reducing the number of steps needed. Extensive experiments show that the proposed TrajWeaver can recover from raw trajectories of various lengths, sparsity levels and heterogeneous travel modes, and outperform the state-of-the-art baselines significantly in recovery accuracy.

In particular, the encounter of a vehicle with a dilemma zone (DZ) at a roundabout intersection is a pivotal concern. This paper presents an automated system that leverages trajectory forecasting to predict DZ events, specifically at traffic roundabouts. Our system aims to enhance safety standards in both autonomous and manual transportation. The core of our approach is a modular, graph-structured recurrent model that forecasts the trajectories of diverse agents, taking into account agent dynamics and integrating heterogeneous data, such as semantic maps. This model, based on graph neural networks, aids in predicting DZ events and enhances traffic management decision-making. We evaluated our system using a real-world dataset of traffic roundabout intersections. Our experimental results demonstrate that our dilemma forecasting system achieves a high precision with a low false positive rate of 0.1. This research represents an advancement in roundabout DZ data mining and forecasting, contributing to the assurance of intersection safety in the era of autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |

We utilize one of the large language models (LLMs) (i.e., GPT-J) to encode the string format of trajectories and then evaluate the effectiveness of the LLM-based representation for trajectory data analysis. The experiments demonstrate that while the LLM-based embeddings can preserve certain trajectory distance metrics (i.e., the correlation coefficients exceed 0.74 between the Cosine distance derived from GPT-J embeddings and the Hausdorff and Dynamic Time Warping distances on raw trajectories), challenges remain in restoring numeric values and retrieving spatial neighbors in movement trajectory analytics. In addition, the LLMs can understand the spatiotemporal dependency contained in trajectories and have good accuracy in location prediction tasks. This research highlights the need for improvement in terms of capturing the nuances and complexities of the underlying geospatial data and integrating domain knowledge to support various GeoAI applications using LLMs.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

Specifically, we present a novel Conditional RNN(CRNN) for diffusion models to efficiently generate trajectories. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive training method that ensures that the diffusion model generates more traversable trajectories. We evaluate our methods in various outdoor scenes and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms on a Husky robot. In practice, we observe at least a 15% improvement in traveling distance and around a 7% improvement in traversability.</p></details> | 10 pages |

While such discrepancies can be alleviated with more complex models, this often complicates controller design and implementation. By leveraging the fact that many trajectories of interest are periodic, we show that perfect tracking is possible when incorporating a simple observer that estimates and compensates for periodic disturbances. We present the design of the observer and the accompanying tracking MPC scheme, proving that their combination achieves zero tracking error asymptotically, regardless of the complexity of the unmodelled dynamics. We validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating asymptotically perfect tracking on a high-dimensional soft robot with nearly 10,000 states and a fivefold reduction in tracking errors compared to a baseline MPC on small-scale autonomous race car experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures; 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024)</p></details> |

We formulate an expression for the information gathered over an observation period based on the mutual information between augmented observer/target states and the associated measurement set collected. We then develop an optimal trajectory design problem for a mobile observer, balancing information gain and control effort, and solve this problem with a Sequential Convex Programming (SCP) approach. The developed methods are demonstrated in scenarios involving spacecraft in the cislunar regime, demonstrating the potential for improved autonomous navigation and tracking.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference</p></details> |

However, it is challenging to obtain sufficiently accurate representations of the environmental dynamics due to uncertainties in complex systems and environments. An inaccurate environment model may degrade the sample efficiency and performance of model-based RL. Furthermore, while model-based RL can improve sample efficiency, it often still requires substantial training time to learn from scratch, potentially limiting its advantages over model-free approaches. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a knowledge-informed model-based residual reinforcement learning framework aimed at enhancing learning efficiency by infusing established expert knowledge into the learning process and avoiding the issue of beginning from zero. Our approach integrates traffic expert knowledge into a virtual environment model, employing the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) for basic dynamics and neural networks for residual dynamics, thus ensuring adaptability to complex scenarios. We propose a novel strategy that combines traditional control methods with residual RL, facilitating efficient learning and policy optimization without the need to learn from scratch. The proposed approach is applied to CAV trajectory control tasks for the dissipation of stop-and-go waves in mixed traffic flow. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach enables the CAV agent to achieve superior performance in trajectory control compared to the baseline agents in terms of sample efficiency, traffic flow smoothness and traffic mobility.

First, a novel multivariable fixed-time disturbance observer is proposed to estimate the lumped disturbances. The bi-limit homogeneity and Lyapunov techniques are employed to ensure the convergence of estimation error within a fixed convergence time, independent of the initial estimation error. Then, an observerbased model predictive control strategy is formulated to achieve robust trajectory tracking of quadrotor, attenuating the lumped disturbances and model uncertainties. Finally, simulations and real-world experiments are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Forecasting through Low-Rank Adaptation of Discrete Latent Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20743v2)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory forecasting is crucial for video surveillance analytics, as it enables the anticipation of future movements for a set of agents, e.g. basketball players engaged in intricate interactions with long-term intentions. Deep generative models offer a natural learning approach for trajectory forecasting, yet they encounter difficulties in achieving an optimal balance between sampling fidelity and diversity. We address this challenge by leveraging Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs), which utilize a discrete latent space to tackle the issue of posterior collapse. Specifically, we introduce an instance-based codebook that allows tailored latent representations for each example. In a nutshell, the rows of the codebook are dynamically adjusted to reflect contextual information (i.e., past motion patterns extracted from the observed trajectories). In this way, the discretization process gains flexibility, leading to improved reconstructions. Notably, instance-level dynamics are injected into the codebook through low-rank updates, which restrict the customization of the codebook to a lower dimension space. The resulting discrete space serves as the basis of the subsequent step, which regards the training of a diffusion-based predictive model. We show that such a two-fold framework, augmented with instance-level discretization, leads to accurate and diverse forecasts, yielding state-of-the-art performance on three established benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

To this end, we provide a novel asynchronous spatial-temporal allocation method. Specifically, between a pair of agents, the allocation is proposed to determine their corresponding derivable time-stamped space and can be updated in an asynchronous way, by inserting a waiting duration between two consecutive replanning steps. Via theoretical analysis, the inter-agent collision is proved to be avoided and the allocation ensures timely updates. Comprehensive simulations and comparisons with five baselines validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and illustrate its improvement in completion time and moving distance. Finally, hardware experiments are carried out, where $8$ heterogeneous unmanned ground vehicles with onboard computation navigate in cluttered scenarios with high agility.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Given the heavy reliance of current trajectory forecasting models on data-driven methodologies, we aim to tackle the challenge of learning general trajectory forecasting representations under limited data availability. We propose a pipeline-level solution to mitigate the issue of data scarcity in trajectory forecasting. The solution is composed of two parts: firstly, we adopt HD map augmentation and trajectory synthesis for generating driving data, and then we learn representations by pre-training on them. Specifically, we apply vector transformations to reshape the maps, and then employ a rule-based model to generate trajectories on both original and augmented scenes; thus enlarging the driving data without collecting additional real ones. To foster the learning of general representations within this augmented dataset, we comprehensively explore the different pre-training strategies, including extending the concept of a Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) for trajectory forecasting. Without bells and whistles, our proposed pipeline-level solution is general, simple, yet effective: we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our data expansion and pre-training strategies, which outperform the baseline prediction model by large margins, e.g. 5.04%, 3.84% and 8.30% in terms of $MR_6$, $minADE_6$ and $minFDE_6$.

| **[Distribution Backtracking Builds A Faster Convergence Trajectory for One-step Diffusion Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15991v1)** | 2024-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accelerating the sampling speed of diffusion models remains a significant challenge. Recent score distillation methods distill a heavy teacher model into an one-step student generator, which is optimized by calculating the difference between the two score functions on the samples generated by the student model. However, there is a score mismatch issue in the early stage of the distillation process, because existing methods mainly focus on using the endpoint of pre-trained diffusion models as teacher models, overlooking the importance of the convergence trajectory between the student generator and the teacher model. To address this issue, we extend the score distillation process by introducing the entire convergence trajectory of teacher models and propose Distribution Backtracking Distillation (DisBack) for distilling student generators. DisBask is composed of two stages: Degradation Recording and Distribution Backtracking. Degradation Recording is designed to obtain the convergence trajectory of teacher models, which records the degradation path from the trained teacher model to the untrained initial student generator. The degradation path implicitly represents the intermediate distributions of teacher models. Then Distribution Backtracking trains a student generator to backtrack the intermediate distributions for approximating the convergence trajectory of teacher models. Extensive experiments show that DisBack achieves faster and better convergence than the existing distillation method and accomplishes comparable generation performance. Notably, DisBack is easy to implement and can be generalized to existing distillation methods to boost performance. Our code is publicly available on https://github.com/SYZhang0805/DisBack.</p></details> |  |

While several CTP methods have been developed for this problem, we posit that none of these methods (1) jointly considers the mutual ternary dependency between three key units (i.e., user, position, and company) of a career and (2) captures the characteristic shifts of key units in career over time, leading to an inaccurate understanding of the job movement patterns in the labor market. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel solution, named as CAPER, that solves the challenges via sophisticated temporal knowledge graph (TKG) modeling. It enables the utilization of a graph-structured knowledge base with rich expressiveness, effectively preserving the changes in job movement patterns. Furthermore, we devise an extrapolated career reasoning task on TKG for a realistic evaluation. The experiments on a real-world career trajectory dataset demonstrate that CAPER consistently and significantly outperforms four baselines, two recent TKG reasoning methods, and five state-of-the-art CTP methods in predicting one's future companies and positions-i.e., on average, yielding 6.80% and 34.58% more accurate predictions, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, inevitable geometric errors can cause severe artifacts in the reconstructed images. The existing calibration method for SMLCT is both crude and inefficient. It involves reconstructing hundreds of images by exhaustively substituting each potential error, and then manually identifying the images with the fewest geometric artifacts to estimate the final geometric errors for calibration. In this paper, we comprehensively and efficiently address the challenging geometric artifacts in SMLCT, , and the corresponding works mainly involve theory, method, and generalization. In particular, after identifying sensitive parameters and conducting some theory analysis of geometric artifacts, we summarize several key properties between sensitive geometric parameters and artifact characteristics. Then, we further construct mathematical relationships that relate sensitive geometric errors to the pixel offsets of reconstruction images with artifact characteristics. To accurately extract pixel bias, we innovatively adapt the Generalized Cross-Correlation with Phase Transform (GCC-PHAT) algorithm, commonly used in sound processing, for our image registration task for each paired symmetric LCT. This adaptation leads to the design of a highly efficient rigid translation registration method. Simulation and physical experiments have validated the excellent performance of this work. Additionally, our results demonstrate significant generalization to common rotated CT and a variant of SMLCT.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Probabilistic Visibility-Aware Trajectory Planning for Target Tracking in Cluttered Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06363v2)** | 2024-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Target tracking has numerous significant civilian and military applications, and maintaining the visibility of the target plays a vital role in ensuring the success of the tracking task. Existing visibility-aware planners primarily focus on keeping the target within the limited field of view of an onboard sensor and avoiding obstacle occlusion. However, the negative impact of system uncertainty is often neglected, rendering the planners delicate to uncertainties in practice. To bridge the gap, this work proposes a real-time, non-myopic trajectory planner for visibility-aware and safe target tracking in the presence of system uncertainty. For more accurate target motion prediction, we introduce the concept of belief-space probability of detection (BPOD) to measure the predictive visibility of the target under stochastic robot and target states. An Extended Kalman Filter variant incorporating BPOD is developed to predict target belief state under uncertain visibility within the planning horizon. To reach real-time trajectory planning, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm to uniformly calculate both BPOD and the chance-constrained collision risk by utilizing linearized signed distance function (SDF), and then design a two-stage strategy for lightweight calculation of SDF in sequential convex programming. Extensive simulation results with benchmark comparisons show the capacity of the proposed approach to robustly maintain the visibility of the target under high system uncertainty. The practicality of the proposed trajectory planner is validated by real-world experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>A tec...</summary><p>A technical report for our conference paper in 2024 American Control Conference (ACC)</p></details> |

Nonetheless, the potential of transformer-based diffusion models for effectively generating videos with controllable motion remains an area of limited exploration. This paper introduces Tora, the first trajectory-oriented DiT framework that concurrently integrates textual, visual, and trajectory conditions, thereby enabling scalable video generation with effective motion guidance. Specifically, Tora consists of a Trajectory Extractor(TE), a Spatial-Temporal DiT, and a Motion-guidance Fuser(MGF). The TE encodes arbitrary trajectories into hierarchical spacetime motion patches with a 3D video compression network. The MGF integrates the motion patches into the DiT blocks to generate consistent videos that accurately follow designated trajectories. Our design aligns seamlessly with DiT's scalability, allowing precise control of video content's dynamics with diverse durations, aspect ratios, and resolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate Tora's excellence in achieving high motion fidelity, while also meticulously simulating the intricate movement of the physical world.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Optimization Trajectories Explain Multi-Task Transfer?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14677v1)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the widespread adoption of multi-task training in deep learning, little is understood about how multi-task learning (MTL) affects generalization. Prior work has conjectured that the negative effects of MTL are due to optimization challenges that arise during training, and many optimization methods have been proposed to improve multi-task performance. However, recent work has shown that these methods fail to consistently improve multi-task generalization. In this work, we seek to improve our understanding of these failures by empirically studying how MTL impacts the optimization of tasks, and whether this impact can explain the effects of MTL on generalization. We show that MTL results in a generalization gap-a gap in generalization at comparable training loss-between single-task and multi-task trajectories early into training. However, we find that factors of the optimization trajectory previously proposed to explain generalization gaps in single-task settings cannot explain the generalization gaps between single-task and multi-task models. Moreover, we show that the amount of gradient conflict between tasks is correlated with negative effects to task optimization, but is not predictive of generalization. Our work sheds light on the underlying causes for failures in MTL and, importantly, raises questions about the role of general purpose multi-task optimization algorithms.</p></details> | Pre-print |

We represent the robot's geometry as a semialgebraic set defined by polynomial inequalities such that robots with general shapes can be suitably characterized. To address the robot navigation task in obstacle-dense environments, we exploit the free space directly to construct a sequence of free regions, and allocate each waypoint on the trajectory to a specific region. Then, we incorporate a uniform scaling factor for each free region, and formulate a Sums-of-Squares (SOS) optimization problem that renders the containment relationship between the robot and the free space computationally tractable. The SOS optimization problem is further reformulated to a semidefinite program (SDP), and the collision-free constraints are shown to be equivalent to limiting the scaling factor along the entire trajectory. In this context, the robot at a specific configuration is tailored to stay within the free region. Next, to solve the trajectory optimization problem with the proposed safety constraints (which are implicitly dependent on the robot configurations), we derive the analytical solution to the gradient of the minimum scaling factor with respect to the robot configuration. As a result, this seamlessly facilitates the use of gradient-based methods in efficient solving of the trajectory optimization problem. Through a series of simulations and real-world experiments, the proposed trajectory optimization approach is validated in various challenging scenarios, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in generating collision-free trajectories in dense and intricate environments populated with obstacles.

We introduce a novel prediction algorithm based on polynomial representations for agent trajectory and road geometry on both the input and output sides of the model. With a much smaller model size, training effort, and inference time, we reach near SotA performance for ID testing and significantly improve robustness in OoD testing. Within our OoD testing protocol, we further study two augmentation strategies of SotA models and their effects on model generalization. Highlighting the contrast between ID and OoD performance, we suggest adding OoD testing to the evaluation criteria of trajectory prediction models.</p></details> |  |

Traditional as well as recent data-driven marginal trajectory prediction methods struggle to properly learn non-linear agent-to-agent interactions. We present SSL-Interactions that proposes pretext tasks to enhance interaction modeling for trajectory prediction. We introduce four interaction-aware pretext tasks to encapsulate various aspects of agent interactions: range gap prediction, closest distance prediction, direction of movement prediction, and type of interaction prediction. We further propose an approach to curate interaction-heavy scenarios from datasets. This curated data has two advantages: it provides a stronger learning signal to the interaction model, and facilitates generation of pseudo-labels for interaction-centric pretext tasks. We also propose three new metrics specifically designed to evaluate predictions in interactive scenes. Our empirical evaluations indicate SSL-Interactions outperforms state-of-the-art motion forecasting methods quantitatively with up to 8% improvement, and qualitatively, for interaction-heavy scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IV-2024. 13 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

However, generating factually consistent responses in knowledge-intensive scenarios remains a challenge due to issues such as hallucination, difficulty in acquiring long-tailed knowledge, and limited memory expansion. This paper introduces SMART, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages external knowledge to enhance the interpretability and factual consistency of LLM-generated responses. SMART comprises four specialized agents, each performing a specific sub-trajectory action to navigate complex knowledge-intensive tasks. We propose a multi-agent co-training paradigm, Long-Short Trajectory Learning, which ensures synergistic collaboration among agents while maintaining fine-grained execution by each agent. Extensive experiments on five knowledge-intensive tasks demonstrate SMART's superior performance compared to widely adopted knowledge internalization and knowledge enhancement methods. Our framework can extend beyond knowledge-intensive tasks to more complex scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/yueshengbin/SMART.</p></details> |  |

Assuming that the vehicle follows a trajectory that can be uniquely identified by the sequence of control inputs and by some intermittent ranging measurements from known points in the environment, we can model the trajectory as a rigid body subject to rotation and translation in the plane. This way, the localisation problem can be reduced to finding the conditions for the existence of a unique roto-translation of the trajectory from a known reference frame to the world reference frame, given the collected measurements. As discussed in this paper, such conditions can be expressed in terms of the shape of the trajectory, of the layout of the ranging sensors, and of the numbers of measurements collected from each of them. The approach applies to a large class of kinematic models. Focusing on the special case of unicycle kinematics, we provide additional local constructibility results.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, This article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control (2024). content may change prior to final publication</p></details> |
| **[Multi-finger Manipulation via Trajectory Optimization with Differentiable Rolling and Geometric Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13229v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameterizing finger rolling and finger-object contacts in a differentiable manner is important for formulating dexterous manipulation as a trajectory optimization problem. In contrast to previous methods which often assume simplified geometries of the robot and object or do not explicitly model finger rolling, we propose a method to further extend the capabilities of dexterous manipulation by accounting for non-trivial geometries of both the robot and the object. By integrating the object's Signed Distance Field (SDF) with a sampling method, our method estimates contact and rolling-related variables and includes those in a trajectory optimization framework. This formulation naturally allows for the emergence of finger-rolling behaviors, enabling the robot to locally adjust the contact points. Our method is tested in a peg alignment task and a screwdriver turning task, where it outperforms the baselines in terms of achieving desired object configurations and avoiding dropping the object. We also successfully apply our method to a real-world screwdriver turning task, demonstrating its robustness to the sim2real gap.</p></details> |  |
| **[A New Perspective to Fish Trajectory Imputation: A Methodology for Spatiotemporal Modeling of Acoustically Tagged Fish Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13220v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The focus of this paper is a key component of a methodology for understanding, interpolating, and predicting fish movement patterns based on spatiotemporal data recorded by spatially static acoustic receivers. For periods of time, fish may be far from the receivers, resulting in the absence of observations. The lack of information on the fish's location for extended time periods poses challenges to the understanding of fish movement patterns, and hence, the identification of proper statistical inference frameworks for modeling the trajectories. As the initial step in our methodology, in this paper, we implement an imputation strategy that relies on both Markov chain and Brownian motion principles to enhance our dataset over time. This methodology will be generalizable and applicable to all fish species with similar migration patterns or data with similar structures due to the use of static acoustic receivers.</p></details> |  |

| **[Differentially Private Spatiotemporal Trajectory Synthesis with Retained Data Utility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12842v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal trajectories collected from GPS-enabled devices are of vital importance to many applications, such as urban planning and traffic analysis. Due to the privacy leakage concerns, many privacy-preserving trajectory publishing methods have been proposed. However, most of them could not strike a good balance between privacy protection and good data utility. In this paper, we propose DP-STTS, a differentially private spatiotemporal trajectory synthesizer with high data utility, which employs a model composed of a start spatiotemporal cube distribution and a 1-order Markov process. Specially, DP-STTS firstly discretizes the raw spatiotemporal trajectories into neighboring cubes, such that the model size is limited and the model's tolerance for noise could be enhanced. Then, a Markov process is utilized for the next location point picking. After adding noise under differential privacy (DP) to the model, synthetic trajectories that preserve essential spatial and temporal characteristics of the real trajectories are generated from the noisy model. Experiments on one real-life dataset demonstrate that DP-STTS provides good data utility. Our code is available at https://github.com/Etherious72/DP-STTS.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |

However, moving MAs results in non-negligible delay, which may decrease the effective data transmission time. To reduce the movement delay, we study in this paper a new MA trajectory optimization problem. In particular, given the desired destination positions of multiple MAs, we aim to jointly optimize their associations with the initial MA positions and the trajectories for moving them from their respective initial to destination positions within a given two-dimensional (2D) region, such that the delay of antenna movement is minimized, subject to the inter-MA minimum distance constraints in the movement. However, this problem is a continuous-time mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem that is challenging to solve. To tackle this challenge, we propose a two-stage optimization framework that sequentially optimizes the MAs' position associations and trajectories, respectively. First, we relax the inter-MA distance constraints and optimally solve the resulted delay minimization problem. Next, we check if the obtained MA association and trajectory solutions satisfy the inter-MA distance constraints. If not satisfied, we then employ a successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm to adjust the MAs' trajectories until they satisfy the given constraints. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of our proposed trajectory optimization method in reducing the movement delay as well as draw useful insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages,6 figures, submit to GLOBECOM 2024 Workshop - IRAFWCC</p></details> |
| **[DBHP: Trajectory Imputation in Multi-Agent Sports Using Derivative-Based Hybrid Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10878v2)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many spatiotemporal domains handle multi-agent trajectory data, but in real-world scenarios, collected trajectory data are often partially missing due to various reasons. While existing approaches demonstrate good performance in trajectory imputation, they face challenges in capturing the complex dynamics and interactions between agents due to a lack of physical constraints that govern realistic trajectories, leading to suboptimal results. To address this issue, the paper proposes a Derivative-Based Hybrid Prediction (DBHP) framework that can effectively impute multiple agents' missing trajectories. First, a neural network equipped with Set Transformers produces a naive prediction of missing trajectories while satisfying the permutation-equivariance in terms of the order of input agents. Then, the framework makes alternative predictions leveraging velocity and acceleration information and combines all the predictions with properly determined weights to provide final imputed trajectories. In this way, our proposed framework not only accurately predicts position, velocity, and acceleration values but also enforces the physical relationship between them, eventually improving both the accuracy and naturalness of the predicted trajectories. Accordingly, the experiment results about imputing player trajectories in team sports show that our framework significantly outperforms existing imputation baselines.</p></details> |  |

To be as efficient as human surveyors, robotic systems must continuously collect observational data required to complete their survey task. Inspection personnel instinctively know to look at relevant equipment that happens to be ``along the way.'' In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for continuous long-horizon viewpoint planning, for ground robots, applied to tasks involving patrolling, monitoring or visual data gathering in known environments. Our approach to Long Horizon Viewpoint Planning (LHVP), enables the robot to autonomously navigate and collect environmental data optimizing for coverage over the horizon of the patrol. Leveraging a quadruped's mobility and sensory capabilities, our LHVP framework plans patrol paths that account for coupling the viewpoint planner for the arm camera with the mobile base's navigation planner. The viewpath optimization algorithm seeks a balance between comprehensive environmental coverage and dynamically feasible movements, thus ensuring prolonged and effective operation in scenarios including monitoring, security surveillance, and disaster response. We validate our approach through simulations and in the real world and show that our LHVP significantly outperforms naive patrolling methods in terms of area coverage generating information-gathering trajectories for the robot arm. Our results indicate a promising direction for the deployment of mobile robots in long-term, autonomous surveying, and environmental data collection tasks, highlighting the potential of intelligent robotic systems in challenging real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, configuring the skills' parameters for a specific task remains a manual and time-consuming endeavor. Existing approaches for learning or optimizing these parameters often require numerous real-world executions or do not work in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose MuTT, a novel encoder-decoder transformer architecture designed to predict environment-aware executions of robot skills by integrating vision, trajectory, and robot skill parameters. Notably, we pioneer the fusion of vision and trajectory, introducing a novel trajectory projection. Furthermore, we illustrate MuTT's efficacy as a predictor when combined with a model-based robot skill optimizer. This approach facilitates the optimization of robot skill parameters for the current environment, without the need for real-world executions during optimization. Designed for compatibility with any representation of robot skills, MuTT demonstrates its versatility across three comprehensive experiments, showcasing superior performance across two different skill representations.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a self-optimizing controller, Type-1 fuzzyPID, which leverages dynamic and static system response analysis to overcome the limitations of manual tuning. To account for system uncertainties, an Interval Type-2 fuzzyPID controller is also developed. Both controllers are designed using Matlab/Simulink and tested through trajectory tracking simulations in the CoppeliaSim environment. Additionally, a non-linear model predictive controller(NMPC) is proposed and compared against the fuzzyPID controllers. The impact of tunable parameters on NMPC tracking accuracy is thoroughly examined. We also present plots of the step-response characteristics and noise rejection experiments for each controller. Simulation results validate the precision and effectiveness of NMPC over fuzzyPID controllers while trading computational complexity.

To tackle this challenge, we propose a progressive 3D editing strategy that ensures multi-view consistency via a Trajectory-Anchored Scheme (TAS) with a dual-branch editing mechanism. Specifically, TAS facilitates a tightly coupled iterative process between 2D view editing and 3D updating, preventing error accumulation yielded from text-to-image process. Additionally, we explore the relationship between optimization-based methods and reconstruction-based methods, offering a unified perspective for selecting superior design choice, supporting the rationale behind the designed TAS. We further present a tuning-free View-Consistent Attention Control (VCAC) module that leverages cross-view semantic and geometric reference from the source branch to yield aligned views from the target branch during the editing of 2D views. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we analyze 2D examples to demonstrate the improved consistency with the VCAC module. Further extensive quantitative and qualitative results in text-guided 3D scene editing indicate that our method achieves superior editing quality compared to state-of-the-art methods. We will make the complete codebase publicly available following the conclusion of the review process.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods often struggle to balance resource conservation, accurate state estimation and precise tracking, resulting in suboptimal performance. This problem is particularly pronounced in environments with large action spaces, where the need for frequent, accurate state data is paramount, yet the capacity for active localization updates is restricted by external limitations. This paper introduces ComTraQ-MPC, a novel framework that combines Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) to optimize trajectory tracking with constrained active localization updates. The meta-trained DQN ensures adaptive active localization scheduling, while the MPC leverages available state information to improve tracking. The central contribution of this work is their reciprocal interaction: DQN's update decisions inform MPC's control strategy, and MPC's outcomes refine DQN's learning, creating a cohesive, adaptive system. Empirical evaluations in simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that ComTraQ-MPC significantly enhances operational efficiency and accuracy, providing a generalizable and approximately optimal solution for trajectory tracking in complex partially observable environments.</p></details> | * Equal contribution |

Understanding the importance of risk factors measured at a mental health visit can help clinicians evaluate future risk and provide appropriate care during the visit. In prediction settings where data are collected over time, such as in mental health care, it is often of interest to understand both the importance of variables for predicting the response at each time point and the importance summarized over the time series. Building on recent advances in estimation and inference for variable importance measures, we define summaries of variable importance trajectories and corresponding estimators. The same approaches for inference can be applied to these measures regardless of the choice of the algorithm(s) used to estimate the prediction function. We propose a nonparametric efficient estimation and inference procedure as well as a null hypothesis testing procedure that are valid even when complex machine learning tools are used for prediction. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed procedures have good operating characteristics. We use these approaches to analyze electronic health records data from two large health systems to investigate the longitudinal importance of risk factors for suicide attempt to inform future suicide prevention research and clinical workflow.</p></details> | <details><summary>81 pa...</summary><p>81 pages (34 main, 47 supplementary), 8 figures (4 main, 4 supplementary), 29 tables (2 main, 27 supplementary)</p></details> |

A common approach to address motion planning problems is trajectory optimization. Trajectory optimization can represent the high-level behaviors of robots through mathematical formulations. However, current trajectory optimization approaches have two main challenges. Firstly, their solution heavily depends on the initial guess, and they are prone to get stuck in local minima. Secondly, they face scalability limitations by increasing the number of constraints. This thesis endeavors to tackle these challenges by introducing four innovative trajectory optimization algorithms to improve reliability, scalability, and computational efficiency. There are two novel aspects of the proposed algorithms. The first key innovation is remodeling the kinematic constraints and collision avoidance constraints. Another key innovation lies in the design of algorithms that effectively utilize parallel computation on GPU accelerators. By using reformulated constraints and leveraging the computational power of GPUs, the proposed algorithms of this thesis demonstrate significant improvements in efficiency and scalability compared to the existing methods. Parallelization enables faster computation times, allowing for real-time decision-making in dynamic environments. Moreover, the algorithms are designed to adapt to changes in the environment, ensuring robust performance. Extensive benchmarking for each proposed optimizer validates their efficacy. Overall, this thesis makes a significant contribution to the field of trajectory optimization algorithms. It introduces innovative solutions that specifically address the challenges faced by existing methods. The proposed algorithms pave the way for more efficient and robust motion planning solutions in robotics by leveraging parallel computation and specific mathematical structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD T...</summary><p>PhD Thesis, University of Tartu, 2024.

Such geolocation data can be leveraged to reconstruct the trajectory of a user's visited Points of Interest (POIs). A key requirement in numerous applications is the ability to measure the similarity between such trajectories, as this facilitates the retrieval of trajectories that are similar to a given reference trajectory. This is the main focus of our work. Existing methods predominantly rely on applying a similarity function to each candidate trajectory to identify those that are sufficiently similar. However, this approach becomes computationally expensive when dealing with large-scale datasets. To mitigate this challenge, we propose TISIS, an efficient method that uses trajectory indexing to quickly find similar trajectories that share common POIs in the same order. Furthermore, to account for scenarios where POIs in trajectories may not exactly match but are contextually similar, we introduce TISIS*, a variant of TISIS that incorporates POI embeddings. This extension allows for more comprehensive retrieval of similar trajectories by considering semantic similarities between POIs, beyond mere exact matches. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms a baseline method based on the well-known Longest Common SubSequence (LCSS) algorithm, yielding substantial performance improvements across various real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in the synthesis of controllers for systems with complex dynamics and modest online compute budgets. However, the poor sample efficiency of RL and the challenges of reward design make training slow and sometimes unstable, especially for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we leverage the inherent Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional "quotient" MDP to be lifted to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fullyactuated space robot), and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error after the same number of training steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

Pseudo-labeling approaches to semi-supervised learning adopt a teacher-student framework in which machine-generated pseudo-labels on a large unlabeled dataset are used in combination with a small manually-labeled dataset for training. In this work, we address the problem of improving pseudo-label quality through leveraging long-term temporal information captured in driving scenes. More specifically, we leverage pre-trained motion-forecasting models to generate object trajectories on pseudo-labeled data to further enhance the student model training. Our approach improves pseudo-label quality in two distinct manners: first, we suppress false positive pseudo-labels through establishing consistency across multiple frames of motion forecasting outputs. Second, we compensate for false negative detections by directly inserting predicted object tracks into the pseudo-labeled scene. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, improving the performance of standard semi-supervised approaches in a variety of settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constraint-Informed Learning for Warm Starting Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14336v2)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future spacecraft and surface robotic missions require increasingly capable autonomy stacks for exploring challenging and unstructured domains, and trajectory optimization will be a cornerstone of such autonomy stacks. However, the nonlinear optimization solvers required remain too slow for use on relatively resource-constrained flight-grade computers. In this work, we turn towards amortized optimization, a learning-based technique for accelerating optimization run times, and present TOAST: Trajectory Optimization with Merit Function Warm Starts. Offline, using data collected from a simulation, we train a neural network to learn a mapping to the full primal and dual solutions given the problem parameters. Crucially, we build upon recent results from decision-focused learning and present a set of decision-focused loss functions using the notion of merit functions for optimization problems. We show that training networks with such constraint-informed losses can better encode the structure of the trajectory optimization problem and jointly learn to reconstruct the primal-dual solution while yielding improved constraint satisfaction. Through numerical experiments on a Lunar rover problem and a 3-degrees-of-freedom Mars powered descent guidance problem, we demonstrate that TOAST outperforms benchmark approaches in terms of both computation times and network prediction constraint satisfaction.</p></details> |  |

However, predictive modeling of such data remains challenging due to high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and data sparsity. To address these issues, we propose ImageFlowNet, a novel model designed to forecast disease trajectories from initial images while preserving spatial details. ImageFlowNet first learns multiscale joint representation spaces across patients and time points, then optimizes deterministic or stochastic flow fields within these spaces using a position-parameterized neural ODE/SDE framework. The model leverages a UNet architecture to create robust multiscale representations and mitigates data scarcity by combining knowledge from all patients. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We validate ImageFlowNet on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma, demonstrating its ability to effectively forecast disease progression and outperform existing methods. Our contributions include the development of ImageFlowNet, its theoretical underpinnings, and empirical validation on real-world datasets.

This formulation provides a new framework for analyzing and designing feedback control laws. We show that any stable closed-loop system can be expressed in this form with appropriate values for the step size and value matrices. Furthermore, we show that this parameterization of the closed-loop system is equivalent to a linear quadratic regulator for appropriately chosen weighting matrices. We also show that trajectories can be shaped using this approach to achieve a desired closed-loop behavior.</p></details> |  |

Despite its popularity, limited attention has been paid to summarizing the treatment history in the outcome model, which proves particularly challenging when individuals' treatment trajectories exhibit complex patterns over time. Commonly used metrics such as the average treatment level fail to adequately capture the treatment history, hindering causal interpretation. For scenarios where treatment histories exhibit distinct temporal patterns, we develop a new approach to parameterize the outcome model. We apply latent growth curve analysis to identify representative treatment trajectories from the observed data and use the posterior probability of latent class membership to summarize the different treatment trajectories. We demonstrate its use in parameterizing the MSMs, which facilitates the interpretations of the results. We apply the method to analyze data from an existing cohort of lung transplant recipients to estimate the effect of Tacrolimus concentrations on the risk of incident chronic kidney disease.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have discovered that the core idea of our paper overlaps with a previously published work.

By accurately forecasting the movements of other road users, the decision-making capabilities of the autonomous system can be enhanced, making it more effective in responding to dynamic and unpredictable environments and more adaptive to diverse road scenarios. This paper presents the FFStreams++ approach for decision-making and motion planning of different maneuvers, including unprotected left turn, overtaking, and keep-lane. FFStreams++ is a combination of sampling-based and search-based approaches, where iteratively new sampled trajectories for different maneuvers are generated and optimized, and afterward, a heuristic search planner is called, searching for an optimal plan. We model the autonomous diving system in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and search for the optimal plan using a heuristic Fast-Forward planner. In this approach, the initial state of the problem is modified iteratively through streams, which will generate maneuver-specific trajectory candidates, increasing the iterating level until an optimal plan is found. FFStreams++ integrates a query-connected network model for predicting possible future trajectories for each surrounding obstacle along with their probabilities. The proposed approach was tested on the CommonRoad simulation framework. We use a collection of randomly generated driving scenarios for overtaking and unprotected left turns at intersections to evaluate the FFStreams++ planner. The test results confirmed that the proposed approach can effectively execute various maneuvers to ensure safety and reduce the risk of collisions with nearby traffic agents.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |

By fulfilling a certain rank condition, which ensures the unknown system is persistently excited by the collected data, we design a CBC and its corresponding safety controller directly from the finite-length observed data, without explicitly identifying the unknown dynamical system. This is achieved through proposing a data-based sum-of-squares optimization (SOS) program to systematically design CBCs and their safety controllers. We validate our data-driven approach over two physical case studies including a jet engine and a Lorenz system, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Predictive Planning: Trajectory Planning in Obstruction-Dense Environments for Low-Agility Aircraft](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16024v2)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Model Predictive Planning (MPP), a trajectory planner for low-agility vehicles such as a fixed-wing aircraft to navigate obstacle-laden environments. MPP consists of (1) a multi-path planning procedure that identifies candidate paths, (2) a raytracing procedure that generates linear constraints around these paths to enforce obstacle avoidance, and (3) a convex quadratic program that finds a feasible trajectory within these constraints if one exists. Low-agility aircraft cannot track arbitrary paths, so refining a given path into a trajectory that respects the vehicle's limited maneuverability and avoids obstacles often leads to an infeasible optimization problem. The critical feature of MPP is that it efficiently considers multiple candidate paths during the refinement process, thereby greatly increasing the chance of finding a feasible and trackable trajectory. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MPP on a longitudinal aircraft model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Entry Generalized Search Trees for Indexing Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05327v2)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The idea of generalized indices is one of the success stories of database systems research. It has found its way to implementation in common database systems. GiST (Generalized Search Tree) and SP-GiST (Space-Partitioned Generalized Search Tree) are two widely-used generalized indices that are typically used for multidimensional data. Currently, the generalized indices GiST and SP-GiST represent one database object using one index entry, e.g., a bounding box for each spatio-temporal object. However, when dealing with complex objects, e.g., moving object trajectories, a single entry per object is inadequate for creating efficient indices. Previous research has highlighted that splitting trajectories into multiple bounding boxes prior to indexing can enhance query performance as it leads to a higher index filter. In this paper, we introduce MGiST and MSP-GiST, the multi-entry generalized search tree counterparts of GiST and SP-GiST, respectively, that are designed to enable the partitioning of objects into multiple entries during insertion. The methods for decomposing a complex object into multiple sub-objects differ from one data type to another, and may depend on some domain-specific parameters. Thus, MGiST and MSP-GiST are designed to allow for pluggable modules that aid in optimizing the split of an object into multiple sub-objects. We demonstrate the usefulness of MGiST and MSP-GiST using a trajectory indexing scenario, where we realize several trajectory indexes using MGiST and MSP-GiST and instantiate these search trees with trajectory-specific splitting algorithms. We create and test the performance of several multi-entry versions of widely-used spatial index structures, e.g., R-Tree, Quad-Tree, and KD-Tree. We conduct evaluations using both synthetic and real-world data, and observe up to an order of magnitude enhancement in performance of point, range, and KNN queries.</p></details> |  |

Existing cross-domain policy transfer methods mostly aim at learning domain correspondences or corrections to facilitate policy learning, which requires learning domain/task-specific model components, representations, or policies that are inflexible or not fully reusable to accommodate arbitrary domains and tasks. These issues make us wonder: can we directly bridge the domain gap at the data (trajectory) level, instead of devising complicated, domain-specific policy transfer models? In this study, we propose a Cross-Domain Trajectory EDiting (xTED) framework with a new diffusion transformer model (Decision Diffusion Transformer, DDiT) that captures the trajectory distribution from the target dataset as a prior. The proposed diffusion transformer backbone captures the intricate dependencies among state, action, and reward sequences, as well as the transition dynamics within the target data trajectories. With the above pre-trained diffusion prior, source data trajectories with domain gaps can be transformed into edited trajectories that closely resemble the target data distribution through the diffusion-based editing process, which implicitly corrects the underlying domain gaps, enhancing the state realism and dynamics reliability in source trajectory data, while enabling flexible choices of downstream policy learning methods. Despite its simplicity, xTED demonstrates superior performance against other baselines in extensive simulation and real-robot experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>xTED ...</summary><p>xTED offers a novel, generic, flexible, simple and effective paradigm that casts cross-domain policy adaptation as a data pre-processing problem</p></details> |

One of the main reasons is the computationally long planning times that come with a large state space. Trajectory optimisation algorithms have proved their utility in a wide variety of tasks, but, like most methods struggle scaling to the high dimensional systems ubiquitous to non-prehensile manipulation in clutter as well as deformable object manipulation. We reason that, during manipulation, different degrees of freedom will become more or less important to the task over time as the system evolves. We leverage this idea to reduce the number of degrees of freedom considered in a trajectory optimisation problem, to reduce planning times. This idea is particularly relevant in the context of model predictive control (MPC) where the cost landscape of the optimisation problem is constantly evolving. We provide simulation results under asynchronous MPC and show our methods are capable of achieving better overall performance due to the decreased policy lag whilst still being able to optimise trajectories effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures, accepted to WAFR 2024</p></details> |
| **[Universal Trajectory Optimization Framework for Differential-Driven Robot Class](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07924v1)** | 2024-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential-driven robots are widely used in various scenarios thanks to their straightforward principle, from household service robots to disaster response field robots. There are several different types of deriving mechanisms considering the real-world applications, including two-wheeled, four-wheeled skid-steering, tracked robots, etc. The differences in the driving mechanism usually require specific kinematic modeling when precise controlling is desired. Furthermore, the nonholonomic dynamics and possible lateral slip lead to different degrees of difficulty in getting feasible and high-quality trajectories. Therefore, a comprehensive trajectory optimization framework to compute trajectories efficiently for various kinds of differential-driven robots is highly desirable. In this paper, we propose a universal trajectory optimization framework that can be applied to differential-driven robot class, enabling the generation of high-quality trajectories within a restricted computational timeframe. We introduce a novel trajectory representation based on polynomial parameterization of motion states or their integrals, such as angular and linear velocities, that inherently matching robots' motion to the control principle for differential-driven robot class. The trajectory optimization problem is formulated to minimize complexity while prioritizing safety and operational efficiency. We then build a full-stack autonomous planning and control system to show the feasibility and robustness. We conduct extensive simulations and real-world testing in crowded environments with three kinds of differential-driven robots to validate the effectiveness of our approach. We will release our method as an open-source package.</p></details> | 15 pages, 15 figures |

However, their black-box nature poses significant challenges to closed-loop stability guarantees and performance analysis. In this paper, we introduce a structured DNN-based controller for the trajectory tracking control of Lagrangian systems using backing techniques. By properly designing neural network structures, the proposed controller can ensure closed-loop stability for any compatible neural network parameters. In addition, improved control performance can be achieved by further optimizing neural network parameters. Besides, we provide explicit upper bounds on tracking errors in terms of controller parameters, which allows us to achieve the desired tracking performance by properly selecting the controller parameters. Furthermore, when system models are unknown, we propose an improved Lagrangian neural network (LNN) structure to learn the system dynamics and design the controller. We show that in the presence of model approximation errors and external disturbances, the closed-loop stability and tracking control performance can still be guaranteed. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through simulations.</p></details> |  |

AdaFold extracts a particle-based representation of cloth from RGB-D images and feeds back the representation to a model predictive control to replan folding trajectory at every time step. A key component of AdaFold that enables feedback-loop manipulation is the use of semantic descriptors extracted from geometric features. These descriptors enhance the particle representation of the cloth to distinguish between ambiguous point clouds of differently folded cloths.

Interpretability tools could enable users to understand and evaluate possible flaws in learned reward functions. We propose Counterfactual Trajectory Explanations (CTEs) to interpret reward functions in reinforcement learning by contrasting an original with a counterfactual partial trajectory and the rewards they each receive. We derive six quality criteria for CTEs and propose a novel Monte-Carlo-based algorithm for generating CTEs that optimises these quality criteria. Finally, we measure how informative the generated explanations are to a proxy-human model by training it on CTEs. CTEs are demonstrably informative for the proxy-human model, increasing the similarity between its predictions and the reward function on unseen trajectories. Further, it learns to accurately judge differences in rewards between trajectories and generalises to out-of-distribution examples. Although CTEs do not lead to a perfect understanding of the reward, our method, and more generally the adaptation of XAI methods, are presented as a fruitful approach for interpreting learned reward functions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diff-RNTraj: A Structure-aware Diffusion Model for Road Network-constrained Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07369v2)** | 2024-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory data is essential for various applications as it records the movement of vehicles. However, publicly available trajectory datasets remain limited in scale due to privacy concerns, which hinders the development of trajectory data mining and trajectory-based applications. To address this issue, some methods for generating synthetic trajectories have been proposed to expand the scale of the dataset. However, all existing methods generate trajectories in the geographical coordinate system, which poses two limitations for their utilization in practical applications: 1) the inability to ensure that the generated trajectories are constrained on the road. 2) the lack of road-related information. In this paper, we propose a new problem to meet the practical application need, \emph{i.e.}, road network-constrained trajectory (RNTraj) generation, which can directly generate trajectories on the road network with road-related information. RNTraj is a hybrid type of data, in which each point is represented by a discrete road segment and a continuous moving rate. To generate RNTraj, we design a diffusion model called Diff-RNTraj. This model can effectively handle the hybrid RNTraj using a continuous diffusion framework by incorporating a pre-training strategy to embed hybrid RNTraj into continuous representations. During the sampling stage, a RNTraj decoder is designed to map the continuous representation generated by the diffusion model back to the hybrid RNTraj format. Furthermore, Diff-RNTraj introduces a novel loss function to enhance the spatial validity of the generated trajectories. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted as a regular paper at IEEE TKDE</p></details> |
| **[Joint trajectory and network inference via reference fitting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06879v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network inference, the task of reconstructing interactions in a complex system from experimental observables, is a central yet extremely challenging problem in systems biology. While much progress has been made in the last two decades, network inference remains an open problem. For systems observed at steady state, limited insights are available since temporal information is unavailable and thus causal information is lost. Two common avenues for gaining causal insights into system behaviour are to leverage temporal dynamics in the form of trajectories, and to apply interventions such as knock-out perturbations. We propose an approach for leveraging both dynamical and perturbational single cell data to jointly learn cellular trajectories and power network inference. Our approach is motivated by min-entropy estimation for stochastic dynamics and can infer directed and signed networks from time-stamped single cell snapshots.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

Several existing deep generative solutions propose learning from real trajectories to generate synthetic ones. Despite the progress, most of them suffer from training stability issues and scale poorly with growing data size. More importantly, they generally lack control mechanisms to steer the generated trajectories based on spatiotemporal constraints such as fixing specific visits. To address such limitations, we formally define the controlled trajectory generation problem with spatiotemporal constraints and propose Geo-Llama. This novel LLM-inspired framework enforces explicit visit constraints in a contextually coherent way. It fine-tunes pre-trained LLMs on trajectories with a visit-wise permutation strategy where each visit corresponds to a time and location. This enables the model to capture the spatiotemporal patterns regardless of visit orders and allows flexible and in-context constraint integration through prompts during generation. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of Geo-Llama, demonstrating its versatility and robustness in handling a broad range of constraints to generate more realistic trajectories compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[What's Wrong with the Absolute Trajectory Error?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05376v5)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the limitations of the commonly used Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) is that it is highly sensitive to outliers. As a result, in the presence of just a few outliers, it often fails to reflect the varying accuracy as the inlier trajectory error or the number of outliers varies. In this work, we propose an alternative error metric for evaluating the accuracy of the reconstructed camera trajectory. Our metric, named Discernible Trajectory Error (DTE), is computed in five steps: (1) Shift the ground-truth and estimated trajectories such that both of their geometric medians are located at the origin. (2) Rotate the estimated trajectory such that it minimizes the sum of geodesic distances between the corresponding camera orientations. (3) Scale the estimated trajectory such that the median distance of the cameras to their geometric median is the same as that of the ground truth. (4) Compute, winsorize and normalize the distances between the corresponding cameras. (5) Obtain the DTE by taking the average of the mean and the root-mean-square (RMS) of the resulting distances. This metric is an attractive alternative to the ATE, in that it is capable of discerning the varying trajectory accuracy as the inlier trajectory error or the number of outliers varies. Using the similar idea, we also propose a novel rotation error metric, named Discernible Rotation Error (DRE), which has similar advantages to the DTE. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method for calibrating the camera-to-marker rotation, which is needed for the computation of our metrics. Our methods are verified through extensive simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The main part of this manuscript (except the part on DRE) has been accepted to ECCV 2024 Workshop HALF-CENTURY OF STRUCTURE-FROM-MOTION (50SFM)</p></details> |

However, these methods do not model constraints crucial to ensure safety of the learned skill. Moreover, even when explicitly modelling constraints, they rely on the assumption of a known cost function, which limits their practical usability for task with unknown cost. In this work we propose a two-step optimization process that allow to estimate cost and constraints by decoupling the learning of cost functions from the identification of unknown constraints within the demonstrated trajectories. Initially, we identify the cost function by isolating the effect of constraints on parts of the demonstrations. Subsequently, a constraint leaning method is used to identify the unknown constraints. Our approach is validated both on simulated trajectories and a real robotic manipulation task. Our experiments show the impact that incorrect cost estimation has on the learned constraints and illustrate how the proposed method is able to infer unknown constraints, such as obstacles, from demonstrated trajectories without any initial knowledge of the cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>(Acce...</summary><p>(Accepted/In press) 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |
| **[Almost Global Trajectory Tracking for Quadrotors Using Thrust Direction Control on $\mathcal{S}^2$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05702v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many of the existing works on quadrotor control address the trajectory tracking problem by employing a cascade design in which the translational and rotational dynamics are stabilized by two separate controllers. The stability of the cascade is often proved by employing trajectory-based arguments, most notably, integral input-to-state stability. In this paper, we follow a different route and present a control law ensuring that a composite function constructed from the translational and rotational tracking errors is a Lyapunov function for the closed-loop cascade. In particular, starting from a generic control law for the double integrator, we develop a suitable attitude control extension, by leveraging a backstepping-like procedure. Using this construction, we provide an almost global stability certificate. The proposed design employs the unit sphere $\mathcal{S}^2$ to describe the rotational degrees of freedom required for position control. This enables a simpler controller tuning and an improved tracking performance with respect to previous global solutions. The new design is demonstrated via numerical simulations and on real-world experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interactive incremental learning of generalizable skills with local trajectory modulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05655v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of generalization in learning from demonstration (LfD) has received considerable attention over the years, particularly within the context of movement primitives, where a number of approaches have emerged. Recently, two important approaches have gained recognition. While one leverages via-points to adapt skills locally by modulating demonstrated trajectories, another relies on so-called task-parameterized models that encode movements with respect to different coordinate systems, using a product of probabilities for generalization. While the former are well-suited to precise, local modulations, the latter aim at generalizing over large regions of the workspace and often involve multiple objects. Addressing the quality of generalization by leveraging both approaches simultaneously has received little attention. In this work, we propose an interactive imitation learning framework that simultaneously leverages local and global modulations of trajectory distributions. Building on the kernelized movement primitives (KMP) framework, we introduce novel mechanisms for skill modulation from direct human corrective feedback. Our approach particularly exploits the concept of via-points to incrementally and interactively 1) improve the model accuracy locally, 2) add new objects to the task during execution and 3) extend the skill into regions where demonstrations were not provided. We evaluate our method on a bearing ring-loading task using a torque-controlled, 7-DoF, DLR SARA robot.</p></details> | 21 pages, 16 figures |

In this paper, we propose a novel trajectory-guided method, the Patch Intensity Convergence (PIC) technique, which generates high-fidelity bounding boxes for UAV detection tasks and no need for the effort required for labeling. The PIC technique forms the foundation for developing UAVDB, a database explicitly created for UAV detection. Unlike existing datasets, which often use low-resolution footage or focus on UAVs in simple backgrounds, UAVDB employs high-resolution video to capture UAVs at various scales, ranging from hundreds of pixels to nearly single-digit sizes. This broad-scale variation enables comprehensive evaluation of detection algorithms across different UAV sizes and distances. Applying the PIC technique, we can also efficiently generate detection datasets from trajectory or positional data, even without size information. We extensively benchmark UAVDB using YOLOv8 series detectors, offering a detailed performance analysis. Our findings highlight UAVDB's potential as a vital database for advancing UAV detection, particularly in high-resolution and long-distance tracking scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

It outputs lateral offset values to adjust the given reference trajectory, and performs modified path for different controllers. Our experimental results show that the algorithm can do path-tracking that mimics the expert performance, and avoiding collision to fixed obstacles by trial and errors.

Parallel prioritized planning offers approximately consistent computation time regardless of the number of vehicles but struggles to guarantee collision-free trajectories. Conversely, sequential prioritized planning can guarantee collision-freeness but results in increased computation time as the number of sequentially computing vehicles, which we term computation levels, grows. This number is determined by the directed coupling graph resulted from the coupling and prioritization of vehicles. In this work, we guarantee safe trajectories in parallel planning through reachability analysis. Although these trajectories are collision-free, they tend to be conservative. We address this by planning with a subset of vehicles in sequence. We formulate the problem of selecting this subset as a graph partitioning problem that allows us to independently set computation levels. Our simulations demonstrate a reduction in computation levels by approximately 64% compared to sequential prioritized planning while maintaining the solution quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures.

In fact, sound source localization and separation are interconnected problems, that is, sound source localization facilitates sound separation while sound separation contributes to more precise source localization. This paper proposes a method utilizing the mutual facilitation mechanism between sound source localization and separation for moving sources. Initially, sound separation is conducted using rough preliminary sound source tracking results. Sound source tracking is then performed on the separated signals thus the tracking results can become more precise. The precise trajectory can further enhances the separation performance. This mutual facilitation process can be performed over several iterations. Simulation experiments conducted under reverberation conditions and with moving sound sources demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve more accurate separation based on more precise tracking results.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,7 figures,submitted to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing(TASLP)</p></details> |

However, current systems fall short of matching human-level of intelligence in terms of adapting to novel tools. Prior works based on affordance often make strong assumptions about the environments and cannot scale to more complex, contact-rich tasks. In this work, we tackle this challenge and explore how agents can learn to use previously unseen tools to manipulate deformable objects. We propose to learn a generative model of the tool-use trajectories as a sequence of tool point clouds, which generalizes to different tool shapes. Given any novel tool, we first generate a tool-use trajectory and then optimize the sequence of tool poses to align with the generated trajectory. We train a single model on four different challenging deformable object manipulation tasks, using demonstration data from only one tool per task. The model generalizes to various novel tools, significantly outperforming baselines. We further test our trained policy in the real world with unseen tools, where it achieves the performance comparable to human.

Conventional methods of optimizing the spray gun trajectory based on simulated thickness can only qualitatively reflect the color distribution, and can not simulate the color effect of spray painting at the pixel level. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately control the area covered by the color and the gradation of the edges of the area, and it is also difficult to deal with the situation where multiple colors of paint are sprayed in combination. To solve the above problems, this paper is inspired by the Kubelka-Munk model and combines the 3D machine vision method and artificial neural network to propose a spray painting color effect prediction method. The method is enabled to predict the execution effect of the spray gun trajectory with pixel-level accuracy from the dimension of the surface color of the workpiece after spray painting. On this basis, the method can be used to replace the traditional thickness simulation method to establish the objective function of the spray gun trajectory optimization problem, and thus solve the difficult problem of spray gun trajectory optimization for multi-color paint combination spraying. In this paper, the mathematical model of the spray painting color effect prediction problem is first determined through the analysis of the Kubelka-Munk paint film color rendering model, and at the same time, the spray painting color effect dataset is established with the help of the depth camera and point cloud processing algorithm. After that, the multilayer perceptron model was improved with the help of gating and residual structure and was used for the color prediction task. To verify ...</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning Approach to Optimizing Profilometric Sensor Trajectories for Surface Inspection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03429v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-precision surface defect detection in manufacturing is essential for ensuring quality control. Laser triangulation profilometric sensors are key to this process, providing detailed and accurate surface measurements over a line. To achieve a complete and precise surface scan, accurate relative motion between the sensor and the workpiece is required. It is crucial to control the sensor pose to maintain optimal distance and relative orientation to the surface. It is also important to ensure uniform profile distribution throughout the scanning process. This paper presents a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) based approach to optimize robot inspection trajectories for profilometric sensors. Building upon the Boustrophedon scanning method, our technique dynamically adjusts the sensor position and tilt to maintain optimal orientation and distance from the surface, while also ensuring a consistent profile distance for uniform and high-quality scanning. Utilizing a simulated environment based on the CAD model of the part, we replicate real-world scanning conditions, including sensor noise and surface irregularities. This simulation-based approach enables offline trajectory planning based on CAD models. Key contributions include the modeling of the state space, action space, and reward function, specifically designed for inspection applications using profilometric sensors. We use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to efficiently train the RL agent, demonstrating its capability to optimize inspection trajectories with profilometric sensors. To validate our approach, we conducted several experiments where a model trained on a specific training piece was tested on various parts in simulation. Also, we conducted a real-world experiment by executing the optimized trajectory, generated offline from a CAD model, to inspect a part using a UR3e robotic arm model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Predictive Online Trajectory Planning for Adaptive Battery Discharging in Fuel Cell Vehicle](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03201v1)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an online trajectory planning approach for optimal coordination of Fuel Cell (FC) and battery in plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV). One of the main challenges in energy management of plug-in HEV is generating State-of-Charge (SOC) reference curves by optimally depleting battery under high uncertainties in driving scenarios. Recent studies have begun to explore the potential of utilizing partial trip information for optimal SOC trajectory planning, but dynamic responses of the FC system are not taken into account. On the other hand, research focusing on dynamic operation of FC systems often focuses on air flow management, and battery has been treated only partially. Our aim is to fill this gap by designing an online trajectory planner for dynamic coordination of FC and battery systems that works with a high-level SOC planner in a hierarchical manner. We propose an iterative LQR based online trajectory planning method where the amount of electricity dischargeable at each driving segment can be explicitly and adaptively specified by the high-level planner. Numerical results are provided as a proof of concept example to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[MADiff: Motion-Aware Mamba Diffusion Models for Hand Trajectory Prediction on Egocentric Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02638v1)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding human intentions and actions through egocentric videos is important on the path to embodied artificial intelligence. As a branch of egocentric vision techniques, hand trajectory prediction plays a vital role in comprehending human motion patterns, benefiting downstream tasks in extended reality and robot manipulation. However, capturing high-level human intentions consistent with reasonable temporal causality is challenging when only egocentric videos are available. This difficulty is exacerbated under camera egomotion interference and the absence of affordance labels to explicitly guide the optimization of hand waypoint distribution. In this work, we propose a novel hand trajectory prediction method dubbed MADiff, which forecasts future hand waypoints with diffusion models. The devised denoising operation in the latent space is achieved by our proposed motion-aware Mamba, where the camera wearer's egomotion is integrated to achieve motion-driven selective scan (MDSS). To discern the relationship between hands and scenarios without explicit affordance supervision, we leverage a foundation model that fuses visual and language features to capture high-level semantics from video clips. Comprehensive experiments conducted on five public datasets with the existing and our proposed new evaluation metrics demonstrate that MADiff predicts comparably reasonable hand trajectories compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, and achieves real-time performance. We will release our code and pretrained models of MADiff at the project page: https://irmvlab.github.io/madiff.github.io.</p></details> |  |

Although traditional equations and Machine Learning (ML) models using clinical and laboratory data can estimate eGFR, accurately predicting future eGFR levels remains a significant challenge for nephrologists and ML researchers. Recent advances demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) can serve as robust foundation models for diverse applications. This study investigates the potential of LMMs to predict future eGFR levels with a dataset consisting of laboratory and clinical values from 50 patients. By integrating various prompting techniques and ensembles of LMMs, our findings suggest that these models, when combined with precise prompts and visual representations of eGFR trajectories, offer predictive performance comparable to existing ML models. This research extends the application of foundation models and suggests avenues for future studies to harness these models in addressing complex medical forecasting challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint version includes corrections of typographical errors related to numerical values in Table 2, which were present in the version published at the BDH workshop in MIPR 2024.

| **[Joint Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction through Posterior Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00237v2)** | 2024-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint pedestrian trajectory prediction has long grappled with the inherent unpredictability of human behaviors. Recent investigations employing variants of conditional diffusion models in trajectory prediction have exhibited notable success. Nevertheless, the heavy dependence on accurate historical data results in their vulnerability to noise disturbances and data incompleteness. To improve the robustness and reliability, we introduce the Guided Full Trajectory Diffuser (GFTD), a novel diffusion model framework that captures the joint full (historical and future) trajectory distribution. By learning from the full trajectory, GFTD can recover the noisy and missing data, hence improving the robustness. In addition, GFTD can adapt to data imperfections without additional training requirements, leveraging posterior sampling for reliable prediction and controllable generation. Our approach not only simplifies the prediction process but also enhances generalizability in scenarios with noise and incomplete inputs. Through rigorous experimental evaluation, GFTD exhibits superior performance in both trajectory prediction and controllable generation.</p></details> |  |

While promising approaches exist, they are often not publicly available, revolve around pedestrian datasets excluding traffic-related information, or resemble architectures that are either not real-time capable or robust. To address these limitations, we first introduce a dedicated benchmark based on Argoverse 2, specifically targeting pedestrians in urban settings. Following this, we present Snapshot, a modular, feed-forward neural network that outperforms the current state of the art while utilizing significantly less information. Despite its agent-centric encoding scheme, Snapshot demonstrates scalability, real-time performance, and robustness to varying motion histories. Moreover, by integrating Snapshot into a modular autonomous driving software stack, we showcase its real-world applicability</p></details> | 8 Pages, 9 Figures |

One fundamental difficulty stands in the evolution of the trajectory that becomes more and more uncertain and unpredictable as the time horizon grows, subsequently increasing the complexity of the problem. To overcome this issue, in this paper, we propose Di-Long, a new method that employs the distillation of a short-term trajectory model forecaster that guides a student network for long-term trajectory prediction during the training process. Given a total sequence length that comprehends the allowed observation for the student network and the complementary target sequence, we let the student and the teacher solve two different related tasks defined over the same full trajectory: the student observes a short sequence and predicts a long trajectory, whereas the teacher observes a longer sequence and predicts the remaining short target trajectory. The teacher's task is less uncertain, and we use its accurate predictions to guide the student through our knowledge distillation framework, reducing long-term future uncertainty. Our experiments show that our proposed Di-Long method is effective for long-term forecasting and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Intersection Drone Dataset (inD) and the Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2024</p></details> |

| **[Fast and Certifiable Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05846v3)** | 2024-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose semidefinite trajectory optimization (STROM), a framework that computes fast and certifiably optimal solutions for nonconvex trajectory optimization problems defined by polynomial objectives and constraints. STROM employs sparse second-order Lasserre's hierarchy to generate semidefinite program (SDP) relaxations of trajectory optimization. Different from existing tools (e.g., YALMIP and SOSTOOLS in Matlab), STROM generates chain-like multiple-block SDPs with only positive semidefinite (PSD) variables. Moreover, STROM does so two orders of magnitude faster. Underpinning STROM is cuADMM, the first ADMM-based SDP solver implemented in CUDA and runs in GPUs (with C/C++ extension). cuADMM builds upon the symmetric Gauss-Seidel ADMM algorithm and leverages GPU parallelization to speedup solving sparse linear systems and projecting onto PSD cones. In five trajectory optimization problems (inverted pendulum, cart-pole, vehicle landing, flying robot, and car back-in), cuADMM computes optimal trajectories (with certified suboptimality below 1%) in minutes (when other solvers take hours or run out of memory) and seconds (when others take minutes). Further, when warmstarted by data-driven initialization in the inverted pendulum problem, cuADMM delivers real-time performance: providing certifiably optimal trajectories in 0.66 seconds despite the SDP has 49,500 variables and 47,351 constraints.</p></details> |  |

| **[Multi-scale Temporal Fusion Transformer for Incomplete Vehicle Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00904v1)** | 2024-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion prediction plays an essential role in autonomous driving systems, enabling autonomous vehicles to achieve more accurate local-path planning and driving decisions based on predictions of the surrounding vehicles. However, existing methods neglect the potential missing values caused by object occlusion, perception failures, etc., which inevitably degrades the trajectory prediction performance in real traffic scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a novel end-to-end framework for incomplete vehicle trajectory prediction, named Multi-scale Temporal Fusion Transformer (MTFT), which consists of the Multi-scale Attention Head (MAH) and the Continuity Representation-guided Multi-scale Fusion (CRMF) module. Specifically, the MAH leverages the multi-head attention mechanism to parallelly capture multi-scale motion representation of trajectory from different temporal granularities, thus mitigating the adverse effect of missing values on prediction. Furthermore, the multi-scale motion representation is input into the CRMF module for multi-scale fusion to obtain the robust temporal feature of the vehicle. During the fusion process, the continuity representation of vehicle motion is first extracted across time steps to guide the fusion, ensuring that the resulting temporal feature incorporates both detailed information and the overall trend of vehicle motion, which facilitates the accurate decoding of future trajectory that is consistent with the vehicle's motion trend. We evaluate the proposed model on four datasets derived from highway and urban traffic scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate its superior performance in the incomplete vehicle trajectory prediction task compared with state-of-the-art models, e.g., a comprehensive performance improvement of more than 39% on the HighD dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajDeleter: Enabling Trajectory Forgetting in Offline Reinforcement Learning Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12530v2)** | 2024-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) trains an agent from experiences interacting with the environment. In scenarios where online interactions are impractical, offline RL, which trains the agent using pre-collected datasets, has become popular. While this new paradigm presents remarkable effectiveness across various real-world domains, like healthcare and energy management, there is a growing demand to enable agents to rapidly and completely eliminate the influence of specific trajectories from both the training dataset and the trained agents. To meet this problem, this paper advocates Trajdeleter, the first practical approach to trajectory unlearning for offline RL agents. The key idea of Trajdeleter is to guide the agent to demonstrate deteriorating performance when it encounters states associated with unlearning trajectories. Simultaneously, it ensures the agent maintains its original performance level when facing other remaining trajectories. Additionally, we introduce Trajauditor, a simple yet efficient method to evaluate whether Trajdeleter successfully eliminates the specific trajectories of influence from the offline RL agent. Extensive experiments conducted on six offline RL algorithms and three tasks demonstrate that Trajdeleter requires only about 1.5% of the time needed for retraining from scratch. It effectively unlearns an average of 94.8% of the targeted trajectories yet still performs well in actual environment interactions after unlearning. The replication package and agent parameters are available online.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NDSS 2025.

While outdoor trajectory forecasting has received significant attention, indoor forecasting is still an underexplored research area. This paper proposes SITUATE, a novel approach to cope with indoor human trajectory prediction by leveraging equivariant and invariant geometric features and a self-supervised vision representation. The geometric learning modules model the intrinsic symmetries and human movements inherent in indoor spaces. This concept becomes particularly important because self-loops at various scales and rapid direction changes often characterize indoor trajectories. On the other hand, the vision representation module is used to acquire spatial-semantic information about the environment to predict users' future locations more accurately. We evaluate our method through comprehensive experiments on the two most famous indoor trajectory forecasting datasets, i.e., TH\"OR and Supermarket, obtaining state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we also achieve competitive results in outdoor scenarios, showing that indoor-oriented forecasting models generalize better than outdoor-oriented ones.

| **[TrajWeaver: Trajectory Recovery with State Propagation Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02124v1)** | 2024-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the proliferation of location-aware devices, large amount of trajectories have been generated when agents such as people, vehicles and goods flow around the urban environment. These raw trajectories, typically collected from various sources such as GPS in cars, personal mobile devices, and public transport, are often sparse and fragmented due to limited sampling rates, infrastructure coverage and data loss. In this context, trajectory recovery aims to reconstruct such sparse raw trajectories into their dense and continuous counterparts, so that fine-grained movement of agents across space and time can be captured faithfully. Existing trajectory recovery approaches typically rely on the prior knowledge of travel mode or motion patterns, and often fail in densely populated urban areas where accurate maps are absent. In this paper, we present a new recovery framework called TrajWeaver based on probabilistic diffusion models, which is able to recover dense and refined trajectories from the sparse raw ones, conditioned on various auxiliary features such as Areas of Interest along the way, user identity and waybill information. The core of TrajWeaver is a novel State Propagation Diffusion Model (SPDM), which introduces a new state propagation mechanism on top of the standard diffusion models, so that knowledge computed in earlier diffusion steps can be reused later, improving the recovery performance while reducing the number of steps needed. Extensive experiments show that the proposed TrajWeaver can recover from raw trajectories of various lengths, sparsity levels and heterogeneous travel modes, and outperform the state-of-the-art baselines significantly in recovery accuracy.

In particular, the encounter of a vehicle with a dilemma zone (DZ) at a roundabout intersection is a pivotal concern. This paper presents an automated system that leverages trajectory forecasting to predict DZ events, specifically at traffic roundabouts. Our system aims to enhance safety standards in both autonomous and manual transportation. The core of our approach is a modular, graph-structured recurrent model that forecasts the trajectories of diverse agents, taking into account agent dynamics and integrating heterogeneous data, such as semantic maps. This model, based on graph neural networks, aids in predicting DZ events and enhances traffic management decision-making. We evaluated our system using a real-world dataset of traffic roundabout intersections. Our experimental results demonstrate that our dilemma forecasting system achieves a high precision with a low false positive rate of 0.1. This research represents an advancement in roundabout DZ data mining and forecasting, contributing to the assurance of intersection safety in the era of autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |

We utilize one of the large language models (LLMs) (i.e., GPT-J) to encode the string format of trajectories and then evaluate the effectiveness of the LLM-based representation for trajectory data analysis. The experiments demonstrate that while the LLM-based embeddings can preserve certain trajectory distance metrics (i.e., the correlation coefficients exceed 0.74 between the Cosine distance derived from GPT-J embeddings and the Hausdorff and Dynamic Time Warping distances on raw trajectories), challenges remain in restoring numeric values and retrieving spatial neighbors in movement trajectory analytics. In addition, the LLMs can understand the spatiotemporal dependency contained in trajectories and have good accuracy in location prediction tasks. This research highlights the need for improvement in terms of capturing the nuances and complexities of the underlying geospatial data and integrating domain knowledge to support various GeoAI applications using LLMs.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

Specifically, we present a novel Conditional RNN(CRNN) for diffusion models to efficiently generate trajectories. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive training method that ensures that the diffusion model generates more traversable trajectories. We evaluate our methods in various outdoor scenes and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms on a Husky robot. In practice, we observe at least a 15% improvement in traveling distance and around a 7% improvement in traversability.</p></details> | 10 pages |

We present the design of the observer and the accompanying tracking MPC scheme, proving that their combination achieves zero tracking error asymptotically, regardless of the complexity of the unmodelled dynamics. We validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating asymptotically perfect tracking on a high-dimensional soft robot with nearly 10,000 states and a fivefold reduction in tracking errors compared to a baseline MPC on small-scale autonomous race car experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures; 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024)</p></details> |

However, it is challenging to obtain sufficiently accurate representations of the environmental dynamics due to uncertainties in complex systems and environments. An inaccurate environment model may degrade the sample efficiency and performance of model-based RL. Furthermore, while model-based RL can improve sample efficiency, it often still requires substantial training time to learn from scratch, potentially limiting its advantages over model-free approaches. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a knowledge-informed model-based residual reinforcement learning framework aimed at enhancing learning efficiency by infusing established expert knowledge into the learning process and avoiding the issue of beginning from zero. Our approach integrates traffic expert knowledge into a virtual environment model, employing the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) for basic dynamics and neural networks for residual dynamics, thus ensuring adaptability to complex scenarios. We propose a novel strategy that combines traditional control methods with residual RL, facilitating efficient learning and policy optimization without the need to learn from scratch. The proposed approach is applied to CAV trajectory control tasks for the dissipation of stop-and-go waves in mixed traffic flow. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach enables the CAV agent to achieve superior performance in trajectory control compared to the baseline agents in terms of sample efficiency, traffic flow smoothness and traffic mobility.

Deep generative models offer a natural learning approach for trajectory forecasting, yet they encounter difficulties in achieving an optimal balance between sampling fidelity and diversity. We address this challenge by leveraging Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs), which utilize a discrete latent space to tackle the issue of posterior collapse. Specifically, we introduce an instance-based codebook that allows tailored latent representations for each example. In a nutshell, the rows of the codebook are dynamically adjusted to reflect contextual information (i.e., past motion patterns extracted from the observed trajectories). In this way, the discretization process gains flexibility, leading to improved reconstructions. Notably, instance-level dynamics are injected into the codebook through low-rank updates, which restrict the customization of the codebook to a lower dimension space. The resulting discrete space serves as the basis of the subsequent step, which regards the training of a diffusion-based predictive model. We show that such a two-fold framework, augmented with instance-level discretization, leads to accurate and diverse forecasts, yielding state-of-the-art performance on three established benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Via theoretical analysis, the inter-agent collision is proved to be avoided and the allocation ensures timely updates. Comprehensive simulations and comparisons with five baselines validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and illustrate its improvement in completion time and moving distance.

Given the heavy reliance of current trajectory forecasting models on data-driven methodologies, we aim to tackle the challenge of learning general trajectory forecasting representations under limited data availability. We propose a pipeline-level solution to mitigate the issue of data scarcity in trajectory forecasting. The solution is composed of two parts: firstly, we adopt HD map augmentation and trajectory synthesis for generating driving data, and then we learn representations by pre-training on them. Specifically, we apply vector transformations to reshape the maps, and then employ a rule-based model to generate trajectories on both original and augmented scenes; thus enlarging the driving data without collecting additional real ones. To foster the learning of general representations within this augmented dataset, we comprehensively explore the different pre-training strategies, including extending the concept of a Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) for trajectory forecasting. Without bells and whistles, our proposed pipeline-level solution is general, simple, yet effective: we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our data expansion and pre-training strategies, which outperform the baseline prediction model by large margins, e.g. 5.04%, 3.84% and 8.30% in terms of $MR_6$, $minADE_6$ and $minFDE_6$.

| **[Distribution Backtracking Builds A Faster Convergence Trajectory for One-step Diffusion Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15991v1)** | 2024-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accelerating the sampling speed of diffusion models remains a significant challenge. Recent score distillation methods distill a heavy teacher model into an one-step student generator, which is optimized by calculating the difference between the two score functions on the samples generated by the student model. However, there is a score mismatch issue in the early stage of the distillation process, because existing methods mainly focus on using the endpoint of pre-trained diffusion models as teacher models, overlooking the importance of the convergence trajectory between the student generator and the teacher model. To address this issue, we extend the score distillation process by introducing the entire convergence trajectory of teacher models and propose Distribution Backtracking Distillation (DisBack) for distilling student generators. DisBask is composed of two stages: Degradation Recording and Distribution Backtracking. Degradation Recording is designed to obtain the convergence trajectory of teacher models, which records the degradation path from the trained teacher model to the untrained initial student generator. The degradation path implicitly represents the intermediate distributions of teacher models. Then Distribution Backtracking trains a student generator to backtrack the intermediate distributions for approximating the convergence trajectory of teacher models. Extensive experiments show that DisBack achieves faster and better convergence than the existing distillation method and accomplishes comparable generation performance. Notably, DisBack is easy to implement and can be generalized to existing distillation methods to boost performance.

| **[CAPER: Enhancing Career Trajectory Prediction using Temporal Knowledge Graph and Ternary Relationship](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15620v1)** | 2024-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of career trajectory prediction (CTP) aims to predict one's future employer or job position. While several CTP methods have been developed for this problem, we posit that none of these methods (1) jointly considers the mutual ternary dependency between three key units (i.e., user, position, and company) of a career and (2) captures the characteristic shifts of key units in career over time, leading to an inaccurate understanding of the job movement patterns in the labor market. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel solution, named as CAPER, that solves the challenges via sophisticated temporal knowledge graph (TKG) modeling. It enables the utilization of a graph-structured knowledge base with rich expressiveness, effectively preserving the changes in job movement patterns. Furthermore, we devise an extrapolated career reasoning task on TKG for a realistic evaluation. The experiments on a real-world career trajectory dataset demonstrate that CAPER consistently and significantly outperforms four baselines, two recent TKG reasoning methods, and five state-of-the-art CTP methods in predicting one's future companies and positions-i.e., on average, yielding 6.80% and 34.58% more accurate predictions, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometric Artifact Correction for Symmetric Multi-Linear Trajectory CT: Theory, Method, and Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15069v1)** | 2024-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For extending CT field-of-view to perform non-destructive testing, the Symmetric Multi-Linear trajectory Computed Tomography (SMLCT) has been developed as a successful example of non-standard CT scanning modes. However, inevitable geometric errors can cause severe artifacts in the reconstructed images. The existing calibration method for SMLCT is both crude and inefficient. It involves reconstructing hundreds of images by exhaustively substituting each potential error, and then manually identifying the images with the fewest geometric artifacts to estimate the final geometric errors for calibration. In this paper, we comprehensively and efficiently address the challenging geometric artifacts in SMLCT, , and the corresponding works mainly involve theory, method, and generalization. In particular, after identifying sensitive parameters and conducting some theory analysis of geometric artifacts, we summarize several key properties between sensitive geometric parameters and artifact characteristics. Then, we further construct mathematical relationships that relate sensitive geometric errors to the pixel offsets of reconstruction images with artifact characteristics. To accurately extract pixel bias, we innovatively adapt the Generalized Cross-Correlation with Phase Transform (GCC-PHAT) algorithm, commonly used in sound processing, for our image registration task for each paired symmetric LCT. This adaptation leads to the design of a highly efficient rigid translation registration method. Simulation and physical experiments have validated the excellent performance of this work. Additionally, our results demonstrate significant generalization to common rotated CT and a variant of SMLCT.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Probabilistic Visibility-Aware Trajectory Planning for Target Tracking in Cluttered Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06363v2)** | 2024-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Target tracking has numerous significant civilian and military applications, and maintaining the visibility of the target plays a vital role in ensuring the success of the tracking task. Existing visibility-aware planners primarily focus on keeping the target within the limited field of view of an onboard sensor and avoiding obstacle occlusion. However, the negative impact of system uncertainty is often neglected, rendering the planners delicate to uncertainties in practice. To bridge the gap, this work proposes a real-time, non-myopic trajectory planner for visibility-aware and safe target tracking in the presence of system uncertainty. For more accurate target motion prediction, we introduce the concept of belief-space probability of detection (BPOD) to measure the predictive visibility of the target under stochastic robot and target states. An Extended Kalman Filter variant incorporating BPOD is developed to predict target belief state under uncertain visibility within the planning horizon. To reach real-time trajectory planning, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm to uniformly calculate both BPOD and the chance-constrained collision risk by utilizing linearized signed distance function (SDF), and then design a two-stage strategy for lightweight calculation of SDF in sequential convex programming. Extensive simulation results with benchmark comparisons show the capacity of the proposed approach to robustly maintain the visibility of the target under high system uncertainty. The practicality of the proposed trajectory planner is validated by real-world experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>A tec...</summary><p>A technical report for our conference paper in 2024 American Control Conference (ACC)</p></details> |

Nonetheless, the potential of transformer-based diffusion models for effectively generating videos with controllable motion remains an area of limited exploration. This paper introduces Tora, the first trajectory-oriented DiT framework that concurrently integrates textual, visual, and trajectory conditions, thereby enabling scalable video generation with effective motion guidance. Specifically, Tora consists of a Trajectory Extractor(TE), a Spatial-Temporal DiT, and a Motion-guidance Fuser(MGF). The TE encodes arbitrary trajectories into hierarchical spacetime motion patches with a 3D video compression network. The MGF integrates the motion patches into the DiT blocks to generate consistent videos that accurately follow designated trajectories. Our design aligns seamlessly with DiT's scalability, allowing precise control of video content's dynamics with diverse durations, aspect ratios, and resolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate Tora's excellence in achieving high motion fidelity, while also meticulously simulating the intricate movement of the physical world.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Optimization Trajectories Explain Multi-Task Transfer?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14677v1)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the widespread adoption of multi-task training in deep learning, little is understood about how multi-task learning (MTL) affects generalization. Prior work has conjectured that the negative effects of MTL are due to optimization challenges that arise during training, and many optimization methods have been proposed to improve multi-task performance. However, recent work has shown that these methods fail to consistently improve multi-task generalization. In this work, we seek to improve our understanding of these failures by empirically studying how MTL impacts the optimization of tasks, and whether this impact can explain the effects of MTL on generalization. We show that MTL results in a generalization gap-a gap in generalization at comparable training loss-between single-task and multi-task trajectories early into training. However, we find that factors of the optimization trajectory previously proposed to explain generalization gaps in single-task settings cannot explain the generalization gaps between single-task and multi-task models. Moreover, we show that the amount of gradient conflict between tasks is correlated with negative effects to task optimization, but is not predictive of generalization. Our work sheds light on the underlying causes for failures in MTL and, importantly, raises questions about the role of general purpose multi-task optimization algorithms.</p></details> | Pre-print |
| **[Collision-Free Trajectory Optimization in Cluttered Environments Using Sums-of-Squares Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05242v2)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a trajectory optimization approach for robot navigation in cluttered 3D environments. We represent the robot's geometry as a semialgebraic set defined by polynomial inequalities such that robots with general shapes can be suitably characterized. To address the robot navigation task in obstacle-dense environments, we exploit the free space directly to construct a sequence of free regions, and allocate each waypoint on the trajectory to a specific region. Then, we incorporate a uniform scaling factor for each free region, and formulate a Sums-of-Squares (SOS) optimization problem that renders the containment relationship between the robot and the free space computationally tractable. The SOS optimization problem is further reformulated to a semidefinite program (SDP), and the collision-free constraints are shown to be equivalent to limiting the scaling factor along the entire trajectory. In this context, the robot at a specific configuration is tailored to stay within the free region. Next, to solve the trajectory optimization problem with the proposed safety constraints (which are implicitly dependent on the robot configurations), we derive the analytical solution to the gradient of the minimum scaling factor with respect to the robot configuration. As a result, this seamlessly facilitates the use of gradient-based methods in efficient solving of the trajectory optimization problem. Through a series of simulations and real-world experiments, the proposed trajectory optimization approach is validated in various challenging scenarios, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in generating collision-free trajectories in dense and intricate environments populated with obstacles.

However, the development and ranking of state-of-the-art (SotA) models are driven by their In-Distribution (ID) performance on individual competition datasets. We present an OoD testing protocol that homogenizes datasets and prediction tasks across two large-scale motion datasets. We introduce a novel prediction algorithm based on polynomial representations for agent trajectory and road geometry on both the input and output sides of the model. With a much smaller model size, training effort, and inference time, we reach near SotA performance for ID testing and significantly improve robustness in OoD testing. Within our OoD testing protocol, we further study two augmentation strategies of SotA models and their effects on model generalization. Highlighting the contrast between ID and OoD performance, we suggest adding OoD testing to the evaluation criteria of trajectory prediction models.</p></details> |  |

Traditional as well as recent data-driven marginal trajectory prediction methods struggle to properly learn non-linear agent-to-agent interactions. We present SSL-Interactions that proposes pretext tasks to enhance interaction modeling for trajectory prediction. We introduce four interaction-aware pretext tasks to encapsulate various aspects of agent interactions: range gap prediction, closest distance prediction, direction of movement prediction, and type of interaction prediction. We further propose an approach to curate interaction-heavy scenarios from datasets. This curated data has two advantages: it provides a stronger learning signal to the interaction model, and facilitates generation of pseudo-labels for interaction-centric pretext tasks. We also propose three new metrics specifically designed to evaluate predictions in interactive scenes. Our empirical evaluations indicate SSL-Interactions outperforms state-of-the-art motion forecasting methods quantitatively with up to 8% improvement, and qualitatively, for interaction-heavy scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IV-2024. 13 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

However, generating factually consistent responses in knowledge-intensive scenarios remains a challenge due to issues such as hallucination, difficulty in acquiring long-tailed knowledge, and limited memory expansion. This paper introduces SMART, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages external knowledge to enhance the interpretability and factual consistency of LLM-generated responses. SMART comprises four specialized agents, each performing a specific sub-trajectory action to navigate complex knowledge-intensive tasks. We propose a multi-agent co-training paradigm, Long-Short Trajectory Learning, which ensures synergistic collaboration among agents while maintaining fine-grained execution by each agent. Extensive experiments on five knowledge-intensive tasks demonstrate SMART's superior performance compared to widely adopted knowledge internalization and knowledge enhancement methods. Our framework can extend beyond knowledge-intensive tasks to more complex scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/yueshengbin/SMART.</p></details> |  |

Assuming that the vehicle follows a trajectory that can be uniquely identified by the sequence of control inputs and by some intermittent ranging measurements from known points in the environment, we can model the trajectory as a rigid body subject to rotation and translation in the plane. This way, the localisation problem can be reduced to finding the conditions for the existence of a unique roto-translation of the trajectory from a known reference frame to the world reference frame, given the collected measurements. As discussed in this paper, such conditions can be expressed in terms of the shape of the trajectory, of the layout of the ranging sensors, and of the numbers of measurements collected from each of them. The approach applies to a large class of kinematic models. Focusing on the special case of unicycle kinematics, we provide additional local constructibility results.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, This article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control (2024). content may change prior to final publication</p></details> |
| **[Multi-finger Manipulation via Trajectory Optimization with Differentiable Rolling and Geometric Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13229v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameterizing finger rolling and finger-object contacts in a differentiable manner is important for formulating dexterous manipulation as a trajectory optimization problem. In contrast to previous methods which often assume simplified geometries of the robot and object or do not explicitly model finger rolling, we propose a method to further extend the capabilities of dexterous manipulation by accounting for non-trivial geometries of both the robot and the object. By integrating the object's Signed Distance Field (SDF) with a sampling method, our method estimates contact and rolling-related variables and includes those in a trajectory optimization framework. This formulation naturally allows for the emergence of finger-rolling behaviors, enabling the robot to locally adjust the contact points. Our method is tested in a peg alignment task and a screwdriver turning task, where it outperforms the baselines in terms of achieving desired object configurations and avoiding dropping the object. We also successfully apply our method to a real-world screwdriver turning task, demonstrating its robustness to the sim2real gap.</p></details> |  |
| **[A New Perspective to Fish Trajectory Imputation: A Methodology for Spatiotemporal Modeling of Acoustically Tagged Fish Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13220v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The focus of this paper is a key component of a methodology for understanding, interpolating, and predicting fish movement patterns based on spatiotemporal data recorded by spatially static acoustic receivers. For periods of time, fish may be far from the receivers, resulting in the absence of observations. The lack of information on the fish's location for extended time periods poses challenges to the understanding of fish movement patterns, and hence, the identification of proper statistical inference frameworks for modeling the trajectories. As the initial step in our methodology, in this paper, we implement an imputation strategy that relies on both Markov chain and Brownian motion principles to enhance our dataset over time. This methodology will be generalizable and applicable to all fish species with similar migration patterns or data with similar structures due to the use of static acoustic receivers.</p></details> |  |

| **[Differentially Private Spatiotemporal Trajectory Synthesis with Retained Data Utility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12842v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal trajectories collected from GPS-enabled devices are of vital importance to many applications, such as urban planning and traffic analysis. Due to the privacy leakage concerns, many privacy-preserving trajectory publishing methods have been proposed. However, most of them could not strike a good balance between privacy protection and good data utility. In this paper, we propose DP-STTS, a differentially private spatiotemporal trajectory synthesizer with high data utility, which employs a model composed of a start spatiotemporal cube distribution and a 1-order Markov process. Specially, DP-STTS firstly discretizes the raw spatiotemporal trajectories into neighboring cubes, such that the model size is limited and the model's tolerance for noise could be enhanced. Then, a Markov process is utilized for the next location point picking. After adding noise under differential privacy (DP) to the model, synthetic trajectories that preserve essential spatial and temporal characteristics of the real trajectories are generated from the noisy model. Experiments on one real-life dataset demonstrate that DP-STTS provides good data utility. Our code is available at https://github.com/Etherious72/DP-STTS.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Minimizing Movement Delay for Movable Antennas via Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12813v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Movable antennas (MAs) have received increasing attention in wireless communications due to their capability of antenna position adjustment to reconfigure wireless channels. However, moving MAs results in non-negligible delay, which may decrease the effective data transmission time. To reduce the movement delay, we study in this paper a new MA trajectory optimization problem. In particular, given the desired destination positions of multiple MAs, we aim to jointly optimize their associations with the initial MA positions and the trajectories for moving them from their respective initial to destination positions within a given two-dimensional (2D) region, such that the delay of antenna movement is minimized, subject to the inter-MA minimum distance constraints in the movement. However, this problem is a continuous-time mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem that is challenging to solve. To tackle this challenge, we propose a two-stage optimization framework that sequentially optimizes the MAs' position associations and trajectories, respectively. First, we relax the inter-MA distance constraints and optimally solve the resulted delay minimization problem. Next, we check if the obtained MA association and trajectory solutions satisfy the inter-MA distance constraints. If not satisfied, we then employ a successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm to adjust the MAs' trajectories until they satisfy the given constraints. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of our proposed trajectory optimization method in reducing the movement delay as well as draw useful insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages,6 figures, submit to GLOBECOM 2024 Workshop - IRAFWCC</p></details> |
| **[DBHP: Trajectory Imputation in Multi-Agent Sports Using Derivative-Based Hybrid Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10878v2)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many spatiotemporal domains handle multi-agent trajectory data, but in real-world scenarios, collected trajectory data are often partially missing due to various reasons. While existing approaches demonstrate good performance in trajectory imputation, they face challenges in capturing the complex dynamics and interactions between agents due to a lack of physical constraints that govern realistic trajectories, leading to suboptimal results. To address this issue, the paper proposes a Derivative-Based Hybrid Prediction (DBHP) framework that can effectively impute multiple agents' missing trajectories. First, a neural network equipped with Set Transformers produces a naive prediction of missing trajectories while satisfying the permutation-equivariance in terms of the order of input agents. Then, the framework makes alternative predictions leveraging velocity and acceleration information and combines all the predictions with properly determined weights to provide final imputed trajectories. In this way, our proposed framework not only accurately predicts position, velocity, and acceleration values but also enforces the physical relationship between them, eventually improving both the accuracy and naturalness of the predicted trajectories. Accordingly, the experiment results about imputing player trajectories in team sports show that our framework significantly outperforms existing imputation baselines.</p></details> |  |

To be as efficient as human surveyors, robotic systems must continuously collect observational data required to complete their survey task. Inspection personnel instinctively know to look at relevant equipment that happens to be ``along the way.'' In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for continuous long-horizon viewpoint planning, for ground robots, applied to tasks involving patrolling, monitoring or visual data gathering in known environments. Our approach to Long Horizon Viewpoint Planning (LHVP), enables the robot to autonomously navigate and collect environmental data optimizing for coverage over the horizon of the patrol. Leveraging a quadruped's mobility and sensory capabilities, our LHVP framework plans patrol paths that account for coupling the viewpoint planner for the arm camera with the mobile base's navigation planner. The viewpath optimization algorithm seeks a balance between comprehensive environmental coverage and dynamically feasible movements, thus ensuring prolonged and effective operation in scenarios including monitoring, security surveillance, and disaster response. We validate our approach through simulations and in the real world and show that our LHVP significantly outperforms naive patrolling methods in terms of area coverage generating information-gathering trajectories for the robot arm. Our results indicate a promising direction for the deployment of mobile robots in long-term, autonomous surveying, and environmental data collection tasks, highlighting the potential of intelligent robotic systems in challenging real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, configuring the skills' parameters for a specific task remains a manual and time-consuming endeavor. Existing approaches for learning or optimizing these parameters often require numerous real-world executions or do not work in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose MuTT, a novel encoder-decoder transformer architecture designed to predict environment-aware executions of robot skills by integrating vision, trajectory, and robot skill parameters. Notably, we pioneer the fusion of vision and trajectory, introducing a novel trajectory projection. Furthermore, we illustrate MuTT's efficacy as a predictor when combined with a model-based robot skill optimizer. This approach facilitates the optimization of robot skill parameters for the current environment, without the need for real-world executions during optimization. Designed for compatibility with any representation of robot skills, MuTT demonstrates its versatility across three comprehensive experiments, showcasing superior performance across two different skill representations.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this challenge, we propose a progressive 3D editing strategy that ensures multi-view consistency via a Trajectory-Anchored Scheme (TAS) with a dual-branch editing mechanism. Specifically, TAS facilitates a tightly coupled iterative process between 2D view editing and 3D updating, preventing error accumulation yielded from text-to-image process. Additionally, we explore the relationship between optimization-based methods and reconstruction-based methods, offering a unified perspective for selecting superior design choice, supporting the rationale behind the designed TAS. We further present a tuning-free View-Consistent Attention Control (VCAC) module that leverages cross-view semantic and geometric reference from the source branch to yield aligned views from the target branch during the editing of 2D views. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we analyze 2D examples to demonstrate the improved consistency with the VCAC module. Further extensive quantitative and qualitative results in text-guided 3D scene editing indicate that our method achieves superior editing quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Traditional methods often struggle to balance resource conservation, accurate state estimation and precise tracking, resulting in suboptimal performance. This problem is particularly pronounced in environments with large action spaces, where the need for frequent, accurate state data is paramount, yet the capacity for active localization updates is restricted by external limitations. This paper introduces ComTraQ-MPC, a novel framework that combines Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) to optimize trajectory tracking with constrained active localization updates. The meta-trained DQN ensures adaptive active localization scheduling, while the MPC leverages available state information to improve tracking. The central contribution of this work is their reciprocal interaction: DQN's update decisions inform MPC's control strategy, and MPC's outcomes refine DQN's learning, creating a cohesive, adaptive system. Empirical evaluations in simulated and real-world settings demonstrate that ComTraQ-MPC significantly enhances operational efficiency and accuracy, providing a generalizable and approximately optimal solution for trajectory tracking in complex partially observable environments.</p></details> | * Equal contribution |

Understanding the importance of risk factors measured at a mental health visit can help clinicians evaluate future risk and provide appropriate care during the visit. In prediction settings where data are collected over time, such as in mental health care, it is often of interest to understand both the importance of variables for predicting the response at each time point and the importance summarized over the time series. Building on recent advances in estimation and inference for variable importance measures, we define summaries of variable importance trajectories and corresponding estimators. The same approaches for inference can be applied to these measures regardless of the choice of the algorithm(s) used to estimate the prediction function. We propose a nonparametric efficient estimation and inference procedure as well as a null hypothesis testing procedure that are valid even when complex machine learning tools are used for prediction. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed procedures have good operating characteristics. We use these approaches to analyze electronic health records data from two large health systems to investigate the longitudinal importance of risk factors for suicide attempt to inform future suicide prevention research and clinical workflow.</p></details> | <details><summary>81 pa...</summary><p>81 pages (34 main, 47 supplementary), 8 figures (4 main, 4 supplementary), 29 tables (2 main, 27 supplementary)</p></details> |

A common approach to address motion planning problems is trajectory optimization. Trajectory optimization can represent the high-level behaviors of robots through mathematical formulations. However, current trajectory optimization approaches have two main challenges. Firstly, their solution heavily depends on the initial guess, and they are prone to get stuck in local minima. Secondly, they face scalability limitations by increasing the number of constraints. This thesis endeavors to tackle these challenges by introducing four innovative trajectory optimization algorithms to improve reliability, scalability, and computational efficiency. There are two novel aspects of the proposed algorithms. The first key innovation is remodeling the kinematic constraints and collision avoidance constraints. Another key innovation lies in the design of algorithms that effectively utilize parallel computation on GPU accelerators. By using reformulated constraints and leveraging the computational power of GPUs, the proposed algorithms of this thesis demonstrate significant improvements in efficiency and scalability compared to the existing methods. Parallelization enables faster computation times, allowing for real-time decision-making in dynamic environments. Moreover, the algorithms are designed to adapt to changes in the environment, ensuring robust performance. Extensive benchmarking for each proposed optimizer validates their efficacy. Overall, this thesis makes a significant contribution to the field of trajectory optimization algorithms. It introduces innovative solutions that specifically address the challenges faced by existing methods. The proposed algorithms pave the way for more efficient and robust motion planning solutions in robotics by leveraging parallel computation and specific mathematical structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD T...</summary><p>PhD Thesis, University of Tartu, 2024.

However, imaging organs with large tissue movements, such as those caused by respiration, presents substantial challenges. Existing methods often require breath holding to maintain accumulation accuracy, which limits data acquisition time and ULM image saturation. To improve image quality in the presence of large tissue movements, this study introduces an approach integrating high-frame-rate ultrasound with online precise robotic probe control. Tested on a microvasculature phantom with translation motions up to 20 mm, twice the aperture size of the matrix array used, our method achieved real-time tracking of the moving phantom and imaging volume rate at 85 Hz, keeping majority of the target volume in the imaging field of view. ULM images of the moving cross channels in the phantom were successfully reconstructed in post-processing, demonstrating the feasibility of super-resolution imaging under large tissue motions. This represents a significant step towards ULM imaging of organs with large motion.</p></details> |  |

As an application, we explore some consequences of our results for the phenomenon of dimension-free concentration of measure for Bures-Wasserstein barycenters. Our theory reveals a novel notion of exponential tilting in the Bures-Wasserstein space, which, in analogy with Cr\'amer's theorem in the Euclidean case, solves the relative entropy projection problem under a constraint on the barycenter. Notably, this method of proof is easy to adapt to other geometric settings of interest; with the same method, we obtain large deviations principles for empirical barycenters in Riemannian manifolds and the univariate Wasserstein space, and we obtain large deviations upper bounds for empirical barycenters in the general multivariate Wasserstein space. In fact, our results are the first known large deviations principles for Fr\'echet means in any non-linear metric space.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 2 figures.

| **[Dated Data: Tracing Knowledge Cutoffs in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12958v2)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Released Large Language Models (LLMs) are often paired with a claimed knowledge cutoff date, or the dates at which training data was gathered. Such information is crucial for applications where the LLM must provide up to date information. However, this statement only scratches the surface: do all resources in the training data share the same knowledge cutoff date? Does the model's demonstrated knowledge for these subsets closely align to their cutoff dates? In this work, we define the notion of an effective cutoff. This is distinct from the LLM designer reported cutoff and applies separately to sub-resources and topics. We propose a simple approach to estimate effective cutoffs on the resource-level temporal alignment of an LLM by probing across versions of the data. Using this analysis, we find that effective cutoffs often differ from reported cutoffs. To understand the root cause of this observation, we conduct a direct large-scale analysis on open pre-training datasets. Our analysis reveals two reasons for these inconsistencies: (1) temporal biases of CommonCrawl data due to non-trivial amounts of old data in new dumps and (2) complications in LLM deduplication schemes involving semantic duplicates and lexical near-duplicates. Overall, our results show that knowledge cutoffs are not as simple as they have seemed and that care must be taken both by LLM dataset curators as well as practitioners who seek to use information from these models.</p></details> |  |

Those MLLMs are typically built based on the LLMs, with an image encoder to process images into the token embedding space of the LLMs. However, the integration of visual modality has introduced a unique vulnerability: the MLLM becomes susceptible to malicious visual inputs and prone to generating sensitive or harmful responses, even though the LLM has been trained on textual dataset to align with human value. In this paper, we first raise the question: ``Do the MLLMs possess safety-awareness against malicious image inputs?". We find that after adding a principle that specifies the safety requirement into the input of the MLLM, the model's safety awareness becomes boosted. This phenomenon verifies the existence of MLLM's safety-awareness against image inputs, it is only weakened by the modality gap. We then introduce a simple yet effective technique termed CoCA, which amplifies the safety-awareness of the MLLM by calibrating its output distribution. Our proposed strategy helps the model reclaim its original safety awareness without losing its original capabilities. We verify the effectiveness of our approach on both multimodal safety and understanding benchmarks.</p></details> | 10 pages, COLM-2024 |

Existing detection and mitigation methods are often isolated and insufficient for domain-specific needs, lacking a standardized pipeline. This paper introduces THaMES (Tool for Hallucination Mitigations and EvaluationS), an integrated framework and library addressing this gap. THaMES offers an end-to-end solution for evaluating and mitigating hallucinations in LLMs, featuring automated test set generation, multifaceted benchmarking, and adaptable mitigation strategies. It automates test set creation from any corpus, ensuring high data quality, diversity, and cost-efficiency through techniques like batch processing, weighted sampling, and counterfactual validation. THaMES assesses a model's ability to detect and reduce hallucinations across various tasks, including text generation and binary classification, applying optimal mitigation strategies like In-Context Learning (ICL), Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT). Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs using a knowledge base of academic papers, political news, and Wikipedia reveal that commercial models like GPT-4o benefit more from RAG than ICL, while open-weight models like Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Mistral-Nemo gain more from ICL. Additionally, PEFT significantly enhances the performance of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct in both evaluation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to NeurIPS 2024 SoLaR (Socially Responsible Language Modelling Research ) Workshop</p></details> |

Existing LLM-based multi-agent models have successfully addressed basic dialogue tasks. However, the potential of LLMs for more challenging tasks, such as automated code generation for large and complex projects, has been investigated in only a few existing works. Objective: This paper aims to investigate the potential of LLM-based agents in the software industry, particularly in enhancing productivity and reducing time-to-market for complex software solutions. Our primary objective is to gain insights into how these agents can fundamentally transform the development of large-scale software. Methods: We introduce CodePori, a novel system designed to automate code generation for large and complex software projects based on functional and non-functional requirements defined by stakeholders. To assess the proposed system performance, we utilized the HumanEval benchmark and manually tested the CodePori model, providing 20 different project descriptions as input and then evaluated the code accuracy by manually executing the code. Results: CodePori is able to generate running code for large-scale projects, aligned with the typical software development process. The HumanEval benchmark results indicate that CodePori improves code accuracy by 89%. A manual assessment conducted by the first author shows that the CodePori system achieved an accuracy rate of 85%. Conclusion: Based on the results, our conclusion is that proposed system demonstrates the transformative potential of LLM-based agents in SE, highlighting their practical applications and opening new opportunities for broader adoption in both industry and academia.

Our architectural and implementation choices address the challenge of harnessing linguistic diversity while maintaining efficiency and avoiding the common pitfalls of multilinguality. Our analysis of the evaluation results shows competitive performance in natural language generation and understanding tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate how the learned expert-routing mechanism exploits implicit phylogenetic linguistic patterns to potentially alleviate the curse of multilinguality. We provide an in-depth look at the training process, an analysis of the datasets, and a balanced exploration of the model's strengths and limitations. As an open-source model, LOLA promotes reproducibility and serves as a robust foundation for future research. Our findings enable the development of compute-efficient multilingual models with strong, scalable performance across languages.</p></details> |  |

Reflective prompts have been used to provide direction, and large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the potential to provide tailored guidance. Current systems often limit users' flexibility to direct their reflections. We thus present ExploreSelf, an LLM-driven application designed to empower users to control their reflective journey. ExploreSelf allows users to receive adaptive support through dynamically generated questions. Through an exploratory study with 19 participants, we examine how participants explore and reflect on personal challenges using ExploreSelf. Our findings demonstrate that participants valued the balance between guided support and freedom to control their reflective journey, leading to deeper engagement and insight. Building on our findings, we discuss implications for designing LLM-driven tools that promote user empowerment through effective reflective practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages excluding reference and appendix</p></details> |

This study evaluates the impact of popular compression methods - Magnitude Pruning, SparseGPT, and Wanda - on the LLaMA-2-7B model, focusing on the trade-offs between model size reduction, downstream task performance, and the role of calibration data. Our findings reveal that while SparseGPT and Wanda preserve perplexity even at 50% sparsity, they suffer significant degradation on downstream tasks, highlighting the inadequacy of perplexity as the sole evaluation metric. To address this, we introduce Jensen-Shannon (JS) Divergence as a more comprehensive metric that captures nuanced changes in model behavior post-compression. We further demonstrate that task-specific calibration data significantly enhances the downstream performance of compressed models compared to general calibration data. This research underscores the necessity for diverse evaluation metrics and careful calibration data selection to fully understand the complexities of LLM compression and its implications for practical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Evolutionary Large Language Models through Uncertainty-Enhanced Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11212v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Iterative preference optimization has recently become one of the de-facto training paradigms for large language models (LLMs), but the performance is still underwhelming due to too much noisy preference data yielded in the loop. To combat this issue, we present an \textbf{U}ncertainty-enhanced \textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization (UPO) framework to make the LLM self-evolve with reliable feedback. The key idea is mitigating the noisy preference data derived from the current policy and reward models by performing pair-wise uncertainty estimation and judiciously reliable feedback sampling. To reach this goal, we thus introduce an estimator model, which incorporates Monte Carlo (MC) dropout in Bayesian neural network (BNN) to perform uncertainty estimation for the preference data derived from the LLM policy. Compared to the existing methods that directly filter generated responses based on the reward score, the estimator focuses on the model uncertainty in a pair-wise manner and effectively bypasses the confirmation bias problem of the reward model. Additionally, we also propose an uncertainty-enhanced self-evolution algorithm to improve the robustness of preference optimization and encourage the LLM to generate responses with both high reward and certainty. Extensive experiments over multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our framework substantially alleviates the noisy problem and improves the performance of iterative preference optimization.</p></details> | 17 pages |

The proposed algorithm addresses the computational challenges of V-graph construction and shortest path search on the graph simultaneously. By introducing hierarchical 3D V-graph construction with heuristic visibility update, the 3D V-graph is constructed in O(K*n^2logn) time, which guarantees real-time performance. The proposed iterative divide-and-conquer path search method can achieve near-optimal path solutions within the constraints of real-time operations. The algorithm ensures efficient 3D V-graph construction and path search. Extensive simulated and real-world environments validated that our algorithm reduces the travel time by 42%, achieves up to 24.8% higher trajectory efficiency, and runs faster than most benchmarks by orders of magnitude in complex environments. The code and developed simulator have been open-sourced to facilitate future research.</p></details> |  |

This work presents three new benchmarks: Invalsi MATE to evaluate models performance on mathematical understanding in Italian, Invalsi ITA to evaluate language understanding in Italian and Olimpiadi MATE for more complex mathematical understanding. The first two benchmarks are based on the Invalsi tests, which are administered to students of age between 6 and 18 within the Italian school system and have been validated by several experts in teaching and pedagogy, the third one comes from the Italian high school math Olympics. We evaluate 10 powerful language models on these benchmarks and find that they are bound by 71% accuracy on Invasli MATE, achieved by Llama 3.1 70b instruct and by 88% on Invalsi ITA. For both Invalsi MATE and Invalsi ITA we compare LLMs with the average performance of Italian students to show that Llama 3.1 is the only one to outperform them on Invalsi MATE while most models do so on Invalsi ITA, we then show that Olimpiadi MATE is more challenging than Invalsi MATE and the highest accuracy, achieved by Llama 3.1 405b instruct is 45%. We will make data and evaluation code openly available upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a learning-based framework named ULOC for Ultra-Wideband (UWB) based localization in such complex large-scale environments. First, anchors are deployed in the environment without knowledge of their actual position. Then, UWB observations are collected when the vehicle travels in the environment. At the same time, map-consistent pose estimates are developed from registering (onboard self-localization) data with the prior map to provide the training labels. We then propose a network based on MAMBA that learns the ranging patterns of UWBs over a complex large-scale environment. The experiment demonstrates that our solution can ensure high localization accuracy on a large scale compared to the state-of-the-art. We release our source code to benefit the community at https://github.com/brytsknguyen/uloc.</p></details> |  |

With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), their language capabilities are becoming increasingly comparable to those of humans. But do LLMs have memory? Based on current performance, LLMs do appear to exhibit memory. So, what is the underlying mechanism of this memory? Previous research has lacked a deep exploration of LLMs' memory capabilities and the underlying theory. In this paper, we use Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT) to explain the memory mechanism in LLMs. We also conduct experiments to verify the memory capabilities of various LLMs, proposing a new method to assess their abilities based on these memory ability. We argue that LLM memory operates like Schr\"odinger's memory, meaning that it only becomes observable when a specific memory is queried. We can only determine if the model retains a memory based on its output in response to the query; otherwise, it remains indeterminate. Finally, we expand on this concept by comparing the memory capabilities of the human brain and LLMs, highlighting the similarities and differences in their operational mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

However, much of this research has concentrated on instance-level unlearning, specifically targeting the removal of predefined instances containing sensitive content. This focus has left a significant gap in the exploration of full entity-level unlearning, which is critical in real-world scenarios such as copyright protection. To this end, we propose a novel task of Entity-level unlearning, which aims to erase entity-related knowledge from the target model completely. To thoroughly investigate this task, we systematically evaluate trending unlearning algorithms, revealing that current methods struggle to achieve effective entity-level unlearning. Then, we further explore the factors that influence the performance of the unlearning algorithms, identifying that knowledge coverage and the size of the forget set play pivotal roles. Notably, our analysis also uncovers that entities introduced through fine-tuning are more vulnerable to unlearning than pre-trained entities. These findings collectively offer valuable insights for advancing entity-level unlearning for LLMs.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Instead, human evaluations that expand on traditional qualitative techniques from natural language generation literature are required. One recent best-practice consists in using A/B-testing frameworks, which capture preferences of human evaluators for specific models. In this paper we describe a human evaluation experiment focused on the biomedical domain (health, biology, chemistry/pharmacology) carried out at Elsevier. In it a large but not massive (8.8B parameter) decoder-only foundational transformer trained on a relatively small (135B tokens) but highly curated collection of Elsevier datasets is compared to OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo and Meta's foundational 7B parameter Llama 2 model against multiple criteria. Results indicate -- even if IRR scores were generally low -- a preference towards GPT-3.5-turbo, and hence towards models that possess conversational abilities, are very large and were trained on very large datasets. But at the same time, indicate that for less massive models training on smaller but well-curated training sets can potentially give rise to viable alternatives in the biomedical domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This document was submitted without obtaining all necessary permissions and therefore needs to be withdrawn.

We used the US and South Korea as the cultural pair, given that prior research suggests substantial personality differences between people from these two countries. We manipulated the target of the simulation (US vs. Korean), the language of the inventory (English vs. Korean), and the language model (GPT-4 vs. GPT-3.5). Our results show that GPT-4 replicated the cross-cultural differences for each factor. However, mean ratings had an upward bias and exhibited lower variation than in the human samples, as well as lower structural validity. We provide preliminary evidence that LLMs can aid cross-cultural researchers and practitioners.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages: 12 pages of manuscript + 15 pages of supplementary materials</p></details> |

While depth pruning accelerates inference, it requires extensive recovery training, which can take up to two weeks. On the other hand, width pruning retains much of the performance but offers slight speed gains. To tackle these challenges, we propose KVPruner to improve model efficiency while maintaining performance. Our method uses global perplexity-based analysis to determine the importance ratio for each block and provides multiple strategies to prune non-essential KV channels within blocks. Compared to the original model, KVPruner reduces runtime memory usage by 50% and boosts throughput by over 35%. Additionally, our method requires only two hours of LoRA fine-tuning on small datasets to recover most of the performance.</p></details> |  |

Due to the inherent ambiguity of natural language and the complexity of rule sets, especially in long contexts, LLMs often struggle to follow all specified rules, frequently omitting at least one. To enhance the reasoning and understanding of LLMs on long and complex contexts, we propose a novel prompting strategy Multi-Lingual Prompt, namely MLPrompt, which automatically translates the error-prone rule that an LLM struggles to follow into another language, thus drawing greater attention to it. Experimental results on public datasets across various tasks have shown MLPrompt can outperform state-of-the-art prompting methods such as Chain of Thought, Tree of Thought, and Self-Consistency. Additionally, we introduce a framework integrating MLPrompt with an auto-checking mechanism for structured data generation, with a specific case study in text-to-MIP instances. Further, we extend the proposed framework for text-to-SQL to demonstrate its generation ability towards structured data synthesis.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, recent large-scale models such as Llama 3.1 with up to 405B have not been thoroughly examined. This paper evaluates the performance of instruction-tuned LLMs across various quantization methods (GPTQ, AWQ, SmoothQuant, and FP8) on models ranging from 7B to 405B. Using 13 benchmarks, we assess performance across six task types: commonsense Q\&A, knowledge and language understanding, instruction following, hallucination detection, mathematics, and dialogue. Our key findings reveal that (1) quantizing a larger LLM to a similar size as a smaller FP16 LLM generally performs better across most benchmarks, except for hallucination detection and instruction following; (2) performance varies significantly with different quantization methods, model size, and bit-width, with weight-only methods often yielding better results in larger models; (3) task difficulty does not significantly impact accuracy degradation due to quantization; and (4) the MT-Bench evaluation method has limited discriminatory power among recent high-performing LLMs.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |

It focuses on examining and analyzing time-based digital artefacts, such as timestamps derived from event logs, file metadata, and other relevant data, to correlate events linked to cyber incidents and reconstruct their chronological sequence. Traditional tools often struggle to efficiently handle the large volume and variety of data generated during DF investigations and Incident Response (IR) processes. This paper introduces a novel framework, GenDFIR, which combines Rule-Based Artificial Intelligence (R-BAI) algorithms with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance and automate the TA process. The proposed approach consists of two key stages: (1) R-BAI is used to identify and select anomalous digital artefacts based on predefined rules. (2) The selected artefacts are then transformed into embeddings for processing by an LLM with the assistance of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent. The LLM uses its capabilities to perform automated TA on the artefacts and predict potential incident outcomes. To validate the framework, we evaluated its performance, efficiency, and reliability. Several metrics were applied to simulated cyber incident scenarios, which were presented as forensic case documents. Our findings demonstrate the significant potential of integrating R-BAI and LLMs for TA. This innovative approach underscores the power of Generative AI (GenAI), particularly LLMs, and opens up new possibilities for advanced threat detection and incident reconstruction, marking a significant advancement in the field.</p></details> | 23 pages |

To address these limitations, we explore using Large Language Models (LLMs), and in particular, their abilities of doing in-context learning, for conversational code generation. As a first step, we define RATS, the ``Repetitive Assembly Task'', a 2D building task designed to lay the foundation for simulating industry assembly scenarios. In this task, a `programmer' instructs a cobot, using natural language, on how a certain assembly is to be built; that is, the programmer induces a program, through natural language. We create a dataset that pairs target structures with various example instructions (human-authored, template-based, and model-generated) and example code. With this, we systematically evaluate the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs for synthesising this kind of code, given in-context examples. Evaluating in a simulated environment, we find that LLMs are capable of generating accurate `first order code' (instruction sequences), but have problems producing `higher-order code' (abstractions such as functions, or use of loops).</p></details> |  |

We hypothesize that even when the model cannot generalize across languages effectively in fine-tuning, it still captures cross-lingual correspondence useful for cross-lingual transfer. We explore this hypothesis with Self-Translate-Train, a method that lets large language models (LLMs) to translate training data into the target language and fine-tunes the model on its own generated data. By demonstrating that Self-Translate-Train outperforms zero-shot transfer, we encourage further exploration of better methods to elicit cross-lingual capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Obfuscation for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11026v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>System prompts that include detailed instructions to describe the task performed by the underlying large language model (LLM) can easily transform foundation models into tools and services with minimal overhead. Because of their crucial impact on the utility, they are often considered intellectual property, similar to the code of a software product. However, extracting system prompts is easily possible by using prompt injection. As of today, there is no effective countermeasure to prevent the stealing of system prompts and all safeguarding efforts could be evaded with carefully crafted prompt injections that bypass all protection mechanisms.In this work, we propose an alternative to conventional system prompts. We introduce prompt obfuscation to prevent the extraction of the system prompt while maintaining the utility of the system itself with only little overhead. The core idea is to find a representation of the original system prompt that leads to the same functionality, while the obfuscated system prompt does not contain any information that allows conclusions to be drawn about the original system prompt. We implement an optimization-based method to find an obfuscated prompt representation while maintaining the functionality. To evaluate our approach, we investigate eight different metrics to compare the performance of a system using the original and the obfuscated system prompts, and we show that the obfuscated version is constantly on par with the original one. We further perform three different deobfuscation attacks and show that with access to the obfuscated prompt and the LLM itself, we are not able to consistently extract meaningful information. Overall, we showed that prompt obfuscation can be an effective method to protect intellectual property while maintaining the same utility as the original system prompt.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, in Named Entity Recognition (NER), existing LLM-based methods underperform compared to baselines and require significantly more computational resources, limiting their application. In this paper, we introduce the task of generation-based extraction and in-context classification (GEIC), designed to leverage LLMs' prior knowledge and self-attention mechanisms for NER tasks. We then propose CascadeNER, a universal and multilingual GEIC framework for few-shot and zero-shot NER. CascadeNER employs model cascading to utilize two small-parameter LLMs to extract and classify independently, reducing resource consumption while enhancing accuracy. We also introduce AnythingNER, the first NER dataset specifically designed for LLMs, including 8 languages, 155 entity types and a novel dynamic categorization system. Experiments show that CascadeNER achieves state-of-the-art performance on low-resource and fine-grained scenarios, including CrossNER and FewNERD. Our work is openly accessible.</p></details> |  |

To explore new capabilities in language modeling for speech processing, we introduce the generative speech transcription error correction (GenSEC) challenge. This challenge comprises three post-ASR language modeling tasks: (i) post-ASR transcription correction, (ii) speaker tagging, and (iii) emotion recognition. These tasks aim to emulate future LLM-based agents handling voice-based interfaces while remaining accessible to a broad audience by utilizing open pretrained language models or agent-based APIs. We also discuss insights from baseline evaluations, as well as lessons learned for designing future evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE SLT 2024.

However, how context-faithful LLMs are and what factors influence LLMs' context-faithfulness remain largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the impact of memory strength and evidence presentation on LLMs' receptiveness to external evidence. We introduce a method to quantify the memory strength of LLMs by measuring the divergence in LLMs' responses to different paraphrases of the same question, which is not considered by previous works. We also generate evidence in various styles to evaluate the effects of evidence in different styles. Two datasets are used for evaluation: Natural Questions (NQ) with popular questions and popQA featuring long-tail questions. Our results show that for questions with high memory strength, LLMs are more likely to rely on internal memory, particularly for larger LLMs such as GPT-4. On the other hand, presenting paraphrased evidence significantly increases LLMs' receptiveness compared to simple repetition or adding details.</p></details> |  |

This article proposes a bio-mimetic multi-robot framework, \textit{Frontier Shepherding (FroShe)}, for large-scale exploration. The presented bio-inspired framework heuristically models frontier exploration similar to the shepherding behavior of herding dogs. This is achieved by modeling frontiers as a sheep swarm reacting to robots modeled as shepherding dogs. The framework is robust across varying environment sizes and obstacle densities and can be easily deployed across multiple agents. Simulation results showcase that the proposed method consistently performed irrespective of the simulated environment's varying sizes and obstacle densities. With the increase in the number of agents, the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art exploration methods, with an average improvement of $20\%$ with the next-best approach(for $3$ UAVs). The proposed technique was implemented and tested in a single and dual drone scenario in a real-world forest-like environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 page article submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)</p></details> |

From our review of 50 representative studies, we demonstrate that a goal-oriented prompt formulation, which guides LLMs to follow established human logical thinking, significantly improves the performance of LLMs. Furthermore, We introduce a novel taxonomy that categorizes goal-oriented prompting methods into five interconnected stages and we demonstrate the broad applicability of our framework.

To address these, researchers released the Build Your Own expert Bot (BYOeB) platform, enabling developers to create LLM-powered chatbots with integrated expert verification. CataractBot, its first implementation, provides expert-verified responses to cataract surgery questions. A pilot evaluation showed its potential; however the study had a small sample size and was primarily qualitative. In this work, we conducted a large-scale 24-week deployment of CataractBot involving 318 patients and attendants who sent 1,992 messages, with 91.71% of responses verified by seven experts. Analysis of interaction logs revealed that medical questions significantly outnumbered logistical ones, hallucinations were negligible, and experts rated 84.52% of medical answers as accurate. As the knowledge base expanded with expert corrections, system performance improved by 19.02%, reducing expert workload. These insights guide the design of future LLM-powered chatbots.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally to this research</p></details> |

However, it also leads to significant complexity for network management due to the large number of elements and dedicated phase-shift optimization. In this work, we provide an overview of machine learning (ML)-enabled optimization for RIS-aided 6G networks. In particular, we focus on various reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, e.g., deep Q-learning, multi-agent reinforcement learning, transfer reinforcement learning, hierarchical reinforcement learning, and offline reinforcement learning. Different from existing studies, this work further discusses how large language models (LLMs) can be combined with RL to handle network optimization problems. It shows that LLM offers new opportunities to enhance the capabilities of RL algorithms in terms of generalization, reward function design, multi-modal information processing, etc. Finally, we identify the future challenges and directions of ML-enabled optimization for RIS-aided 6G networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[PDMX: A Large-Scale Public Domain MusicXML Dataset for Symbolic Music Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10831v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent explosion of generative AI-Music systems has raised numerous concerns over data copyright, licensing music from musicians, and the conflict between open-source AI and large prestige companies. Such issues highlight the need for publicly available, copyright-free musical data, in which there is a large shortage, particularly for symbolic music data. To alleviate this issue, we present PDMX: a large-scale open-source dataset of over 250K public domain MusicXML scores collected from the score-sharing forum MuseScore, making it the largest available copyright-free symbolic music dataset to our knowledge. PDMX additionally includes a wealth of both tag and user interaction metadata, allowing us to efficiently analyze the dataset and filter for high quality user-generated scores. Given the additional metadata afforded by our data collection process, we conduct multitrack music generation experiments evaluating how different representative subsets of PDMX lead to different behaviors in downstream models, and how user-rating statistics can be used as an effective measure of data quality.

| **[Exploring Concept Depth: How Large Language Models Acquire Knowledge at Different Layers?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07066v4)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performances across a wide range of tasks. However, the mechanisms by which these models encode tasks of varying complexities remain poorly understood. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that LLMs process concepts of varying complexities in different layers, introducing the idea of ``Concept Depth'' to suggest that more complex concepts are typically acquired in deeper layers. Specifically, we categorize concepts based on their level of abstraction, defining them in the order of increasing complexity within factual, emotional, and inferential tasks. We conduct extensive probing experiments using layer-wise representations across various LLM families (Gemma, LLaMA, Qwen) on various datasets spanning the three domains of tasks. Our findings reveal that models could efficiently conduct probing for simpler tasks in shallow layers, and more complex tasks typically necessitate deeper layers for accurate understanding. Additionally, we examine how external factors, such as adding noise to the input and quantizing the model weights, might affect layer-wise representations. Our findings suggest that these factors can impede the development of a conceptual understanding of LLMs until deeper layers are explored. We hope that our proposed concept and experimental insights will enhance the understanding of the mechanisms underlying LLMs. Our codes are available at \url{https://github.com/Luckfort/CD}.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Semantics Preserving Emoji Recommendation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10760v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emojis have become an integral part of digital communication, enriching text by conveying emotions, tone, and intent. Existing emoji recommendation methods are primarily evaluated based on their ability to match the exact emoji a user chooses in the original text. However, they ignore the essence of users' behavior on social media in that each text can correspond to multiple reasonable emojis. To better assess a model's ability to align with such real-world emoji usage, we propose a new semantics preserving evaluation framework for emoji recommendation, which measures a model's ability to recommend emojis that maintain the semantic consistency with the user's text. To evaluate how well a model preserves semantics, we assess whether the predicted affective state, demographic profile, and attitudinal stance of the user remain unchanged. If these attributes are preserved, we consider the recommended emojis to have maintained the original semantics. The advanced abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in understanding and generating nuanced, contextually relevant output make them well-suited for handling the complexities of semantics preserving emoji recommendation. To this end, we construct a comprehensive benchmark to systematically assess the performance of six proprietary and open-source LLMs using different prompting techniques on our task. Our experiments demonstrate that GPT-4o outperforms other LLMs, achieving a semantics preservation score of 79.23%. Additionally, we conduct case studies to analyze model biases in downstream classification tasks and evaluate the diversity of the recommended emojis.</p></details> |  |

To further research in this area, establishing a benchmark is essential for evaluating the strengths and limitations of LLMs in these tasks. Despite their capabilities, questions remain regarding whether LLMs can accurately analyze complex vulnerabilities and generate appropriate patches. This paper introduces VulnLLMEval, a framework designed to assess the performance of LLMs in identifying and patching vulnerabilities in C code. Our study includes 307 real-world vulnerabilities extracted from the Linux kernel, creating a well-curated dataset that includes both vulnerable and patched code. This dataset, based on real-world code, provides a diverse and representative testbed for evaluating LLM performance in SVD and SVP tasks, offering a robust foundation for rigorous assessment. Our results reveal that LLMs often struggle with distinguishing between vulnerable and patched code. Furthermore, in SVP tasks, these models tend to oversimplify the code, producing solutions that may not be directly usable without further refinement.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional text-to-image generative models that rely on pre-trained language models like T5 or CLIP text encoders, our approach fully integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with a novel structure that leverages text conditions exclusively from a decoder-only LLM. Additionally, to enhance image captioning quality-we developed an in-house captioner, capable of generating captions with varying levels of detail, enriching the diversity of text structures. We also introduce a new benchmark CapsBench to evaluate detailed image captioning performance. Experimental results demonstrate that PGv3 excels in text prompt adherence, complex reasoning, and accurate text rendering. User preference studies indicate the super-human graphic design ability of our model for common design applications, such as stickers, posters, and logo designs. Furthermore, PGv3 introduces new capabilities, including precise RGB color control and robust multilingual understanding.</p></details> |  |

LLMs typically require continual instruction tuning (CIT) and continual pre-training (CPT) to adapt to new tasks and acquire essential knowledge. However, collecting sufficient CPT data while addressing knowledge gaps remains challenging, as does optimizing the efficiency of utilizing this data. Inspired by the 'summarizing mistakes' strategy, we propose the Continue Evolving from Mistakes (CEM) method, a data-efficient approach aiming to collect CPT data and continually improve LLMs' performance through iterative evaluation and supplementation with mistake-relevant knowledge. To enhance data utilization and mitigate forgetting, we introduce a novel training paradigm that combines CIT and CPT data. Experiments demonstrate that CEM significantly enhances model performance and continual evolution. The code and dataset are available in the GitHub.</p></details> |  |

While large language models (LLMs) show promise for automating this translation by generating more natural and safer code than rule-based methods, previous studies have shown that LLM-generated Rust code often fails to compile, even for relatively small C programs, due to significant differences between the two languages and context window limitations. We propose an LLM-based translation scheme that improves the success rate of translating large-scale C code into compilable Rust code. Our approach involves three key techniques: (1) pre-processing the C code to better align its structure and expressions with Rust, (2) segmenting the code into optimally sized translation units to avoid exceeding the LLM's context window limits, and (3) iteratively compiling and repairing errors while maintaining consistency between translation units using context-supplementing prompts. Compilation success is an essential first step in achieving functional equivalence, as only compilable code can be further tested. In experiments with 20 benchmark C programs, including those exceeding 4 kilo lines of code, we successfully translated all programs into compilable Rust code without losing corresponding parts of the original code.</p></details> |  |

Understanding model vulnerabilities in high-stakes and knowledge-intensive tasks is essential for quantifying the trustworthiness of model predictions and regulating their use. The recent discovery of named entities as adversarial examples (i.e. adversarial entities) in natural language processing tasks raises questions about their potential impact on the knowledge robustness of pre-trained and finetuned LLMs in high-stakes and specialized domains. We examined the use of type-consistent entity substitution as a template for collecting adversarial entities for billion-parameter LLMs with biomedical knowledge. To this end, we developed an embedding-space attack based on powerscaled distance-weighted sampling to assess the robustness of their biomedical knowledge with a low query budget and controllable coverage. Our method has favorable query efficiency and scaling over alternative approaches based on random sampling and blackbox gradient-guided search, which we demonstrated for adversarial distractor generation in biomedical question answering. Subsequent failure mode analysis uncovered two regimes of adversarial entities on the attack surface with distinct characteristics and we showed that entity substitution attacks can manipulate token-wise Shapley value explanations, which become deceptive in this setting. Our approach complements standard evaluations for high-capacity models and the results highlight the brittleness of domain knowledge in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages incl. appendix, updated version</p></details> |

Through a comparative analysis, we assess the performance of emerging LLMs, specifically Llama, CodeLlama, Gemma, and CodeGemma, alongside established state-of-the-art models such as BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-3. Our study aims to shed light on the capabilities of LLMs in vulnerability detection, contributing to the enhancement of software security practices across diverse open-source repositories. We observe that CodeGemma achieves the highest F1-score of 58\ and a Recall of 87\, amongst the recent additions of large language models to detect software security vulnerabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Core-Elements for Large-Scale Least Squares Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10240v4)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The coresets approach, also called subsampling or subset selection, aims to select a subsample as a surrogate for the observed sample and has found extensive applications in large-scale data analysis. Existing coresets methods construct the subsample using a subset of rows from the predictor matrix. Such methods can be significantly inefficient when the predictor matrix is sparse or numerically sparse. To overcome this limitation, we develop a novel element-wise subset selection approach, called core-elements, for large-scale least squares estimation. We provide a deterministic algorithm to construct the core-elements estimator, only requiring an $O(\mathrm{nnz}(X)+rp^2)$ computational cost, where $X$ is an $n\times p$ predictor matrix, $r$ is the number of elements selected from each column of $X$, and $\mathrm{nnz}(\cdot)$ denotes the number of non-zero elements. Theoretically, we show that the proposed estimator is unbiased and approximately minimizes an upper bound of the estimation variance. We also provide an approximation guarantee by deriving a coresets-like finite sample bound for the proposed estimator. To handle potential outliers in the data, we further combine core-elements with the median-of-means procedure, resulting in an efficient and robust estimator with theoretical consistency guarantees. Numerical studies on various synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the proposed method's superior performance compared to mainstream competitors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Statistics and Computing</p></details> |

Aspect ratio commonly arises as a complexity measure in graph algorithms, especially related to the computation of shortest paths. Popular paradigms are to interpolate between the settings of weighted and unweighted input graphs by incurring a dependence on aspect ratio, or by simply restricting attention to input graphs of low aspect ratio. This paper studies the effects of these paradigms, investigating whether graphs of low aspect ratio have more structured shortest paths than graphs in general. In particular, we raise the question of whether one can generally take a graph of large aspect ratio and reweight its edges, to obtain a graph with bounded aspect ratio while preserving the structure of its shortest paths. Our findings are: - Every weighted DAG on $n$ nodes has a shortest-paths preserving graph of aspect ratio $O(n)$. A simple lower bound shows that this is tight. - The previous result does not extend to general directed or undirected graphs; in fact, the answer turns out to be exponential in these settings. In particular, we construct directed and undirected $n$-node graphs for which any shortest-paths preserving graph has aspect ratio $2^{\Omega(n)}$. We also consider the approximate version of this problem, where the goal is for shortest paths in $H$ to correspond to approximate shortest paths in $G$. We show that our exponential lower bounds extend even to this setting. We also show that in a closely related model, where approximate shortest paths in $H$ must also correspond to approximate shortest paths in $G$, even DAGs require exponential aspect ratio.</p></details> | ITCS 2024 |

However, this convenience raises substantial concerns about unauthorized access to users' privacy-sensitive information, which could be further abused for illegitimate purposes like user tracking or monetization. Our study offers a targeted analysis of user privacy protection among Android third-party SDKs, filling a critical gap in the Android software supply chain. It focuses on two aspects of their privacy practices, including data exfiltration and behavior-policy compliance (or privacy compliance), utilizing techniques of taint analysis and large language models. It covers 158 widely-used SDKs from two key SDK release platforms, the official one and a large alternative one. From them, we identified 338 instances of privacy data exfiltration. On the privacy compliance, our study reveals that more than 30% of the examined SDKs fail to provide a privacy policy to disclose their data handling practices. Among those that provide privacy policies, 37% of them over-collect user data, and 88% falsely claim access to sensitive data. We revisit the latest versions of the SDKs after 12 months. Our analysis demonstrates a persistent lack of improvement in these concerning trends. Based on our findings, we propose three actionable recommendations to mitigate the privacy leakage risks and enhance privacy protection for Android users. Our research not only serves as an urgent call for industry attention but also provides crucial insights for future regulatory interventions.</p></details> | 16 pages |

However, narrowing the performance gap with supervised systems remains an ongoing challenge. Several studies have observed that speech representations from large-scale ASR models contain valuable speaker information. This work explores the limitations of fine-tuning these models for SV using an SSL contrastive objective in an end-to-end approach. Then, we propose a framework to learn speaker representations in an SSL context by fine-tuning a pre-trained WavLM with a supervised loss using pseudo-labels. Initial pseudo-labels are derived from an SSL DINO-based model and are iteratively refined by clustering the model embeddings. Our method achieves 0.99% EER on VoxCeleb1-O, establishing the new state-of-the-art on self-supervised SV. As this performance is close to our supervised baseline of 0.94% EER, this contribution is a step towards supervised performance on SV with SSL.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at INTERSPEECH 2024</p></details> |

Previous studies have attempted to alleviate this by identifying noisy samples based on their diverged patterns, such as higher loss values, and mitigating the noise through sample dropping or reweighting. Despite the progress, we observe existing approaches struggle to distinguish hard samples and noise samples, as they often exhibit similar patterns, thereby limiting their effectiveness in denoising recommendations. To address this challenge, we propose a Large Language Model Enhanced Hard Sample Denoising (LLMHD) framework. Specifically, we construct an LLM-based scorer to evaluate the semantic consistency of items with the user preference, which is quantified based on summarized historical user interactions. The resulting scores are used to assess the hardness of samples for the pointwise or pairwise training objectives. To ensure efficiency, we introduce a variance-based sample pruning strategy to filter potential hard samples before scoring. Besides, we propose an iterative preference update module designed to continuously refine summarized user preference, which may be biased due to false-positive user-item interactions. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets and four backbone recommenders demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

The goal is to use a small set of (benign) binary questions, typically under 20. We formalize the problem and first establish a baseline using a random selection of questions from known benchmark datasets, achieving an accuracy of nearly 100% within 20 questions. After showing optimal bounds for this problem, we introduce two effective questioning heuristics able to discriminate 22 LLMs by using half as many questions for the same task. These methods offer significant advantages in terms of stealth and are thus of interest to auditors or copyright owners facing suspicions of model leaks.</p></details> |  |

We delve into three primary dimensions: HRI contexts, vision-based tasks, and specific domains. The empirical evaluation was implemented among 15 experts across six evaluated metrics, showcasing the primary efficacy in relevant decision-making scenarios. We explore the process of ideation and potential application scenarios, envisioning this design space as a foundational guideline for future HRI system design, emphasizing accurate domain alignment and model selection.</p></details> |  |

| **[Do Membership Inference Attacks Work on Large Language Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07841v2)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Membership inference attacks (MIAs) attempt to predict whether a particular datapoint is a member of a target model's training data. Despite extensive research on traditional machine learning models, there has been limited work studying MIA on the pre-training data of large language models (LLMs). We perform a large-scale evaluation of MIAs over a suite of language models (LMs) trained on the Pile, ranging from 160M to 12B parameters. We find that MIAs barely outperform random guessing for most settings across varying LLM sizes and domains. Our further analyses reveal that this poor performance can be attributed to (1) the combination of a large dataset and few training iterations, and (2) an inherently fuzzy boundary between members and non-members. We identify specific settings where LLMs have been shown to be vulnerable to membership inference and show that the apparent success in such settings can be attributed to a distribution shift, such as when members and non-members are drawn from the seemingly identical domain but with different temporal ranges. We release our code and data as a unified benchmark package that includes all existing MIAs, supporting future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Conference on Language Modeling (COLM), 2024</p></details> |
| **[SteeredMarigold: Steering Diffusion Towards Depth Completion of Largely Incomplete Depth Maps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10202v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Even if the depth maps captured by RGB-D sensors deployed in real environments are often characterized by large areas missing valid depth measurements, the vast majority of depth completion methods still assumes depth values covering all areas of the scene. To address this limitation, we introduce SteeredMarigold, a training-free, zero-shot depth completion method capable of producing metric dense depth, even for largely incomplete depth maps. SteeredMarigold achieves this by using the available sparse depth points as conditions to steer a denoising diffusion probabilistic model. Our method outperforms relevant top-performing methods on the NYUv2 dataset, in tests where no depth was provided for a large area, achieving state-of-art performance and exhibiting remarkable robustness against depth map incompleteness. Our code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fit and Prune: Fast and Training-free Visual Token Pruning for Multi-modal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10197v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) often use large image tokens to compensate the visual shortcoming of MLLMs, which not only exhibits obvious redundancy but also greatly exacerbates the already high computation. Token pruning is an effective solution for speeding up MLLMs, but when and how to drop tokens still remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel and training-free approach for the effective visual token pruning of MLLMs, termed FitPrune, which can quickly produce a complete pruning recipe for MLLMs according to a pre-defined budget. Specifically, FitPrune considers token pruning as a statistical problem of MLLM and its objective is to find out an optimal pruning scheme that can minimize the divergence of the attention distributions before and after pruning. In practice, FitPrune can be quickly accomplished based on the attention statistics from a small batch of inference data, avoiding the expensive trials of MLLMs. According to the pruning recipe, an MLLM can directly remove the redundant visual tokens of different examples during inference. To validate FitPrune, we apply it to a set of recent MLLMs, including LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-HR and LLaVA-NEXT, and conduct extensive experiments on a set of benchmarks. The experimental results show that our FitPrune can not only reduce the computational complexity to a large extent, while retaining high performance, e.g., -54.9% FLOPs for LLaVA-NEXT with only 0.5% accuracy drop. Notably, the pruning recipe can be obtained in about 5 minutes. Our code is available at https://github.com/ywh187/FitPrune.</p></details> |  |

This model focuses on providing clear and easy-to-understand answers for both healthcare professionals and patients, thereby improving the efficiency of diagnosis and treatment processes. Human evaluation was conducted to ensure that the model adheres to care standards and provides unbiased answers. To prioritize data security, the model is deployed within the hospital's internal network, ensuring both high security and faster processing speeds. The internal API connection is secured with encryption and strict authentication measures to prevent data leaks and unauthorized access. We evaluated several open-source large language models with 8 billion parameters on four medical benchmarks: MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and the medical subset of MMLU. The best-performing baselines were used to develop Eir-8B. Our evaluation employed multiple questioning strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought reasoning, and ensemble/self-consistency voting methods. Our model outperformed commercially available Thai-language large language models by more than 10%. In addition, we developed enhanced model testing tailored for clinical use in Thai across 18 clinical tasks, where our model exceeded GPT-4o performance by more than 11%.</p></details> | <details><summary>typos...</summary><p>typos corrected, and references added</p></details> |

| **[StruEdit: Structured Outputs Enable the Fast and Accurate Knowledge Editing for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10132v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the modern tool of choice for question answering, large language models (LLMs) are expected to deliver answers with up-to-date knowledge. To achieve such ideal question-answering systems, locating and then editing outdated knowledge in the natural language outputs is a general target of popular knowledge editing methods. However, this target is challenging, as both identifying which tokens to edit in the reasoning steps and ensuring the coherence of the revised reasoning chain are difficult tasks. We argue that these challenges stem from the unstructured nature of natural language outputs. To address the above challenges, we propose $\textbf{Stru}$ctural $\textbf{Edit}$ing ($\textbf{StruEdit}$), an improved baseline for knowledge editing. We first prompt LLMs to produce structured outputs consisting of reasoning triplets. Then, StruEdit removes any potentially outdated knowledge and efficiently refills the structured outputs with up-to-date information in a single step. Experimental results show that StruEdit consistently delivers the highest accuracy with lowest latency compared with other knowledge editing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large language models and linguistic intentionality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09576v2)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Do large language models like Chat-GPT or LLaMa meaningfully use the words they produce? Or are they merely clever prediction machines, simulating language use by producing statistically plausible text? There have already been some initial attempts to answer this question by showing that these models meet the criteria for entering meaningful states according to metasemantic theories of mental content. In this paper, I will argue for a different approach - that we should instead consider whether language models meet the criteria given by our best metasemantic theories of linguistic content. In that vein, I will illustrate how this can be done by applying two such theories to the case of language models: Gareth Evans' (1982) account of naming practices and Ruth Millikan's (1984, 2004, 2005) teleosemantics. In doing so, I will argue that it is a mistake to think that the failure of LLMs to meet plausible conditions for mental intentionality thereby renders their outputs meaningless, and that a distinguishing feature of linguistic intentionality - dependency on a pre-existing linguistic system - allows for the plausible result LLM outputs are meaningful.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-DER:A Named Entity Recognition Method Based on Large Language Models for Chinese Coal Chemical Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10077v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain-specific Named Entity Recognition (NER), whose goal is to recognize domain-specific entities and their categories, provides an important support for constructing domain knowledge graphs. Currently, deep learning-based methods are widely used and effective in NER tasks, but due to the reliance on large-scale labeled data. As a result, the scarcity of labeled data in a specific domain will limit its application.Therefore, many researches started to introduce few-shot methods and achieved some results. However, the entity structures in specific domains are often complex, and the current few-shot methods are difficult to adapt to NER tasks with complex features.Taking the Chinese coal chemical industry domain as an example,there exists a complex structure of multiple entities sharing a single entity, as well as multiple relationships for the same pair of entities, which affects the NER task under the sample less condition.In this paper, we propose a Large Language Models (LLMs)-based entity recognition framework LLM-DER for the domain-specific entity recognition problem in Chinese, which enriches the entity information by generating a list of relationships containing entity types through LLMs, and designing a plausibility and consistency evaluation method to remove misrecognized entities, which can effectively solve the complex structural entity recognition problem in a specific domain.The experimental results of this paper on the Resume dataset and the self-constructed coal chemical dataset Coal show that LLM-DER performs outstandingly in domain-specific entity recognition, not only outperforming the existing GPT-3.5-turbo baseline, but also exceeding the fully-supervised baseline, verifying its effectiveness in entity recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[LeGEND: A Top-Down Approach to Scenario Generation of Autonomous Driving Systems Assisted by Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10066v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving systems (ADS) are safety-critical and require comprehensive testing before their deployment on public roads. While existing testing approaches primarily aim at the criticality of scenarios, they often overlook the diversity of the generated scenarios that is also important to reflect system defects in different aspects. To bridge the gap, we propose LeGEND, that features a top-down fashion of scenario generation: it starts with abstract functional scenarios, and then steps downwards to logical and concrete scenarios, such that scenario diversity can be controlled at the functional level. However, unlike logical scenarios that can be formally described, functional scenarios are often documented in natural languages (e.g., accident reports) and thus cannot be precisely parsed and processed by computers. To tackle that issue, LeGEND leverages the recent advances of large language models (LLMs) to transform textual functional scenarios to formal logical scenarios. To mitigate the distraction of useless information in functional scenario description, we devise a two-phase transformation that features the use of an intermediate language; consequently, we adopt two LLMs in LeGEND, one for extracting information from functional scenarios, the other for converting the extracted information to formal logical scenarios. We experimentally evaluate LeGEND on Apollo, an industry-grade ADS from Baidu. Evaluation results show that LeGEND can effectively identify critical scenarios, and compared to baseline approaches, LeGEND exhibits evident superiority in diversity of generated scenarios. Moreover, we also demonstrate the advantages of our two-phase transformation framework, and the accuracy of the adopted LLMs.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a benchmark dataset to evaluate uncertainty metrics, focusing on Answer, Correctness, Aleatoric, and Epistemic Uncertainty. Through analysis of models like GPT-3.5-Turbo and Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, we show that current metrics align more with Answer Uncertainty, which reflects output confidence and diversity, rather than Correctness Uncertainty, highlighting the need for improved metrics that are optimization-objective-aware to better guide prompt optimization.

It focuses on using advanced models to create secure, HIPAA-compliant synthetic patient notes for biomedical research. The study used de-identified and re-identified MIMIC III datasets with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Mistral 7B to generate synthetic notes. Text generation employed templates and keyword extraction for contextually relevant notes, with one-shot generation for comparison. Privacy assessment checked PHI occurrence, while text utility was tested using an ICD-9 coding task. Text quality was evaluated with ROUGE and cosine similarity metrics to measure semantic similarity with source notes. Analysis of PHI occurrence and text utility via the ICD-9 coding task showed that the keyword-based method had low risk and good performance. One-shot generation showed the highest PHI exposure and PHI co-occurrence, especially in geographic location and date categories. The Normalized One-shot method achieved the highest classification accuracy. Privacy analysis revealed a critical balance between data utility and privacy protection, influencing future data use and sharing. Re-identified data consistently outperformed de-identified data. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of keyword-based methods in generating privacy-protecting synthetic clinical notes that retain data usability, potentially transforming clinical data-sharing practices. The superior performance of re-identified over de-identified data suggests a shift towards methods that enhance utility and privacy by using dummy PHIs to perplex privacy attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, 1 supplementary, under review</p></details> |

This paper introduces V2X-VLM, an innovative E2E vehicle-infrastructure cooperative autonomous driving (VICAD) framework with Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) systems and large vision-language models (VLMs). V2X-VLM is designed to enhance situational awareness, decision-making, and ultimate trajectory planning by integrating multimodel data from vehicle-mounted cameras, infrastructure sensors, and textual information. The contrastive learning method is further employed to complement VLM by refining feature discrimination, assisting the model to learn robust representations of the driving environment. Evaluations on the DAIR-V2X dataset show that V2X-VLM outperforms state-of-the-art cooperative autonomous driving methods, while additional tests on corner cases validate its robustness in real-world driving conditions.</p></details> |  |

The advancement of LLM techniques also offers promising opportunities to automate many tasks in the telecommunication (telecom) field. After pre-training and fine-tuning, LLMs can perform diverse downstream tasks based on human instructions, paving the way to artificial general intelligence (AGI)-enabled 6G. Given the great potential of LLM technologies, this work aims to provide a comprehensive overview of LLM-enabled telecom networks. In particular, we first present LLM fundamentals, including model architecture, pre-training, fine-tuning, inference and utilization, model evaluation, and telecom deployment. Then, we introduce LLM-enabled key techniques and telecom applications in terms of generation, classification, optimization, and prediction problems. Specifically, the LLM-enabled generation applications include telecom domain knowledge, code, and network configuration generation. After that, the LLM-based classification applications involve network security, text, image, and traffic classification problems. Moreover, multiple LLM-enabled optimization techniques are introduced, such as automated reward function design for reinforcement learning and verbal reinforcement learning. Furthermore, for LLM-aided prediction problems, we discussed time-series prediction models and multi-modality prediction problems for telecom. Finally, we highlight the challenges and identify the future directions of LLM-enabled telecom networks.</p></details> |  |

However, their unprecedented scale comes with significant computational costs. These models, often consisting of billions of parameters, require vast amounts of computational resources for execution. Especially, the expansive scale and computational demands pose considerable challenges when customizing them for particular downstream tasks, particularly over the hardware platforms constrained by computational capabilities. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) provides a practical solution by efficiently adjusting the large models over the various downstream tasks. In particular, PEFT refers to the process of adjusting the parameters of a pre-trained large model to adapt it to a specific task or domain while minimizing the number of additional parameters introduced or computational resources required. This approach is particularly important when dealing with large-scale language models with high parameter counts, as fine-tuning these models from scratch can be computationally expensive and resource-intensive, posing considerable challenges in the supporting system platform design. In this survey, we present comprehensive studies of various PEFT algorithms, examining their performance and computational overhead. Moreover, we provide an overview of applications developed using different PEFT algorithms and discuss common techniques employed to mitigate computation costs for PEFT. In addition to providing an extensive survey from an algorithmic standpoint, we also examine various real-world system designs to investigate the implementation costs associated with different PEFT approaches. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers aiming to understand both the PEFT algorithm and its system implementation, offering detailed ......</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 12 figures.

| **[High-Performance Distributed Control for Large-Scale Linear Systems: A Partitioned Distributed Observer Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06903v2)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the distributed-observer-based distributed control law has shown powerful ability to arbitrarily approximate the centralized control performance. However, the traditional distributed observer requires each local observer to reconstruct the state information of the whole system, which is unrealistic for large-scale scenarios. To fill this gap, this paper develops a greedy-idea-based large-scale system partition algorithm, which can significantly reduce the dimension of local observers. Then, the partitioned distributed observer for large-scale systems is proposed to overcome the problem that the system dynamics are difficult to estimate due to the coupling between partitions. Furthermore, the two-layer Lyapunov analysis method is adopted and the dynamic transformation lemma of compact errors is proven, which solves the problem of analyzing stability of the error dynamic of the partitioned distributed observer. Finally, it is proved that the distributed control law based on the partitioned distributed observer can also arbitrarily approximate the control performance of the centralized control law, and the dimension of the local observer is greatly reduced compared with the traditional method. The simulation results show that when the similarity between the physical network and the communication network is about 80%, the local observer dimension is greatly reduced by 90% and the relative error between the performance of the distributed control law and that of the centralized control law is less than 1%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Data Contamination Detection for Modern Large Language Models: Limitations, Inconsistencies, and Oracle Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09927v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models achieve increasingly impressive results, questions arise about whether such performance is from generalizability or mere data memorization. Thus, numerous data contamination detection methods have been proposed. However, these approaches are often validated with traditional benchmarks and early-stage LLMs, leaving uncertainty about their effectiveness when evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs on the contamination of more challenging benchmarks. To address this gap and provide a dual investigation of SOTA LLM contamination status and detection method robustness, we evaluate five contamination detection approaches with four state-of-the-art LLMs across eight challenging datasets often used in modern LLM evaluation. Our analysis reveals that (1) Current methods have non-trivial limitations in their assumptions and practical applications; (2) Notable difficulties exist in detecting contamination introduced during instruction fine-tuning with answer augmentation; and (3) Limited consistencies between SOTA contamination detection techniques. These findings highlight the complexity of contamination detection in advanced LLMs and the urgent need for further research on robust and generalizable contamination evaluation.

First, we explore the audio analysis capabilities of GPT-4o. Second, we propose GPT-Whisper, which uses Whisper as an audio-to-text module and evaluates the naturalness of text via targeted prompt engineering. We evaluate assessment metrics predicted by GPT-4o and GPT-Whisper examining their correlations with human-based quality and intelligibility assessments, and character error rate (CER) of automatic speech recognition. Experimental results show that GPT-4o alone is not effective for audio analysis; whereas, GPT-Whisper demonstrates higher prediction, showing moderate correlation with speech quality and intelligibility, and high correlation with CER. Compared to supervised non-intrusive neural speech assessment models, namely MOS-SSL and MTI-Net, GPT-Whisper yields a notably higher Spearman's rank correlation with the CER of Whisper. These findings validate GPT-Whisper as a reliable method for accurate zero-shot speech assessment without requiring additional training data (speech data and corresponding assessment scores).</p></details> |  |
| **[Rediscovering the Latent Dimensions of Personality with Large Language Models as Trait Descriptors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09905v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing personality traits using large language models (LLMs) has emerged as an interesting and challenging area of research. While previous methods employ explicit questionnaires, often derived from the Big Five model of personality, we hypothesize that LLMs implicitly encode notions of personality when modeling next-token responses. To demonstrate this, we introduce a novel approach that uncovers latent personality dimensions in LLMs by applying singular value de-composition (SVD) to the log-probabilities of trait-descriptive adjectives. Our experiments show that LLMs "rediscover" core personality traits such as extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness without relying on direct questionnaire inputs, with the top-5 factors corresponding to Big Five traits explaining 74.3% of the variance in the latent space. Moreover, we can use the derived principal components to assess personality along the Big Five dimensions, and achieve improvements in average personality prediction accuracy of up to 5% over fine-tuned models, and up to 21% over direct LLM-based scoring techniques.</p></details> |  |

The model has recently attracted attention in the AI literature, under the name softmax mixtures, where it is routinely used in the final layer of a neural network to map a large number $p$ of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^L$ to a probability vector. Despite its wide applicability and empirical success, statistically optimal estimators of the mixture parameters, obtained via algorithms whose running time scales polynomially in $L$, are not known. This paper provides a solution to this problem for contemporary applications, such as large language models, in which the mixture has a large number $p$ of support points, and the size $N$ of the sample observed from the mixture is also large. Our proposed estimator combines two classical estimators, obtained respectively via a method of moments (MoM) and the expectation-minimization (EM) algorithm. Although both estimator types have been studied, from a theoretical perspective, for Gaussian mixtures, no similar results exist for softmax mixtures for either procedure. We develop a new MoM parameter estimator based on latent moment estimation that is tailored to our model, and provide the first theoretical analysis for a MoM-based procedure in softmax mixtures. Although consistent, MoM for softmax mixtures can exhibit poor numerical performance, as observed other mixture models. Nevertheless, as MoM is provably in a neighborhood of the target, it can be used as warm start for any iterative algorithm. We study in detail the EM algorithm, and provide its first theoretical analysis for softmax mixtures. Our final proposal for parameter estimation is the EM algorithm with a MoM warm start.</p></details> |  |

Traditional model-based controllers for these robots assume no slipping. While reinforcement learning (RL) helps quadruped robots adapt to different surfaces, recovering from slips remains challenging, especially for systems with few contact points. Estimating the ground friction coefficient is another open challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel friction-aware safety locomotion framework that integrates Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) with a RL policy. Our approach explicitly incorporates the estimated friction coefficient into the RL policy, enabling the robot to adapt its behavior in advance based on the surface type before reaching it. We introduce a Friction-From-Vision (FFV) module, which leverages LVLMs to estimate ground friction coefficients, eliminating the need for large datasets and extensive training. The framework was validated on a customized wheeled inverted pendulum, and experimental results demonstrate that our framework increases the success rate in completing driving tasks by adjusting speed according to terrain type, while achieving better tracking performance compared to baseline methods. Our framework can be simply integrated with any other RL policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to icra2025</p></details> |

However, the complex traits and heterogeneity of multi-sources genomics data pose significant challenges when adapting these models to the bioinformatics and biomedical field. To address these challenges, we present GP-GPT, the first specialized large language model for genetic-phenotype knowledge representation and genomics relation analysis. Our model is fine-tuned in two stages on a comprehensive corpus composed of over 3,000,000 terms in genomics, proteomics, and medical genetics, derived from multiple large-scale validated datasets and scientific publications. GP-GPT demonstrates proficiency in accurately retrieving medical genetics information and performing common genomics analysis tasks, such as genomics information retrieval and relationship determination. Comparative experiments across domain-specific tasks reveal that GP-GPT outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs, including Llama2, Llama3 and GPT-4. These results highlight GP-GPT's potential to enhance genetic disease relation research and facilitate accurate and efficient analysis in the fields of genomics and medical genetics. Our investigation demonstrated the subtle changes of bio-factor entities' representations in the GP-GPT, which suggested the opportunities for the application of LLMs to advancing gene-phenotype research.</p></details> |  |

A promising approach is to enforce safety constraints through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). For such constrained RLHF, common Lagrangian-based primal-dual policy optimization methods are computationally expensive and often unstable. This paper presents a dualization perspective that reduces constrained alignment to an equivalent unconstrained alignment problem. We do so by pre-optimizing a smooth and convex dual function that has a closed form. This shortcut eliminates the need for cumbersome primal-dual policy iterations, thus greatly reducing the computational burden and improving training stability. Our strategy leads to two practical algorithms in model-based and preference-based scenarios (MoCAN and PeCAN, respectively). A broad range of experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</p></details> |  |

We focus on the steerability of the Llama-2 and Llama-3 suite of models, examining their ability to maintain these strategies throughout interactions. To assess this, we introduce the Strategy Relevant Attention (SRA) metric, which quantifies the model's adherence to the prompted strategy through attention maps. To facilitate our study, we create a strategy-conditioned synthetic conversational dataset derived from the ESConv dataset. We also propose various baselines informed by our proposed SRA metric to address the challenge and propose a fine-tuned model that significantly enhances the steerability of the base model in following the strategy throughout the conversation.

With the growing demand of unmanned function vehicles, near-field scene understanding becomes an important research topic in the areas of low-speed autonomous driving. Due to the complexity of driving conditions and diversity of near obstacles such as blind spots and high occlusion, the perception capability of near-field environment is still inferior than its farther counterpart. To further enhance the intelligent ability of unmanned vehicles, in this paper, we construct a multimodal data collection platform based on 3 main types of sensors (Camera, LiDAR and Fisheye), which supports flexible sensor configurations to enable dynamic sight of view for ego vehicle, either global view or local view. Meanwhile, a large-scale multi-sensor dataset is built, named RoboSense, to facilitate near-field scene understanding. RoboSense contains more than 133K synchronized data with 1.4M 3D bounding box and IDs annotated in the full $360^{\circ}$ view, forming 216K trajectories across 7.6K temporal sequences. It has $270\times$ and $18\times$ as many annotations of near-field obstacles within 5$m$ as the previous single-vehicle datasets such as KITTI and nuScenes. Moreover, we define a novel matching criterion for near-field 3D perception and prediction metrics. Based on RoboSense, we formulate 6 popular tasks to facilitate the future development of related research, where the detailed data analysis as well as benchmarks are also provided accordingly.</p></details> |  |

Honeypots, which are decoy systems designed to lure and interact with attackers, have emerged as a critical component in cybersecurity. In this paper, we present a novel approach to creating realistic and interactive honeypot systems using Large Language Models (LLMs). By fine-tuning a pre-trained open-source language model on a diverse dataset of attacker-generated commands and responses, we developed a honeypot capable of sophisticated engagement with attackers. Our methodology involved several key steps: data collection and processing, prompt engineering, model selection, and supervised fine-tuning to optimize the model's performance. Evaluation through similarity metrics and live deployment demonstrated that our approach effectively generates accurate and informative responses. The results highlight the potential of LLMs to revolutionize honeypot technology, providing cybersecurity professionals with a powerful tool to detect and analyze malicious activity, thereby enhancing overall security infrastructure.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |

Thus, benchmarking and advancing techniques detecting digital manipulation become an urgent issue. Although there have been a number of publicly available face forgery datasets, the forgery faces are mostly generated using GAN-based synthesis technology, which does not involve the most recent technologies like diffusion. The diversity and quality of images generated by diffusion models have been significantly improved and thus a much more challenging face forgery dataset shall be used to evaluate SOTA forgery detection literature. In this paper, we propose a large-scale, diverse, and fine-grained high-fidelity dataset, namely GenFace, to facilitate the advancement of deepfake detection, which contains a large number of forgery faces generated by advanced generators such as the diffusion-based model and more detailed labels about the manipulation approaches and adopted generators. In addition to evaluating SOTA approaches on our benchmark, we design an innovative cross appearance-edge learning (CAEL) detector to capture multi-grained appearance and edge global representations, and detect discriminative and general forgery traces. Moreover, we devise an appearance-edge cross-attention (AECA) module to explore the various integrations across two domains. Extensive experiment results and visualizations show that our detection model outperforms the state of the arts on different settings like cross-generator, cross-forgery, and cross-dataset evaluations.

While model-driven approaches attempt to enhance MLLMs capabilities through diverse architectures, the gains have become increasingly marginal. Conversely, data-driven methods, which scale up image-text instruction data, are more effective but face limited data diversity and complexity challenges. The absence of high-quality data constitutes a significant development barrier for MLLMs. To address the data quality bottleneck, we propose MMEvol, a novel multimodal instruction data evolution framework. This framework iteratively improve data quality through a refined combination of fine-grained perception, cognitive reasoning, and interaction evolution, generating a more complex and diverse image-text instruction dataset that empowers MLLMs with enhanced capabilities. Beginning with an initial set of instructions, SEED-163K, we utilize MMEvol to systematically broaden the diversity of instruction types, extend visual reasoning steps to improve cognitive reasoning abilities, and thoroughly explore fine-grained information within images to enhance visual understanding and robustness. To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive qualitative analysis and quantitative experiments across 13 vision-language tasks. Compared to baseline models trained with the initial seed data, the results demonstrate that our method achieves an average accuracy improvement of 3.1 percentage points. Furthermore, our approach reaches state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in nine tasks using significantly less data compared to state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |

A few now-infamous attacks in Ethereum's history includes DAO attack in 2016 (50 million dollars lost), Parity Wallet hack in 2017 (146 million dollars locked), Beautychain's token BEC in 2018 (900 million dollars market value fell to 0), and NFT gaming blockchain breach in 2022 ($600 million in Ether stolen). This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of the use of large language models (LLMs) and their capabilities in detecting OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities in Solidity. We introduce a novel, class-balanced, structured, and labeled dataset named VulSmart, which we use to benchmark and compare the performance of open-source LLMs such as CodeLlama, Llama2, CodeT5 and Falcon, alongside closed-source models like GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o Mini. Our proposed SmartVD framework is rigorously tested against these models through extensive automated and manual evaluations, utilizing BLEU and ROUGE metrics to assess the effectiveness of vulnerability detection in smart contracts. We also explore three distinct prompting strategies-zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought-to evaluate the multi-class classification and generative capabilities of the SmartVD framework. Our findings reveal that SmartVD outperforms its open-source counterparts and even exceeds the performance of closed-source base models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 Mini. After fine-tuning, the closed-source models, GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o Mini, achieved remarkable performance with 99% accuracy in detecting vulnerabilities, 94% in identifying their types, and 98% in determining severity. Notably, SmartVD performs best with the `chain-of-thought' prompting technique, whereas the fine-tuned closed-source models excel with the `zero-shot' prompting approach.</p></details> |  |

Pre-training on large-scale images achieves promising results in various tasks, but prior 3D hand pose pre-training methods have not fully utilized the potential of diverse hand images accessible from in-the-wild videos. To facilitate scalable pre-training, we first prepare an extensive pool of hand images from in-the-wild videos and design our method with contrastive learning. Specifically, we collected over 2.0M hand images from recent human-centric videos, such as 100DOH and Ego4D. To extract discriminative information from these images, we focus on the similarity of hands; pairs of similar hand poses originating from different samples, and propose a novel contrastive learning method that embeds similar hand pairs closer in the latent space. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms conventional contrastive learning approaches that produce positive pairs sorely from a single image with data augmentation. We achieve significant improvements over the state-of-the-art method in various datasets, with gains of 15% on FreiHand, 10% on DexYCB, and 4% on AssemblyHands.</p></details> | <details><summary>HANDS...</summary><p>HANDS@ECCV24 (Extended Abstracts)</p></details> |

The task of association rule mining successfully discovers regular patterns in item sets and substructures. Still, to our best knowledge, this concept has not yet been extended to path patterns in large property graphs. In this paper, we introduce the problem of path association rule mining (PARM). Applied to any \emph{reachability path} between two vertices within a large graph, PARM discovers regular ways in which path patterns, identified by vertex attributes and edge labels, co-occur with each other. We develop an efficient and scalable algorithm PIONEER that exploits an anti-monotonicity property to effectively prune the search space. Further, we devise approximation techniques and employ parallelization to achieve scalable path association rule mining. Our experimental study using real-world graph data verifies the significance of path association rules and the efficiency of our solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Open-Source Large Language Models for Native Language Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09659v1)** | 2024-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Native Language Identification (NLI) - the task of identifying the native language (L1) of a person based on their writing in the second language (L2) - has applications in forensics, marketing, and second language acquisition. Historically, conventional machine learning approaches that heavily rely on extensive feature engineering have outperformed transformer-based language models on this task. Recently, closed-source generative large language models (LLMs), e.g., GPT-4, have demonstrated remarkable performance on NLI in a zero-shot setting, including promising results in open-set classification. However, closed-source LLMs have many disadvantages, such as high costs and undisclosed nature of training data. This study explores the potential of using open-source LLMs for NLI. Our results indicate that open-source LLMs do not reach the accuracy levels of closed-source LLMs when used out-of-the-box. However, when fine-tuned on labeled training data, open-source LLMs can achieve performance comparable to that of commercial LLMs.</p></details> |  |

By applying a comprehensive analytical framework that includes Odds Ratio (OR) analysis, Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT), sentiment analysis, and contextual analysis, this paper identified patterns of gender-associated language reflecting societal stereotypes. Specifically, words related to approachability and support were used more frequently for female instructors, while words related to entertainment were predominantly used for male instructors, aligning with the concepts of communal and agentic behaviors. The study also found moderate to strong associations between male salient adjectives and male names, though career and family words did not distinctly capture gender biases. These findings align with prior research on societal norms and stereotypes, reinforcing the notion that LLM-generated text reflects existing biases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Large Language Models Really Good Logical Reasoners? A Comprehensive Evaluation and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09841v4)** | 2024-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logical reasoning consistently plays a fundamental and significant role in the domains of knowledge engineering and artificial intelligence. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a noteworthy innovation in natural language processing (NLP). However, the question of whether LLMs can effectively address the task of logical reasoning, which requires gradual cognitive inference similar to human intelligence, remains unanswered. To this end, we aim to bridge this gap and provide comprehensive evaluations in this paper. Firstly, to offer systematic evaluations, we select fifteen typical logical reasoning datasets and organize them into deductive, inductive, abductive and mixed-form reasoning settings. Considering the comprehensiveness of evaluations, we include 3 early-era representative LLMs and 4 trending LLMs. Secondly, different from previous evaluations relying only on simple metrics (e.g., \emph{accuracy}), we propose fine-level evaluations in objective and subjective manners, covering both answers and explanations, including \emph{answer correctness}, \emph{explain correctness}, \emph{explain completeness} and \emph{explain redundancy}. Additionally, to uncover the logical flaws of LLMs, problematic cases will be attributed to five error types from two dimensions, i.e., \emph{evidence selection process} and \emph{reasoning process}. Thirdly, to avoid the influences of knowledge bias and concentrate purely on benchmarking the logical reasoning capability of LLMs, we propose a new dataset with neutral content. Based on the in-depth evaluations, this paper finally forms a general evaluation scheme of logical reasoning capability from six dimensions (i.e., \emph{Correct}, \emph{Rigorous}, \emph{Self-aware}, \emph{Active}, \emph{Oriented} and \emph{No hallucination}). It reflects the pros and cons of LLMs and gives guiding directions for future works.</p></details> | 37 pages, 16 figures |

Exploring Pure Zero-Shot Event-based Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09628v1)** | 2024-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in event-based zero-shot object recognition have demonstrated promising results. However, these methods heavily depend on extensive training and are inherently constrained by the characteristics of CLIP. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first study to explore the understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for event-based visual content. We demonstrate that LLMs can achieve event-based object recognition without additional training or fine-tuning in conjunction with CLIP, effectively enabling pure zero-shot event-based recognition. Particularly, we evaluate the ability of GPT-4o / 4turbo and two other open-source LLMs to directly recognize event-based visual content. Extensive experiments are conducted across three benchmark datasets, systematically assessing the recognition accuracy of these models. The results show that LLMs, especially when enhanced with well-designed prompts, significantly improve event-based zero-shot recognition performance. Notably, GPT-4o outperforms the compared models and exceeds the recognition accuracy of state-of-the-art event-based zero-shot methods on N-ImageNet by five orders of magnitude.

Traditional estimation techniques, although widely utilized, often fall short due to their complexity and the dynamic nature of software development projects. This study introduces an innovative approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the accuracy and usability of project cost predictions. We explore the efficacy of LLMs against traditional methods and contemporary machine learning techniques, focusing on their potential to simplify the estimation process and provide higher accuracy. Our research is structured around critical inquiries into whether LLMs can outperform existing models, the ease of their integration into current practices, outperform traditional estimation, and why traditional methods still prevail in industry settings. By applying LLMs to a range of real-world datasets and comparing their performance to both state-of-the-art and conventional methods, this study aims to demonstrate that LLMs not only yield more accurate estimates but also offer a user-friendly alternative to complex predictive models, potentially transforming project management strategies within the software industry.</p></details> |  |

For this purpose, KenLM, a lightweight n-gram-based language model that operates on CPUs, is widely used. However, the traditional method of training KenLM utilizes only high-quality data and, consequently, does not explicitly learn the linguistic patterns of low-quality data. To address this issue, we propose an ensemble approach that leverages two contrasting KenLMs: (i) Good KenLM, trained on high-quality data; and (ii) Bad KenLM, trained on low-quality data. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces noisy content while preserving high-quality content compared to the traditional KenLM training method. This indicates that our method can be a practical solution with minimal computational overhead for resource-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |

However, their application to sensitive, domain-specific fields like healthcare remains challenging, primarily due to the difficulty of fine-tuning these models for specialized, out-of-domain tasks with scarce publicly available datasets. In this work, we explore the use of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques to address these limitations, focusing on healthcare applications, particularly ICU vitals forecasting for sepsis patients. We introduce and evaluate two selective (BitFit and LayerNorm Tuning) and two additive (VeRA and FourierFT) PEFT techniques on multiple configurations of the Chronos TSFM for forecasting vital signs of sepsis patients. Our comparative analysis demonstrates that some of these PEFT methods outperform LoRA in terms of parameter efficiency and domain adaptation, establishing state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in ICU vital forecasting tasks. Interestingly, FourierFT applied to the Chronos (Tiny) variant surpasses the SOTA model while fine-tuning only 2,400 parameters compared to the 700K parameters of the benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages.

Instead, human evaluations that expand on traditional qualitative techniques from natural language generation literature are required. One recent best-practice consists in using A/B-testing frameworks, which capture preferences of human evaluators for specific models. In this paper we describe a human evaluation experiment focused on the biomedical domain (health, biology, chemistry/pharmacology) carried out at Elsevier. In it a large but not massive (8.8B parameter) decoder-only foundational transformer trained on a relatively small (135B tokens) but highly curated collection of Elsevier datasets is compared to OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo and Meta's foundational 7B parameter Llama 2 model against multiple criteria. Results indicate -- even if IRR scores were generally low -- a preference towards GPT-3.5-turbo, and hence towards models that possess conversational abilities, are very large and were trained on very large datasets. But at the same time, indicate that for less massive models training on smaller but well-curated training sets can potentially give rise to viable alternatives in the biomedical domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This document was submitted without obtaining all necessary permissions and therefore needs to be withdrawn.

These models use a masked prediction objective, where the model learns to predict information about masked input segments from the unmasked context. The choice of prediction targets in this framework can influence performance on downstream tasks. For example, targets that encode prosody are beneficial for speaker-related tasks, while targets that encode phonetics are more suited for content-related tasks. Additionally, prediction targets can vary in the level of detail they encode; targets that encode fine-grained acoustic details are beneficial for denoising tasks, while targets that encode higher-level abstractions are more suited for content-related tasks. Despite the importance of prediction targets, the design choices that affect them have not been thoroughly studied. This work explores the design choices and their impact on downstream task performance. Our results indicate that the commonly used design choices for HuBERT can be suboptimal. We propose novel approaches to create more informative prediction targets and demonstrate their effectiveness through improvements across various downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

Without an external intervention, often in terms of a high-level command, a low-level control policy cannot resolve such deadlocks. Utilizing the generalizability and low data requirements of foundation models, this paper explores the possibility of using text-based models, i.e., large language models (LLMs), and text-and-image-based models, i.e., vision-language models (VLMs), as high-level planners for deadlock resolution. We propose a hierarchical control framework where a foundation model-based high-level planner helps to resolve deadlocks by assigning a leader to the MRS along with a set of waypoints for the MRS leader. Then, a low-level distributed control policy based on graph neural networks is executed to safely follow these waypoints, thereby evading the deadlock. We conduct extensive experiments on various MRS environments using the best available pre-trained LLMs and VLMs. We compare their performance with a graph-based planner in terms of effectiveness in helping the MRS reach their target locations and computational time. Our results illustrate that, compared to grid-based planners, the foundation models perform better in terms of the goal-reaching rate and computational time for complex environments, which helps us conclude that foundation models can assist MRS operating in complex obstacle-cluttered environments to resolve deadlocks efficiently.</p></details> |  |

We hypothesize that LoRA, a parameter-efficient technique, can significantly accelerate the adaptation of large-scale EO models to this critical task while maintaining high performance. We apply LoRA to fine-tune a state-of-the-art EO foundation model pre-trained on diverse satellite imagery, using a curated dataset of flood events. Our results demonstrate that LoRA-based fine-tuning (r-256) improves F1 score by 6.66 points and IoU by 0.11 compared to a frozen encoder baseline, while significantly reducing computational costs. Notably, LoRA outperforms full fine-tuning, which proves computationally infeasible on our hardware. We further assess generalization through out-of-distribution (OOD) testing on a geographically distinct flood event. While LoRA configurations show improved OOD performance over the baseline. This work contributes to research on efficient adaptation of foundation models for specialized EO tasks, with implications for rapid response systems in disaster management. Our findings demonstrate LoRA's potential for enabling faster deployment of accurate flood segmentation models in resource-constrained, time-critical scenarios.</p></details> | 9 pages 2 figures |
| **[Estimating Wage Disparities Using Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09894v1)** | 2024-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One thread of empirical work in social science focuses on decomposing group differences in outcomes into unexplained components and components explained by observable factors. In this paper, we study gender wage decompositions, which require estimating the portion of the gender wage gap explained by career histories of workers. Classical methods for decomposing the wage gap employ simple predictive models of wages which condition on a small set of simple summaries of labor history. The problem is that these predictive models cannot take advantage of the full complexity of a worker's history, and the resulting decompositions thus suffer from omitted variable bias (OVB), where covariates that are correlated with both gender and wages are not included in the model. Here we explore an alternative methodology for wage gap decomposition that employs powerful foundation models, such as large language models, as the predictive engine. Foundation models excel at making accurate predictions from complex, high-dimensional inputs. We use a custom-built foundation model, designed to predict wages from full labor histories, to decompose the gender wage gap. We prove that the way such models are usually trained might still lead to OVB, but develop fine-tuning algorithms that empirically mitigate this issue. Our model captures a richer representation of career history than simple models and predicts wages more accurately. In detail, we first provide a novel set of conditions under which an estimator of the wage gap based on a fine-tuned foundation model is $\sqrt{n}$-consistent. Building on the theory, we then propose methods for fine-tuning foundation models that minimize OVB. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find that history explains more of the gender wage gap than standard econometric models can measure, and we identify elements of history that are important for reducing OVB.</p></details> |  |

Our method overcomes these limitations by incrementally building instance-level 3D scene representations using 2D foundation models, efficiently aggregating instance-level details such as masks, feature vectors, names, and captions. We introduce fusion schemes for feature vectors to enhance their contextual knowledge and performance on complex queries. Additionally, we explore large language models for robust automatic annotation and spatial reasoning tasks.

This shift involves moving away from specialized predictive models trained for specific, well-defined domain questions to generalist FMs pre-trained on vast amounts of unstructured data, which can then be adapted to various clinical tasks and questions. As a result, the standard data science workflow in medicine has been fundamentally altered; the foundation model lifecycle (FMLC) now includes distinct upstream and downstream processes, in which computational resources, model and data access, and decision-making power are distributed among multiple stakeholders. At their core, FMs are fundamentally statistical models, and this new workflow challenges the principles of Veridical Data Science (VDS), hindering the rigorous statistical analysis expected in transparent and scientifically reproducible data science practices. We critically examine the medical FMLC in light of the core principles of VDS: predictability, computability, and stability (PCS), and explain how it deviates from the standard data science workflow. Finally, we propose recommendations for a reimagined medical FMLC that expands and refines the PCS principles for VDS including considering the computational and accessibility constraints inherent to FMs.</p></details> |  |

These systems include shallow water equations and the Navier-Stokes equations with incompressible and compressible flow, regular and complex geometries, and different buoyancy settings. This work presents a new transformer-based multi-operator learning approach that fuses symbolic information to perform operator-based data prediction, i.e. non-autoregressive. By incorporating multiple modalities in the inputs, the PDE foundation model builds in a pathway for including mathematical descriptions of the physical behavior. We pre-train our foundation model on 6 parametric families of equations collected from 13 datasets, including over 60K trajectories.

| **[A Survey of Foundation Models for Music Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09601v1)** | 2024-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Music is essential in daily life, fulfilling emotional and entertainment needs, and connecting us personally, socially, and culturally. A better understanding of music can enhance our emotions, cognitive skills, and cultural connections. The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced new ways to analyze music, aiming to replicate human understanding of music and provide related services. While the traditional models focused on audio features and simple tasks, the recent development of large language models (LLMs) and foundation models (FMs), which excel in various fields by integrating semantic information and demonstrating strong reasoning abilities, could capture complex musical features and patterns, integrate music with language and incorporate rich musical, emotional and psychological knowledge. Therefore, they have the potential in handling complex music understanding tasks from a semantic perspective, producing outputs closer to human perception. This work, to our best knowledge, is one of the early reviews of the intersection of AI techniques and music understanding. We investigated, analyzed, and tested recent large-scale music foundation models in respect of their music comprehension abilities. We also discussed their limitations and proposed possible future directions, offering insights for researchers in this field.</p></details> | 20 pages, 2 figures |

FMs overcome the limitations of existing deep learning approaches in CPath by learning a representation space that can be adapted to a wide variety of downstream tasks without explicit supervision. VLMs allow pathology reports written in natural language to be used as a rich semantic information source to improve existing models as well as generate predictions in natural language form. In this survey, a holistic and systematic overview of recent innovations in FMs and VLMs in CPath is presented. Furthermore, the tools, datasets and training schemes for these models are summarized in addition to categorizing them into distinct groups. This extensive survey highlights the current trends in CPath and the way it is going to be transformed through FMs and VLMs in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 19 figures and 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[COMFORT: A Continual Fine-Tuning Framework for Foundation Models Targeted at Consumer Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09549v1)** | 2024-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wearable medical sensors (WMSs) are revolutionizing smart healthcare by enabling continuous, real-time monitoring of user physiological signals, especially in the field of consumer healthcare. The integration of WMSs and modern machine learning (ML) enables unprecedented solutions to efficient early-stage disease detection. Despite the success of Transformers in various fields, their application to sensitive domains, such as smart healthcare, remains underexplored due to limited data accessibility and privacy concerns. To bridge the gap between Transformer-based foundation models and WMS-based disease detection, we propose COMFORT, a continual fine-tuning framework for foundation models targeted at consumer healthcare. COMFORT introduces a novel approach for pre-training a Transformer-based foundation model on a large dataset of physiological signals exclusively collected from healthy individuals with commercially available WMSs. We adopt a masked data modeling (MDM) objective to pre-train this health foundation model. We then fine-tune the model using various parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and its variants, to adapt it to various downstream disease detection tasks that rely on WMS data. In addition, COMFORT continually stores the low-rank decomposition matrices obtained from the PEFT algorithms to construct a library for multi-disease detection. The COMFORT library enables scalable and memory-efficient disease detection on edge devices. Our experimental results demonstrate that COMFORT achieves highly competitive performance while reducing memory overhead by up to 52% relative to conventional methods. Thus, COMFORT paves the way for personalized and proactive solutions to efficient and effective early-stage disease detection for consumer healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 10 figures.

However, it remains an open question on how to design an infrared foundation model. In this paper, we propose InfMAE, a foundation model in infrared modality. We release an infrared dataset, called Inf30 to address the problem of lacking large-scale data for self-supervised learning in the infrared vision community. Besides, we design an information-aware masking strategy, which is suitable for infrared images. This masking strategy allows for a greater emphasis on the regions with richer information in infrared images during the self-supervised learning process, which is conducive to learning the generalized representation. In addition, we adopt a multi-scale encoder to enhance the performance of the pre-trained encoders in downstream tasks. Finally, based on the fact that infrared images do not have a lot of details and texture information, we design an infrared decoder module, which further improves the performance of downstream tasks. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method InfMAE outperforms other supervised methods and self-supervised learning methods in three downstream tasks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 figures |
| **[On the Generalizability of Foundation Models for Crop Type Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09451v1)** | 2024-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pre-trained using self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning have shown powerful transfer learning capabilities on various downstream tasks, including language understanding, text generation, and image recognition. Recently, the Earth observation (EO) field has produced several foundation models pre-trained directly on multispectral satellite imagery (e.g., Sentinel-2) for applications like precision agriculture, wildfire and drought monitoring, and natural disaster response. However, few studies have investigated the ability of these models to generalize to new geographic locations, and potential concerns of geospatial bias -- models trained on data-rich developed countries not transferring well to data-scarce developing countries -- remain. We investigate the ability of popular EO foundation models to transfer to new geographic regions in the agricultural domain, where differences in farming practices and class imbalance make transfer learning particularly challenging. We first select six crop classification datasets across five continents, normalizing for dataset size and harmonizing classes to focus on four major cereal grains: maize, soybean, rice, and wheat. We then compare three popular foundation models, pre-trained on SSL4EO-S12, SatlasPretrain, and ImageNet, using in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluation. Experiments show that pre-trained weights designed explicitly for Sentinel-2, such as SSL4EO-S12, outperform general pre-trained weights like ImageNet. Furthermore, the benefits of pre-training on OOD data are the most significant when only 10--100 ID training samples are used. Transfer learning and pre-training with OOD and limited ID data show promising applications, as many developing regions have scarce crop type labels. All harmonized datasets and experimental code are open-source and available for download.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks and Foundation Models as Feature Extractors for Content-based Medical Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09430v1)** | 2024-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image retrieval refers to the task of finding similar images for given query images in a database, with applications such as diagnosis support, treatment planning, and educational tools for inexperienced medical practitioners. While traditional medical image retrieval was performed using clinical metadata, content-based medical image retrieval (CBMIR) relies on the characteristic features of the images, such as color, texture, shape, and spatial features. Many approaches have been proposed for CBMIR, and among them, using pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is a widely utilized approach. However, considering the recent advances in the development of foundation models for various computer vision tasks, their application for CBMIR can be also investigated for its potentially superior performance. In this study, we used several pre-trained feature extractors from well-known pre-trained CNNs (VGG19, ResNet-50, DenseNet121, and EfficientNetV2M) and pre-trained foundation models (MedCLIP, BioMedCLIP, OpenCLIP, CONCH and UNI) and investigated the CBMIR performance on a subset of the MedMNIST V2 dataset, including eight types of 2D and 3D medical images. Furthermore, we also investigated the effect of image size on the CBMIR performance. Our results show that, overall, for the 2D datasets, foundation models deliver superior performance by a large margin compared to CNNs, with UNI providing the best overall performance across all datasets and image sizes. For 3D datasets, CNNs and foundation models deliver more competitive performance, with CONCH achieving the best overall performance. Moreover, our findings confirm that while using larger image sizes (especially for 2D datasets) yields slightly better performance, competitive CBMIR performance can still be achieved even with smaller image sizes. Our codes to generate and reproduce the results are available on GitHub.</p></details> | 29 pages |

As the idea of AI-generated or AI-augmented music becomes more mainstream, many researchers in the music AI community may be wondering what avenues of research are left. With regards to music generative models, we outline the current areas of research with significant room for exploration. Firstly, we pose the question of foundational representation of these generative models and investigate approaches towards explainability. Next, we discuss the current state of music datasets and their limitations. We then overview different generative models, forms of evaluating these models, and their computational constraints/limitations. Subsequently, we highlight applications of these generative models towards extensions to multiple modalities and integration with artists' workflow as well as music education systems. Finally, we survey the potential copyright implications of generative music and discuss strategies for protecting the rights of musicians. While it is not meant to be exhaustive, our survey calls to attention a variety of research directions enabled by music foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating General Purpose Vision Foundation Models for Medical Image Analysis: An Experimental Study of DINOv2 on Radiology Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02366v4)** | 2024-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of deep learning systems into healthcare has been hindered by the resource-intensive process of data annotation and the inability of these systems to generalize to different data distributions. Foundation models, which are models pre-trained on large datasets, have emerged as a solution to reduce reliance on annotated data and enhance model generalizability and robustness. DINOv2 is an open-source foundation model pre-trained with self-supervised learning on 142 million curated natural images that exhibits promising capabilities across various vision tasks. Nevertheless, a critical question remains unanswered regarding DINOv2's adaptability to radiological imaging, and whether its features are sufficiently general to benefit radiology image analysis. Therefore, this study comprehensively evaluates the performance DINOv2 for radiology, conducting over 200 evaluations across diverse modalities (X-ray, CT, and MRI). To measure the effectiveness and generalizability of DINOv2's feature representations, we analyze the model across medical image analysis tasks including disease classification and organ segmentation on both 2D and 3D images, and under different settings like kNN, few-shot learning, linear-probing, end-to-end fine-tuning, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Comparative analyses with established supervised, self-supervised, and weakly-supervised models reveal DINOv2's superior performance and cross-task generalizability. The findings contribute insights to potential avenues for optimizing pre-training strategies for medical imaging and enhancing the broader understanding of DINOv2's role in bridging the gap between natural and radiological image analysis.

| **[Leveraging Foundation Models for Efficient Federated Learning in Resource-restricted Edge Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09273v1)** | 2024-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently pre-trained Foundation Models (FMs) have been combined with Federated Learning (FL) to improve training of downstream tasks while preserving privacy. However, deploying FMs over edge networks with resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices is under-explored. This paper proposes a novel framework, namely, Federated Distilling knowledge to Prompt (FedD2P), for leveraging the robust representation abilities of a vision-language FM without deploying it locally on edge devices. This framework distills the aggregated knowledge of IoT devices to a prompt generator to efficiently adapt the frozen FM for downstream tasks. To eliminate the dependency on a public dataset, our framework leverages perclass local knowledge from IoT devices and linguistic descriptions of classes to train the prompt generator. Our experiments on diverse image classification datasets CIFAR, OxfordPets, SVHN, EuroSAT, and DTD show that FedD2P outperforms the baselines in terms of model performance.</p></details> |  |

Existing deep learning methods show promise but lack support for multi-modal inputs and struggle to generalize to different geobody types or surveys. We introduce a promptable foundation model for interpreting any geobodies across seismic surveys. This model integrates a pre-trained vision foundation model (VFM) with a sophisticated multi-modal prompt engine. The VFM, pre-trained on massive natural images and fine-tuned on seismic data, provides robust feature extraction for cross-survey generalization. The prompt engine incorporates multi-modal prior information to iteratively refine geobody delineation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the model's superior accuracy, scalability from 2D to 3D, and generalizability to various geobody types, including those unseen during training. To our knowledge, this is the first highly scalable and versatile multi-modal foundation model capable of interpreting any geobodies across surveys while supporting real-time interactions. Our approach establishes a new paradigm for geoscientific data interpretation, with broad potential for transfer to other tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Eureka: Evaluating and Understanding Large Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10566v1)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rigorous and reproducible evaluation is critical for assessing the state of the art and for guiding scientific advances in Artificial Intelligence. Evaluation is challenging in practice due to several reasons, including benchmark saturation, lack of transparency in methods used for measurement, development challenges in extracting measurements for generative tasks, and, more generally, the extensive number of capabilities required for a well-rounded comparison across models. We make three contributions to alleviate the above challenges. First, we present Eureka, an open-source framework for standardizing evaluations of large foundation models beyond single-score reporting and rankings. Second, we introduce Eureka-Bench as an extensible collection of benchmarks testing capabilities that (i) are still challenging for state-of-the-art models and (ii) represent fundamental but overlooked language and multimodal capabilities. The inherent space for improvement in non-saturated benchmarks enables us to discover meaningful differences between models at a capability level. Third, using Eureka, we conduct an analysis of 12 state-of-the-art models, providing in-depth insights into failure understanding and model comparison, which can be leveraged to plan targeted improvements. In contrast to recent trends in reports and leaderboards showing absolute rankings and claims for one model or another to be the best, our analysis shows that there is no such best model. Different models have different strengths, but there are models that appear more often than others as best performers for some capabilities. Despite the recent improvements, current models still struggle with several fundamental capabilities including detailed image understanding, benefiting from multimodal input when available rather than fully relying on language, factuality and grounding for information retrieval, and over refusals.</p></details> |  |

We even observe an incursion of these models into disciplines related to human psychology, such as the Affective Computing domain, suggesting their affective, emerging capabilities. In this work, we aim to raise awareness of the power of Foundation Models in the field of Affective Computing by synthetically generating and analysing multimodal affective data, focusing on vision, linguistics, and speech (acoustics). We also discuss some fundamental problems, such as ethical issues and regulatory aspects, related to the use of Foundation Models in this research area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty and Generalizability in Foundation Models for Earth Observation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08744v1)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We take the perspective in which we want to design a downstream task (such as estimating vegetation coverage) on a certain area of interest (AOI) with a limited labeling budget. By leveraging an existing Foundation Model (FM) we must decide whether we train a downstream model on a different but label-rich AOI hoping it generalizes to our AOI, or we split labels in our AOI for training and validating. In either case, we face choices concerning what FM to use, how to sample our AOI for labeling, etc. which affect both the performance and uncertainty of the results. In this work, we perform a large ablative study using eight existing FMs on either Sentinel 1 or Sentinel 2 as input data, and the classes from the ESA World Cover product as downstream tasks across eleven AOIs. We do repeated sampling and training, resulting in an ablation of some 500K simple linear regression models. Our results show both the limits of spatial generalizability across AOIs and the power of FMs where we are able to get over 0.9 correlation coefficient between predictions and targets on different chip level predictive tasks. And still, performance and uncertainty vary greatly across AOIs, tasks and FMs. We believe this is a key issue in practice, because there are many design decisions behind each FM and downstream task (input modalities, sampling, architectures, pretraining, etc.) and usually a downstream task designer is aware of and can decide upon a few of them. Through this work, we advocate for the usage of the methodology herein described (large ablations on reference global labels and simple probes), both when publishing new FMs, and to make informed decisions when designing downstream tasks to use them.</p></details> | <details><summary>A lar...</summary><p>A large ablation study measuring uncertainty and spatial generalizability with 8 foundation models, 11 world regions and 7 downstream tasks</p></details> |

However, these claims have not been thoroughly analyzed yet. Recently, foundation models have demonstrated unparalleled capabilities across diverse domains from language to computer vision, marking them as a potential cornerstone of future research for a multitude of computational tasks. In this paper, we conduct an extensive empirical study on representation learning for downstream Visual Question Answering (VQA), which requires an accurate compositional understanding of the scene. We thoroughly investigate the benefits and trade-offs of OC models and alternative approaches including large pre-trained foundation models on both synthetic and real-world data, and demonstrate a viable way to achieve the best of both worlds. The extensiveness of our study, encompassing over 800 downstream VQA models and 15 different types of upstream representations, also provides several additional insights that we believe will be of interest to the community at large.</p></details> |  |
| **[Annotation Free Semantic Segmentation with Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09307v3)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic Segmentation is one of the most challenging vision tasks, usually requiring large amounts of training data with expensive pixel level annotations. With the success of foundation models and especially vision-language models, recent works attempt to achieve zeroshot semantic segmentation while requiring either large-scale training or additional image/pixel level annotations. In this work, we generate free annotations for any semantic segmentation dataset using existing foundation models. We use CLIP to detect objects and SAM to generate high quality object masks. Next, we build a lightweight module on top of a self-supervised vision encoder, DinoV2, to align the patch features with a pretrained text encoder for zeroshot semantic segmentation. Our approach can bring language-based semantics to any pretrained vision encoder with minimal training, uses foundation models as the sole source of supervision and generalizes from little training data with no annotation.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art methods typically employ fully supervised approaches, necessitating a huge labeled dataset acquired through expensive LiDAR sensors and meticulous voxel-wise labeling by human annotators. The resource-intensive nature of this annotating process significantly hampers the application and scalability of these methods. We introduce a novel semi-supervised framework to alleviate the dependency on densely annotated data. Our approach leverages 2D foundation models to generate essential 3D scene geometric and semantic cues, facilitating a more efficient training process. Our framework exhibits notable properties: (1) Generalizability, applicable to various 3D semantic scene completion approaches, including 2D-3D lifting and 3D-2D transformer methods. (2) Effectiveness, as demonstrated through experiments on SemanticKITTI and NYUv2, wherein our method achieves up to 85% of the fully-supervised performance using only 10% labeled data. This approach not only reduces the cost and labor associated with data annotation but also demonstrates the potential for broader adoption in camera-based systems for 3D semantic occupancy prediction.</p></details> |  |

A potential application of such models is in computer network traffic analysis, where these models can grasp the complexities of network traffic dynamics and adapt to any specific task or network environment with minimal fine-tuning. Previous approaches have used tokenized hex-level packet data and the model architecture of large language transformer models. We propose a new, efficient graph-based alternative at the flow-level. Our approach represents network traffic as a dynamic spatio-temporal graph, employing a self-supervised link prediction pretraining task to capture the spatial and temporal dynamics in this network graph framework. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct a few-shot learning experiment for three distinct downstream network tasks: intrusion detection, traffic classification, and botnet classification. Models finetuned from our pretrained base achieve an average performance increase of 6.87\% over training from scratch, demonstrating their ability to effectively learn general network traffic dynamics during pretraining. This success suggests the potential for a large-scale version to serve as an operational foundational model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print of Accepted Workshop paper to 3rd GNNet, co-located with CoNEXT'24</p></details> |

However, it is extremely challenging for sensors in many different fields to collect similar scales of natural images to train strong foundation models. To this end, this work presents a simple and effective framework SimMAT to study an open problem: the transferability from vision foundation models trained on natural RGB images to other image modalities of different physical properties (e.g., polarization). SimMAT consists of a modality-agnostic transfer layer (MAT) and a pretrained foundation model. We apply SimMAT to a representative vision foundation model Segment Anything Model (SAM) to support any evaluated new image modality. Given the absence of relevant benchmarks, we construct a new benchmark to evaluate the transfer learning performance. Our experiments confirm the intriguing potential of transferring vision foundation models in enhancing other sensors' performance. Specifically, SimMAT can improve the segmentation performance (mIoU) from 22.15% to 53.88% on average for evaluated modalities and consistently outperforms other baselines. We hope that SimMAT can raise awareness of cross-modal transfer learning and benefit various fields for better results with vision foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github link: https://github.com/mt-cly/SimMAT</p></details> |

However, their performance drops significantly under domain (covariate) shift, a prevalent issue in medical image segmentation due to varying acquisition settings across different scanner models and protocols. Recently, foundational models (FMs) trained on large datasets have gained attention for their ability to be adapted for downstream tasks and achieve state-of-the-art performance with excellent generalization capabilities on natural images. However, their effectiveness in medical image segmentation remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the domain generalization performance of various FMs, including DinoV2, SAM, MedSAM, and MAE, when fine-tuned using various parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques such as Ladder and Rein (+LoRA) and decoder heads. We introduce a novel decode head architecture, HQHSAM, which simply integrates elements from two state-of-the-art decoder heads, HSAM and HQSAM, to enhance segmentation performance. Our extensive experiments on multiple datasets, encompassing various anatomies and modalities, reveal that FMs, particularly with the HQHSAM decode head, improve domain generalization for medical image segmentation. Moreover, we found that the effectiveness of PEFT techniques varies across different FMs. These findings underscore the potential of FMs to enhance the domain generalization performance of neural networks in medical image segmentation across diverse clinical settings, providing a solid foundation for future research.

Abnormal patterns of neural signaling often indicate the presence of underlying brain diseases. The variability among individuals, the diverse array of clinical symptoms from various brain disorders, and the limited availability of diagnostic classifications, have posed significant barriers to formulating reliable model of neural signals for diverse application contexts. Here, we present BrainWave, the first foundation model for both invasive and non-invasive neural recordings, pretrained on more than 40,000 hours of electrical brain recordings (13.79 TB of data) from approximately 16,000 individuals. Our analysis show that BrainWave outperforms all other competing models and consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in the diagnosis and identification of neurological disorders. We also demonstrate robust capabilities of BrainWave in enabling zero-shot transfer learning across varying recording conditions and brain diseases, as well as few-shot classification without fine-tuning, suggesting that BrainWave learns highly generalizable representations of neural signals. We hence believe that open-sourcing BrainWave will facilitate a wide range of clinical applications in medicine, paving the way for AI-driven approaches to investigate brain disorders and advance neuroscience research.</p></details> | 39 pages, 14 figures |

Often, these intermediate features require further fine-tuning or processing with additional neural network layers to align the final similarity scores with human judgments. So far, most IQA models based on foundation models have primarily relied on the final layer or the embedding for the quality score estimation. In contrast, this work explores the potential of utilizing the intermediate features of these foundation models, which have largely been unexplored so far in the design of low-level perceptual similarity metrics. We demonstrate that the intermediate features are comparatively more effective. Moreover, without requiring any training, these metrics can outperform both traditional and state-of-the-art learned metrics by utilizing distance measures between the features.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/abhijay9/ZS-IQA</p></details> |

It examines the characteristics of FMs, including their training on vast datasets and use of embedding spaces to capture semantic relationships. The paper discusses recent advancements in FMs' reasoning abilities which we argue cannot be attributed to increased model size but to novel training techniques which yield learning phenomena like grokking. It also addresses the challenges in benchmarking FMs and compares their structure to the human brain. We argue that while FMs show promising developments in reasoning and knowledge representation, understanding their inner workings remains a significant challenge, similar to ongoing efforts in neuroscience to comprehend human brain function.

While artificial intelligence (AI) foundation models hold significant promise for addressing these challenges, existing ophthalmic foundation models primarily focus on a single modality, whereas diagnosing eye diseases requires multiple modalities. A critical yet often overlooked aspect is harnessing the multi-view information across various modalities for the same patient. Additionally, due to the long-tail nature of ophthalmic diseases, standard fully supervised or unsupervised learning approaches often struggle. Therefore, it is essential to integrate clinical text to capture a broader spectrum of diseases. We propose EyeCLIP, a visual-language foundation model developed using over 2.77 million multi-modal ophthalmology images with partial text data. To fully leverage the large multi-modal unlabeled and labeled data, we introduced a pretraining strategy that combines self-supervised reconstructions, multi-modal image contrastive learning, and image-text contrastive learning to learn a shared representation of multiple modalities. Through evaluation using 14 benchmark datasets, EyeCLIP can be transferred to a wide range of downstream tasks involving ocular and systemic diseases, achieving state-of-the-art performance in disease classification, visual question answering, and cross-modal retrieval. EyeCLIP represents a significant advancement over previous methods, especially showcasing few-shot, even zero-shot capabilities in real-world long-tail scenarios.</p></details> |  |

We collected data from 18 researchers with an interface that we designed using network simplification methods and analyzed how users browsed and identified important papers. Our analysis reveals six major patterns used for identifying papers of interest, which can be categorized into three key components: Fields, Bridges, and Foundations, each viewed from two distinct perspectives: layout-oriented and connection-oriented. The connection-oriented approach was found to be more reliable for selecting relevant papers, but the layout-oriented method was adopted more often, even though it led to unexpected results and user frustration. Our findings emphasize the importance of integrating these components and the necessity to balance visual layouts with meaningful connections to enhance the effectiveness of citation networks in academic browsing systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-Performance Few-Shot Segmentation with Foundation Models: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06305v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing few-shot segmentation (FSS) methods mainly focus on designing novel support-query matching and self-matching mechanisms to exploit implicit knowledge in pre-trained backbones. However, the performance of these methods is often constrained by models pre-trained on classification tasks. The exploration of what types of pre-trained models can provide more beneficial implicit knowledge for FSS remains limited. In this paper, inspired by the representation consistency of foundational computer vision models, we develop a FSS framework based on foundation models. To be specific, we propose a simple approach to extract implicit knowledge from foundation models to construct coarse correspondence and introduce a lightweight decoder to refine coarse correspondence for fine-grained segmentation. We systematically summarize the performance of various foundation models on FSS and discover that the implicit knowledge within some of these models is more beneficial for FSS than models pre-trained on classification tasks. Extensive experiments on two widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in leveraging the implicit knowledge of foundation models. Notably, the combination of DINOv2 and DFN exceeds previous state-of-the-art methods by 17.5% on COCO-20i.

| **[ProteinBench: A Holistic Evaluation of Protein Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06744v1)** | 2024-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed a surge in the development of protein foundation models, significantly improving performance in protein prediction and generative tasks ranging from 3D structure prediction and protein design to conformational dynamics. However, the capabilities and limitations associated with these models remain poorly understood due to the absence of a unified evaluation framework. To fill this gap, we introduce ProteinBench, a holistic evaluation framework designed to enhance the transparency of protein foundation models. Our approach consists of three key components: (i) A taxonomic classification of tasks that broadly encompass the main challenges in the protein domain, based on the relationships between different protein modalities; (ii) A multi-metric evaluation approach that assesses performance across four key dimensions: quality, novelty, diversity, and robustness; and (iii) In-depth analyses from various user objectives, providing a holistic view of model performance. Our comprehensive evaluation of protein foundation models reveals several key findings that shed light on their current capabilities and limitations. To promote transparency and facilitate further research, we release the evaluation dataset, code, and a public leaderboard publicly for further analysis and a general modular toolkit. We intend for ProteinBench to be a living benchmark for establishing a standardized, in-depth evaluation framework for protein foundation models, driving their development and application while fostering collaboration within the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 1 figure and 11 tables</p></details> |

This review not only highlights the key advantages of GFMs, but also presents essential techniques for their construction, with a focus on transformers, pre-training, and adaptation strategies. Subsequently, we examine recent advancements in GFMs, including large language models, vision models, and vision-language models, particularly emphasizing the potential applications in remote sensing. Additionally, the review concludes with a comprehensive analysis of the challenges and future trends in GFMs, addressing five critical aspects: data integration, model complexity, uncertainty quantification, interdisciplinary collaboration, and concerns related to privacy, trust, and security. This review offers a comprehensive overview of emerging geoscientific research paradigms, emphasizing the untapped opportunities at the intersection of advanced AI techniques and geoscience.

| **[A Comprehensive Evaluation of Histopathology Foundation Models for Ovarian Cancer Subtype Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09990v2)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pretrained transformers are increasingly being developed as generalised foundation models which can underpin powerful task-specific artificial intelligence models. Histopathology foundation models show great promise across many tasks, but analyses have typically been limited by arbitrary hyperparameters that were not tuned to the specific task. We report the most rigorous single-task validation of histopathology foundation models to date, specifically in ovarian cancer morphological subtyping. Attention-based multiple instance learning classifiers were compared using three ImageNet-pretrained feature extractors and fourteen histopathology foundation models. The training set consisted of 1864 whole slide images from 434 ovarian carcinoma cases at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. Five-class classification performance was evaluated through five-fold cross-validation, and these cross-validation models were ensembled for hold-out testing and external validation on the Transcanadian Study and OCEAN Challenge datasets. The best-performing model used the H-optimus-0 foundation model, with five-class balanced accuracies of 89%, 97%, and 74% in the test sets. Normalisations and augmentations aided the performance of the ImageNet-pretrained ResNets, but these were still outperformed by 13 of the 14 foundation models. Hyperparameter tuning the downstream classifiers improved performance by a median 1.9% balanced accuracy, with many improvements being statistically significant. Histopathology foundation models offer a clear benefit to ovarian cancer subtyping, improving classification performance to a degree where clinical utility is tangible, albeit with an increased computational burden. Such models could provide a second opinion to histopathologists diagnosing challenging cases and may improve the accuracy, objectivity, and efficiency of pathological diagnoses overall.</p></details> |  |

F-SEG allows the use of pre-trained deep neural networks, including recently developed pathology foundation models, for semantic segmentation. It achieves this without requiring additional training or finetuning, by factorizing the spatial features extracted by the models into segmentation masks and their associated concept features. We create generic tissue phenotypes for H&E images by training clustering models for multiple numbers of clusters on features extracted from several deep learning models on The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA), and then show how the clusters can be used for factorizing corresponding segmentation masks using off-the-shelf deep learning models. Our results show that F-SEG provides robust unsupervised segmentation capabilities for H&E pathology images, and that the segmentation quality is greatly improved by utilizing pathology foundation models. We discuss and propose methods for evaluating the performance of unsupervised segmentation in pathology.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by recent advancements in text-to-image generative models, such as Stable Diffusion, we study the potential of generative models trained on large-scale open-set data to synthesize OOD samples, thereby enhancing OOD object detection. We introduce SyncOOD, a simple data curation method that capitalizes on the capabilities of large foundation models to automatically extract meaningful OOD data from text-to-image generative models. This offers the model access to open-world knowledge encapsulated within off-the-shelf foundation models. The synthetic OOD samples are then employed to augment the training of a lightweight, plug-and-play OOD detector, thus effectively optimizing the in-distribution (ID)/OOD decision boundaries. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SyncOOD significantly outperforms existing methods, establishing new state-of-the-art performance with minimal synthetic data usage.</p></details> | 19 pages, 4 figures |

The successful development of such general-purpose models for physics data would be a major breakthrough as they could improve the achievable physics performance while at the same time drastically reduce the required amount of training time and data. We report significant progress on this challenge on several fronts. First, a comprehensive set of evaluation methods is introduced to judge the quality of an encoding from physics data into a representation suitable for the autoregressive generation of particle jets with transformer architectures (the common backbone of foundation models). These measures motivate the choice of a higher-fidelity tokenization compared to previous works. Finally, we demonstrate transfer learning between an unsupervised problem (jet generation) and a classic supervised task (jet tagging) with our new OmniJet-$\alpha$ model. This is the first successful transfer between two different and actively studied classes of tasks and constitutes a major step in the building of foundation models for particle physics.</p></details> |  |

Traditional visual language models (VLMs) use separate modules for understanding and generating visual content, which can lead to misalignment and increased complexity. In contrast, VILA-U employs a single autoregressive next-token prediction framework for both tasks, eliminating the need for additional components like diffusion models. This approach not only simplifies the model but also achieves near state-of-the-art performance in visual language understanding and generation. The success of VILA-U is attributed to two main factors: the unified vision tower that aligns discrete visual tokens with textual inputs during pretraining, which enhances visual perception, and autoregressive image generation can achieve similar quality as diffusion models with high-quality dataset. This allows VILA-U to perform comparably to more complex models using a fully token-based autoregressive framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

However, accessing patient data can be challenging due to privacy concerns and strict regulations. Generating synthetic, realistic data offers a potential solution for overcoming these limitations, and recent studies suggest that fine-tuning foundation models can produce such data effectively. In this study, we explore the potential of foundation models for generating realistic medical images, particularly chest x-rays, and assess how their performance improves with fine-tuning. We propose using a Latent Diffusion Model, starting with a pre-trained foundation model and refining it through various configurations. Additionally, we performed experiments with input from a medical professional to assess the realism of the images produced by each trained model.</p></details> |  |

This process, known as the customization of domain-specific foundation models, addresses the limitations of general-purpose models, which may not fully capture the unique patterns and requirements of domain-specific data. Despite its importance, there is a notable lack of comprehensive overview papers on building domain-specific foundation models, while numerous resources exist for general-purpose models. To bridge this gap, this article provides a timely and thorough overview of the methodology for customizing domain-specific foundation models. It introduces basic concepts, outlines the general architecture, and surveys key methods for constructing domain-specific models. Furthermore, the article discusses various domains that can benefit from these specialized models and highlights the challenges ahead. Through this overview, we aim to offer valuable guidance and reference for researchers and practitioners from diverse fields to develop their own customized foundation models.</p></details> |  |

However, new approaches to FL often discuss their contributions involving small deep-learning models only and focus on training full models on clients. In the wake of Foundation Models (FM), the reality is different for many deep learning applications. Typically, FMs have already been pre-trained across a wide variety of tasks and can be fine-tuned to specific downstream tasks over significantly smaller datasets than required for full model training. However, access to such datasets is often challenging. By its design, FL can help to open data silos. With this survey, we introduce a novel taxonomy focused on computational and communication efficiency, the vital elements to make use of FMs in FL systems. We discuss the benefits and drawbacks of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for FL applications, elaborate on the readiness of FL frameworks to work with FMs, and provide future research opportunities on how to evaluate generative models in FL as well as the interplay of privacy and PEFT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at IJCAI 2024.

However, the optimal scene encoding strategies for various scenarios remain unclear, particularly compared to their image-based counterparts. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive study that probes various visual encoding models for 3D scene understanding, identifying the strengths and limitations of each model across different scenarios. Our evaluation spans seven vision foundation encoders, including image-based, video-based, and 3D foundation models. We evaluate these models in four tasks: Vision-Language Scene Reasoning, Visual Grounding, Segmentation, and Registration, each focusing on different aspects of scene understanding. Our evaluations yield key findings: DINOv2 demonstrates superior performance, video models excel in object-level tasks, diffusion models benefit geometric tasks, and language-pretrained models show unexpected limitations in language-related tasks. These insights challenge some conventional understandings, provide novel perspectives on leveraging visual foundation models, and highlight the need for more flexible encoder selection in future vision-language and scene-understanding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://yunzeman.github.io/lexicon3d , Github: https://github.com/YunzeMan/Lexicon3D</p></details> |

Building on the success of powerful vision-language (ViL) foundation models, such as CLIP, recent efforts sought to harness their zero-short capabilities to recognize unseen categories. Despite notable performance improvements, these models still encounter the critical issue of generating precise mask proposals for unseen categories and scenarios, resulting in inferior segmentation performance eventually. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel approach, FrozenSeg, designed to integrate spatial knowledge from a localization foundation model (e.g., SAM) and semantic knowledge extracted from a ViL model (e.g., CLIP), in a synergistic framework. Taking the ViL model's visual encoder as the feature backbone, we inject the space-aware feature into the learnable queries and CLIP features within the transformer decoder. In addition, we devise a mask proposal ensemble strategy for further improving the recall rate and mask quality. To fully exploit pre-trained knowledge while minimizing training overhead, we freeze both foundation models, focusing optimization efforts solely on a lightweight transformer decoder for mask proposal generation-the performance bottleneck. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FrozenSeg advances state-of-the-art results across various segmentation benchmarks, trained exclusively on COCO panoptic data, and tested in a zero-shot manner. Code is available at https://github.com/chenxi52/FrozenSeg.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

Foundation models have the potential to improve generalizability within and across centers and serve as starting points for data efficient development of specialized yet robust AI models. However, the training foundation models themselves is usually very expensive in terms of data, computation, and time. This paper proposes a supervised training method that drastically reduces these expenses. The proposed method is based on multi-task learning to train a joint encoder, by combining 16 different classification, segmentation, and detection tasks on a total of 912,000 patches. Since the encoder is capable of capturing the properties of the samples, we term it the Tissue Concepts encoder. To evaluate the performance and generalizability of the Tissue Concepts encoder across centers, classification of whole slide images from four of the most prevalent solid cancers - breast, colon, lung, and prostate - was used. The experiments show that the Tissue Concepts model achieve comparable performance to models trained with self-supervision, while requiring only 6% of the amount of training patches. Furthermore, the Tissue Concepts encoder outperforms an ImageNet pre-trained encoder on both in-domain and out-of-domain data.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 Pa...</summary><p>22 Pages, 3 Figures, submitted to and under revision at Computers in Biology and Medicine</p></details> |

While recent advancements in machine learning have enabled models to generalize across new tasks and environments, the challenge of adapting these models to entirely new settings remains largely unexplored. This study addresses this by investigating the generalization capabilities of the RT-1-X robotic foundation model to a type of robot unseen during its training: a SCARA robot from UMI-RTX. Initial experiments reveal that RT-1-X does not generalize zero-shot to the unseen type of robot. However, fine-tuning of the RT-1-X model by demonstration allows the robot to learn a pickup task which was part of the foundation model (but learned for another type of robot). When the robot is presented with an object that is included in the foundation model but not in the fine-tuning dataset, it demonstrates that only the skill, but not the object-specific knowledge, has been transferred.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, submitted to the joint Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning conference for Belgium, Netherlands & Luxembourg (BNAIC/BeNeLearn)</p></details> |

The framework comprises three parts: data processing, foundation system, and downstream applications. First, we comprehensively present our data processing pipeline, which transforms massive raw audio into a large-scale high-quality TTS dataset with rich annotations and a wide coverage of content, speaking style, and timbre. Then, we propose a language-model-based foundation TTS system. The speech signal is compressed into discrete semantic tokens via a semantic-aware speech tokenizer, and can be generated by a language model from the prompt text and audio. Then, a two-stage waveform generator is proposed to decode them to the high-fidelity waveform. We present two applications of this system: voice cloning for dubbing and human-like speech generation for chatbots. The experimental results demonstrate the solid in-context learning capability of FireRedTTS, which can stably synthesize high-quality speech consistent with the prompt text and audio. For dubbing, FireRedTTS can clone target voices in a zero-shot way for the UGC scenario and adapt to studio-level expressive voice characters in the PUGC scenario via few-shot fine-tuning with 1-hour recording. Moreover, FireRedTTS achieves controllable human-like speech generation in a casual style with paralinguistic behaviors and emotions via instruction tuning, to better serve spoken chatbots.</p></details> |  |

This survey presents a comprehensive review of more than 40 research papers, demonstrating the role of foundation models in enhancing AD. Large language models contribute to planning and simulation in AD, particularly through their proficiency in reasoning, code generation and translation. In parallel, vision foundation models are increasingly adapted for critical tasks such as 3D object detection and tracking, as well as creating realistic driving scenarios for simulation and testing. Multi-modal foundation models, integrating diverse inputs, exhibit exceptional visual understanding and spatial reasoning, crucial for end-to-end AD. This survey not only provides a structured taxonomy, categorizing foundation models based on their modalities and functionalities within the AD domain but also delves into the methods employed in current research. It identifies the gaps between existing foundation models and cutting-edge AD approaches, thereby charting future research directions and proposing a roadmap for bridging these gaps.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient Instance Segmentation Framework Using Segmentation Foundation Models with Oriented Bounding Box Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08174v5)** | 2024-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instance segmentation in unmanned aerial vehicle measurement is a long-standing challenge. Since horizontal bounding boxes introduce many interference objects, oriented bounding boxes (OBBs) are usually used for instance identification. However, based on ``segmentation within bounding box'' paradigm, current instance segmentation methods using OBBs are overly dependent on bounding box detection performance. To tackle this, this paper proposes OBSeg, an efficient instance segmentation framework using OBBs. OBSeg is based on box prompt-based segmentation foundation models (BSMs), e.g., Segment Anything Model. Specifically, OBSeg first detects OBBs to distinguish instances and provide coarse localization information. Then, it predicts OBB prompt-related masks for fine segmentation. Since OBBs only serve as prompts, OBSeg alleviates the over-dependence on bounding box detection performance of current instance segmentation methods using OBBs. In addition, to enable BSMs to handle OBB prompts, we propose a novel OBB prompt encoder. To make OBSeg more lightweight and further improve the performance of lightweight distilled BSMs, a Gaussian smoothing-based knowledge distillation method is introduced. Experiments demonstrate that OBSeg outperforms current instance segmentation methods on multiple public datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/zhen6618/OBBInstanceSegmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantifying uncertainty in lung cancer segmentation with foundation models applied to mixed-domain datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13113v2)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image foundation models have shown the ability to segment organs and tumors with minimal fine-tuning. These models are typically evaluated on task-specific in-distribution (ID) datasets. However, reliable performance on ID dataset does not guarantee robust generalization on out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Importantly, once deployed for clinical use, it is impractical to have `ground truth' delineations to assess ongoing performance drifts, especially when images fall into OOD category due to different imaging protocols. Hence, we introduced a comprehensive set of computationally fast metrics to evaluate the performance of multiple foundation models (Swin UNETR, SimMIM, iBOT, SMIT) trained with self-supervised learning (SSL). SSL pretraining was selected as this approach is applicable for large, diverse, and unlabeled image sets. All models were fine-tuned on identical datasets for lung tumor segmentation from computed tomography (CT) scans. SimMIM, iBOT, and SMIT used identical architecture, pretraining, and fine-tuning datasets to assess performance variations with the choice of pretext tasks used in SSL. Evaluation was performed on two public lung cancer datasets (LRAD: n = 140, 5Rater: n = 21) with different image acquisitions and tumor stage compared to training data (n = 317 public resource with stage III-IV lung cancers) and a public non-cancer dataset containing volumetric CT scans of patients with pulmonary embolism (n = 120). All models produced similarly accurate tumor segmentation on the lung cancer testing datasets. SMIT produced a highest F1-score (LRAD: 0.60, 5Rater: 0.64) and lowest entropy (LRAD: 0.06, 5Rater: 0.12), indicating higher tumor detection rate and confident segmentations. In the OOD dataset, SMIT misdetected least number of tumors, indicated by median volume occupancy of 5.67 cc compared to second best method SimMIM of 9.97 cc.</p></details> |  |

To address this, digital pathology foundation models have begun to emerge, typically developed with the size and diversity of the pre-training dataset and model parameters in mind. Here, we present CanvOI, a ViT-g/10-based foundation model designed to enhance the capabilities of digital pathology by addressing these challenges through a different approach. Considering the unique nature of oncologic histopathological images and the requirements from the embeddings to provide meaningful representations for Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) downstream models, we chose to modify the input image characteristics. By introducing larger tile sizes (380 x 380 pixels) and smaller patch sizes (10 x 10 pixels), we were able to optimize the model's performance, pushing computational resources in a new direction and achieving state-of-the-art performance on cancer-related benchmarks. CanvOI demonstrated a 1.5-7.4% improvement in averaged AUC compared to other leading foundation models built for digital pathology. Moreover, our results demonstrate that CanvOI significantly outperformed the other models, with the performance gap widening substantially when trained on just 10% of the initial cohort. This work highlights an alternative approach that, if integrated with traditional development approaches, has the potential to advance Oncology Intelligence (OI), overcome some of the current barriers and ultimately improve the clinical outcome of cancer patients.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Configurable Foundation Models: Building LLMs from a Modular Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02877v1)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in LLMs have recently unveiled challenges tied to computational efficiency and continual scalability due to their requirements of huge parameters, making the applications and evolution of these models on devices with limited computation resources and scenarios requiring various abilities increasingly cumbersome. Inspired by modularity within the human brain, there is a growing tendency to decompose LLMs into numerous functional modules, allowing for inference with part of modules and dynamic assembly of modules to tackle complex tasks, such as mixture-of-experts. To highlight the inherent efficiency and composability of the modular approach, we coin the term brick to represent each functional module, designating the modularized structure as configurable foundation models. In this paper, we offer a comprehensive overview and investigation of the construction, utilization, and limitation of configurable foundation models. We first formalize modules into emergent bricks - functional neuron partitions that emerge during the pre-training phase, and customized bricks - bricks constructed via additional post-training to improve the capabilities and knowledge of LLMs. Based on diverse functional bricks, we further present four brick-oriented operations: retrieval and routing, merging, updating, and growing. These operations allow for dynamic configuration of LLMs based on instructions to handle complex tasks. To verify our perspective, we conduct an empirical analysis on widely-used LLMs. We find that the FFN layers follow modular patterns with functional specialization of neurons and functional neuron partitions. Finally, we highlight several open issues and directions for future research. Overall, this paper aims to offer a fresh modular perspective on existing LLM research and inspire the future creation of more efficient and scalable foundational models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing the vision-language foundation model with key semantic knowledge-emphasized report refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11421v2)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, vision-language representation learning has made remarkable advancements in building up medical foundation models, holding immense potential for transforming the landscape of clinical research and medical care. The underlying hypothesis is that the rich knowledge embedded in radiology reports can effectively assist and guide the learning process, reducing the need for additional labels. However, these reports tend to be complex and sometimes even consist of redundant descriptions that make the representation learning too challenging to capture the key semantic information. This paper develops a novel iterative vision-language representation learning framework by proposing a key semantic knowledge-emphasized report refinement method. Particularly, raw radiology reports are refined to highlight the key information according to a constructed clinical dictionary and two model-optimized knowledge-enhancement metrics. The iterative framework is designed to progressively learn, starting from gaining a general understanding of the patient's condition based on raw reports and gradually refines and extracts critical information essential to the fine-grained analysis tasks. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated on various downstream medical image analysis tasks, including disease classification, region-of-interest segmentation, and phrase grounding. Our framework surpasses seven state-of-the-art methods in both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings, demonstrating its encouraging potential for different clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

Despite efforts to build real-world simulators, leveraging generative models for virtual worlds, like financial markets, remains underexplored. In financial markets, generative models can simulate market effects of various behaviors, enabling interaction with market scenes and players, and training strategies without financial risk. This simulation relies on the finest structured data in financial market like orders thus building the finest realistic simulation. We propose Large Market Model (LMM), an order-level generative foundation model, for financial market simulation, akin to language modeling in the digital world. Our financial Market Simulation engine (MarS), powered by LMM, addresses the need for realistic, interactive and controllable order generation. Key objectives of this paper include evaluating LMM's scaling law in financial markets, assessing MarS's realism, balancing controlled generation with market impact, and demonstrating MarS's potential applications. We showcase MarS as a forecast tool, detection system, analysis platform, and agent training environment. Our contributions include pioneering a generative model for financial markets, designing MarS to meet domain-specific needs, and demonstrating MarS-based applications' industry potential.</p></details> | 19 pages, 12 figures |

To help shape responsible development practices, we introduce the Foundation Model Development Cheatsheet: a growing collection of 250+ tools and resources spanning text, vision, and speech modalities. We draw on a large body of prior work to survey resources (e.g. software, documentation, frameworks, guides, and practical tools) that support informed data selection, processing, and understanding, precise and limitation-aware artifact documentation, efficient model training, advance awareness of the environmental impact from training, careful model evaluation of capabilities, risks, and claims, as well as responsible model release, licensing and deployment practices. We hope this curated collection of resources helps guide more responsible development. The process of curating this list, enabled us to review the AI development ecosystem, revealing what tools are critically missing, misused, or over-used in existing practices. We find that (i) tools for data sourcing, model evaluation, and monitoring are critically under-serving ethical and real-world needs, (ii) evaluations for model safety, capabilities, and environmental impact all lack reproducibility and transparency, (iii) text and particularly English-centric analyses continue to dominate over multilingual and multi-modal analyses, and (iv) evaluation of systems, rather than just models, is needed so that capabilities and impact are assessed in context.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeDiT: General-purpose Diffusion Transformers for Time Series Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02322v1)** | 2024-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With recent advances in building foundation models for texts and video data, there is a surge of interest in foundation models for time series. A family of models have been developed, utilizing a temporal auto-regressive generative Transformer architecture, whose effectiveness has been proven in Large Language Models. While the empirical results are promising, almost all existing time series foundation models have only been tested on well-curated ``benchmark'' datasets very similar to texts. However, real-world time series exhibit unique challenges, such as variable channel sizes across domains, missing values, and varying signal sampling intervals due to the multi-resolution nature of real-world data. Additionally, the uni-directional nature of temporally auto-regressive decoding limits the incorporation of domain knowledge, such as physical laws expressed as partial differential equations (PDEs). To address these challenges, we introduce the Time Diffusion Transformer (TimeDiT), a general foundation model for time series that employs a denoising diffusion paradigm instead of temporal auto-regressive generation. TimeDiT leverages the Transformer architecture to capture temporal dependencies and employs diffusion processes to generate high-quality candidate samples without imposing stringent assumptions on the target distribution via novel masking schemes and a channel alignment strategy. Furthermore, we propose a finetuning-free model editing strategy that allows the seamless integration of external knowledge during the sampling process without updating any model parameters. Extensive experiments conducted on a varity of tasks such as forecasting, imputation, and anomaly detection, demonstrate the effectiveness of TimeDiT.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 Pa...</summary><p>23 Pages, 6 Figures, 11 Tables.

In this paper, we present the foundations of LLM quantization from a convex optimization perspective and propose a quantization method that builds on these foundations and outperforms previous methods. Our quantization framework, CVXQ, scales to models containing hundreds of billions of weight parameters and provides users with the flexibility to compress models to any specified model size, post-training.

| **[Foundation Models for Music: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14340v3)** | 2024-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, foundation models (FMs) such as large language models (LLMs) and latent diffusion models (LDMs) have profoundly impacted diverse sectors, including music. This comprehensive review examines state-of-the-art (SOTA) pre-trained models and foundation models in music, spanning from representation learning, generative learning and multimodal learning. We first contextualise the significance of music in various industries and trace the evolution of AI in music. By delineating the modalities targeted by foundation models, we discover many of the music representations are underexplored in FM development. Then, emphasis is placed on the lack of versatility of previous methods on diverse music applications, along with the potential of FMs in music understanding, generation and medical application. By comprehensively exploring the details of the model pre-training paradigm, architectural choices, tokenisation, finetuning methodologies and controllability, we emphasise the important topics that should have been well explored, like instruction tuning and in-context learning, scaling law and emergent ability, as well as long-sequence modelling etc. A dedicated section presents insights into music agents, accompanied by a thorough analysis of datasets and evaluations essential for pre-training and downstream tasks. Finally, by underscoring the vital importance of ethical considerations, we advocate that following research on FM for music should focus more on such issues as interpretability, transparency, human responsibility, and copyright issues. The paper offers insights into future challenges and trends on FMs for music, aiming to shape the trajectory of human-AI collaboration in the music realm.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we design a prompting module which performs few-shot adaptation of generic deep networks to new tasks. Driven by learning theory, we derive prompting modules that are as simple as possible, as they generalize better under the same training error. We use a case study on video object segmentation to experiment. We give a concrete prompting module, the Semi-parametric Deep Forest (SDForest) that combines several nonparametric methods such as correlation filter, random forest, image-guided filter, with a deep network trained for ImageNet classification task. From a learning-theoretical point of view, all these models are of significantly smaller VC dimension or complexity so tend to generalize better, as long as the empirical studies show that the training error of this simple ensemble can achieve comparable results from a end-to-end trained deep network. We also propose a novel methods of analyzing the generalization under the setting of video object segmentation to make the bound tighter. In practice, SDForest has extremely low computation cost and achieves real-time even on CPU. We test on video object segmentation tasks and achieve competitive performance at DAVIS2016 and DAVIS2017 with purely deep learning approaches, without any training or fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Power Grid Operations with Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02148v1)** | 2024-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The energy transition, crucial for tackling the climate crisis, demands integrating numerous distributed, renewable energy sources into existing grids. Along with climate change and consumer behavioral changes, this leads to changes and variability in generation and load patterns, introducing significant complexity and uncertainty into grid planning and operations. While the industry has already started to exploit AI to overcome computational challenges of established grid simulation tools, we propose the use of AI Foundation Models (FMs) and advances in Graph Neural Networks to efficiently exploit poorly available grid data for different downstream tasks, enhancing grid operations. For capturing the grid's underlying physics, we believe that building a self-supervised model learning the power flow dynamics is a critical first step towards developing an FM for the power grid. We show how this approach may close the gap between the industry needs and current grid analysis capabilities, to bring the industry closer to optimal grid operation and planning.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a pipeline named VSLLaVA that leverages a large language model to integrate expert knowledge for identification of signal parameters and diagnosis of faults. Within this pipeline, we first introduce an expert rule-assisted signal generator. The generator merges signal provided by vibration analysis experts with domain-specific parameter identification and fault diagnosis question-answer pairs to build signal-question-answer triplets. Then we use these triplets to apply low-rank adaptation methods for fine-tuning the linear layers of the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) and large language model, injecting multimodal signal processing knowledge. Finally, the fine-tuned model is assessed through the combined efforts of large language model and expert rules to evaluate answer accuracy and relevance, which showcases enhanced performance in identifying, analyzing various signal parameters, and diagnosing faults. These enhancements indicate the potential of this pipeline to build a foundational model for future industrial signal analysis and monitoring.</p></details> |  |

While these models offer great opportunities, they still face crucial challenges, such as the requirement for fine-grained knowledge understanding in computer-aided diagnosis and the capability of utilizing very limited or even no task-specific labeled data in real-world clinical applications. In this study, we present MaCo, a masked contrastive chest X-ray foundation model that tackles these challenges. MaCo explores masked contrastive learning to simultaneously achieve fine-grained image understanding and zero-shot learning for a variety of medical imaging tasks. It designs a correlation weighting mechanism to adjust the correlation between masked chest X-ray image patches and their corresponding reports, thereby enhancing the model's representation learning capabilities. To evaluate the performance of MaCo, we conducted extensive experiments using 6 well-known open-source X-ray datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MaCo over 10 state-of-the-art approaches across tasks such as classification, segmentation, detection, and phrase grounding. These findings highlight the significant potential of MaCo in advancing a wide range of medical image analysis tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, multi-speaker ASR remains a challenging task for these models due to data scarcity and sparsity. In this paper, we present approaches to enable speech foundation models to process and understand multi-speaker speech with limited training data. Specifically, we adapt a speech foundation model for the multi-speaker ASR task using only telephonic data. Remarkably, the adapted model also performs well on meeting data without any fine-tuning, demonstrating the generalization ability of our approach. We conduct several ablation studies to analyze the impact of different parameters and strategies on model performance. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of our methods. Results show that less parameters give better overall cpWER, which, although counter-intuitive, provides insights into adapting speech foundation models for multi-speaker ASR tasks with minimal annotated data.</p></details> | Accepted by SLT 2024 |

In medical imaging, these models contribute to the advancement of medical diagnoses due to the difficulty in obtaining labeled data. However, it is unclear whether using a large amount of unlabeled data, biased by the presence of sensitive attributes during pre-training, influences the fairness of the model. This research examines the bias in the Foundation model (RetFound) when it is applied to fine-tune the Brazilian Multilabel Ophthalmological Dataset (BRSET), which has a different population than the pre-training dataset. The model evaluation, in comparison with supervised learning, shows that the Foundation Model has the potential to reduce the gap between the maximum AUC and minimum AUC evaluations across gender and age groups. However, in a data-efficient generalization, the model increases the bias when the data amount decreases. These findings suggest that when deploying a Foundation Model in real-life scenarios with limited data, the possibility of fairness issues should be considered.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of paper to be presented at Fairness and Ethics Towards Transparent AI: Facing the Challenge through Model Debiasing (FAILED) during ECCV 2024</p></details> |

A crucial step involves the formulation of a series of specialized prompts that incorporate specific clinical instructions. Past works have been heavily reliant on a singular type of prompt for each instance, necessitating manual input of an ideally correct prompt, which is less efficient. To tackle this issue, we propose to utilize prompts of different granularity, which are sourced from original images to provide a broader scope of clinical insights. However, combining prompts of varying types can pose a challenge due to potential conflicts. In response, we have designed a coarse-to-fine mechanism, referred to as curriculum prompting, that progressively integrates prompts of different types. Through extensive experiments on three public medical datasets across various modalities, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, which not only automates the prompt generation process but also yields superior performance compared to other SAM-based medical image segmentation methods.

Unlike large language models, such as ChatGPT, constructing visual foundation models for image analysis, particularly in remote sensing, encountered significant challenges such as formulating diverse vision tasks into a general problem framework. This paper evaluates the recently released NASA-IBM GFM Prithvi for its predictive performance on high-level image analysis tasks across multiple benchmark datasets. Prithvi was selected because it is one of the first open-source GFMs trained on time-series of high-resolution remote sensing imagery. A series of experiments were designed to assess Prithvi's performance as compared to other pre-trained task-specific AI models in geospatial image analysis. New strategies, including band adaptation, multi-scale feature generation, and fine-tuning techniques, are introduced and integrated into an image analysis pipeline to enhance Prithvi's domain adaptation capability and improve model performance. In-depth analyses reveal Prithvi's strengths and weaknesses, offering insights for both improving Prithvi and developing future visual foundation models for geospatial tasks.</p></details> |  |

While foundation models like Depth Anything Models (DAM) show promise, directly applying them to surgery often yields suboptimal results. Fully fine-tuning on limited surgical data can cause overfitting and catastrophic forgetting, compromising model robustness and generalization. Although Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) addresses some adaptation issues, its uniform parameter distribution neglects the inherent feature hierarchy, where earlier layers, learning more general features, require more parameters than later ones. To tackle this issue, we introduce Depth Anything in Robotic Endoscopic Surgery (DARES), a novel approach that employs a new adaptation technique, Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (Vector-LoRA) on the DAM V2 to perform self-supervised monocular depth estimation in RAS scenes. To enhance learning efficiency, we introduce Vector-LoRA by integrating more parameters in earlier layers and gradually decreasing parameters in later layers. We also design a reprojection loss based on the multi-scale SSIM error to enhance depth perception by better tailoring the foundation model to the specific requirements of the surgical environment. The proposed method is validated on the SCARED dataset and demonstrates superior performance over recent state-of-the-art self-supervised monocular depth estimation techniques, achieving an improvement of 13.3% in the absolute relative error metric.

Specifically for gastric cancer (GC), chronic inflammation causes changes in the mucosa such as atrophy, intestinal metaplasia (IM), dysplasia and ultimately cancer. Early detection through endoscopic regular surveillance is essential for better outcomes. Foundation models (FM), which are machine or deep learning models trained on diverse data and applicable to broad use cases, offer a promising solution to enhance the accuracy of endoscopy and its subsequent pathology image analysis. This review explores the recent advancements, applications, and challenges associated with FM in endoscopy and pathology imaging. We started by elucidating the core principles and architectures underlying these models, including their training methodologies and the pivotal role of large-scale data in developing their predictive capabilities. Moreover, this work discusses emerging trends and future research directions, emphasizing the integration of multimodal data, the development of more robust and equitable models, and the potential for real-time diagnostic support.

Time-domain astrophysics is a canonical example of this imbalance, with the number of supernovae observed photometrically outpacing the number observed spectroscopically by multiple orders of magnitude. At the same time, no data-driven models exist to understand these photometric and spectroscopic observables in a common context. Contrastive learning objectives, which have grown in popularity for aligning distinct data modalities in a shared embedding space, provide a potential solution to extract information from these modalities. We present Maven, the first foundation model for supernova science. To construct Maven, we first pre-train our model to align photometry and spectroscopy from 0.5M synthetic supernovae using a constrastive objective. We then fine-tune the model on 4,702 observed supernovae from the Zwicky Transient Facility. Maven reaches state-of-the-art performance on both classification and redshift estimation, despite the embeddings not being explicitly optimized for these tasks. Through ablation studies, we show that pre-training with synthetic data improves overall performance. In the upcoming era of the Vera C.

However, when it comes to some foundation models like Segment Anything, there is still a challenge in performing well on out-of-distribution data, including camouflaged and medical images. Inconsistent prompting strategies during fine-tuning and testing further compound the issue, leading to decreased performance. Drawing inspiration from how human cognition processes new environments, we introduce SlotSAM, a method that reconstructs features from the encoder in a self-supervised manner to create object-centric representations. These representations are then integrated into the foundation model, bolstering its object-level perceptual capabilities while reducing the impact of distribution-related variables. The beauty of SlotSAM lies in its simplicity and adaptability to various tasks, making it a versatile solution that significantly enhances the generalization abilities of foundation models.

| **[Acceptable Use Policies for Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09041v1)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As foundation models have accumulated hundreds of millions of users, developers have begun to take steps to prevent harmful types of uses. One salient intervention that foundation model developers adopt is acceptable use policies: legally binding policies that prohibit users from using a model for specific purposes. This paper identifies acceptable use policies from 30 foundation model developers, analyzes the use restrictions they contain, and argues that acceptable use policies are an important lens for understanding the regulation of foundation models. Taken together, developers' acceptable use policies include 127 distinct use restrictions; the wide variety in the number and type of use restrictions may create fragmentation across the AI supply chain. Developers also employ acceptable use policies to prevent competitors or specific industries from making use of their models. Developers alone decide what constitutes acceptable use, and rarely provide transparency about how they enforce their policies. In practice, acceptable use policies are difficult to enforce, and scrupulous enforcement can act as a barrier to researcher access and limit beneficial uses of foundation models. Nevertheless, acceptable use policies for foundation models are an early example of self-regulation that have a significant impact on the market for foundation models and the overall AI ecosystem.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, many databases do not provide protected attributes or contain unbalanced representations of demographic groups, complicating the evaluation of model performance across different demographics and the application of bias mitigation techniques that rely on these attributes. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of using the backbone of Foundation Models as an embedding extractor for creating groups that represent protected attributes, such as gender and age. We propose utilizing these groups in different stages of bias mitigation, including pre-processing, in-processing, and evaluation. Using databases in and out-of-distribution scenarios, it is possible to identify that the method can create groups that represent gender in both databases and reduce in 4.44% the difference between the gender attribute in-distribution and 6.16% in out-of-distribution. However, the model lacks robustness in handling age attributes, underscoring the need for more fundamentally fair and robust Foundation models. These findings suggest a role in promoting fairness assessment in scenarios where we lack knowledge of attributes, contributing to the development of more equitable medical diagnostics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of paper to be presented at Fairness of AI in Medical Imaging (FAIMI) during MICCAI 2024</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking foundation models as feature extractors for weakly-supervised computational pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15823v1)** | 2024-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in artificial intelligence have driven the development of numerous pathology foundation models capable of extracting clinically relevant information. However, there is currently limited literature independently evaluating these foundation models on truly external cohorts and clinically-relevant tasks to uncover adjustments for future improvements. In this study, we benchmarked ten histopathology foundation models on 13 patient cohorts with 6,791 patients and 9,493 slides from lung, colorectal, gastric, and breast cancers. The models were evaluated on weakly-supervised tasks related to biomarkers, morphological properties, and prognostic outcomes. We show that a vision-language foundation model, CONCH, yielded the highest performance in 42% of tasks when compared to vision-only foundation models. The experiments reveal that foundation models trained on distinct cohorts learn complementary features to predict the same label, and can be fused to outperform the current state of the art. Creating an ensemble of complementary foundation models outperformed CONCH in 66% of tasks. Moreover, our findings suggest that data diversity outweighs data volume for foundation models. Our work highlights actionable adjustments to improve pathology foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[NeuroLM: A Universal Multi-task Foundation Model for Bridging the Gap between Language and EEG Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00101v1)** | 2024-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements for large-scale pre-training with neural signals such as electroencephalogram (EEG) have shown promising results, significantly boosting the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and healthcare. However, these pre-trained models often require full fine-tuning on each downstream task to achieve substantial improvements, limiting their versatility and usability, and leading to considerable resource wastage. To tackle these challenges, we propose NeuroLM, the first multi-task foundation model that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by regarding EEG signals as a foreign language, endowing the model with multi-task learning and inference capabilities. Our approach begins with learning a text-aligned neural tokenizer through vector-quantized temporal-frequency prediction, which encodes EEG signals into discrete neural tokens. These EEG tokens, generated by the frozen vector-quantized (VQ) encoder, are then fed into an LLM that learns causal EEG information via multi-channel autoregression. Consequently, NeuroLM can understand both EEG and language modalities. Finally, multi-task instruction tuning adapts NeuroLM to various downstream tasks. We are the first to demonstrate that, by specific incorporation with LLMs, NeuroLM unifies diverse EEG tasks within a single model through instruction tuning. The largest variant NeuroLM-XL has record-breaking 1.7B parameters for EEG signal processing, and is pre-trained on a large-scale corpus comprising approximately 25,000-hour EEG data. When evaluated on six diverse downstream datasets, NeuroLM showcases the huge potential of this multi-task learning paradigm.</p></details> | 22 pages, 11 figures |

Despite advances in deep learning and the availability of diverse datasets, FER systems often exhibit higher error rates for individuals with darker skin tones. Existing research predominantly focuses on traditional FER models (CNNs, RNNs, ViTs), leaving a gap in understanding racial biases in LMFMs. We benchmark four leading LMFMs: GPT-4o, PaliGemma, Gemini, and CLIP to assess their performance in facial emotion detection across different racial demographics. A linear classifier trained on CLIP embeddings obtains accuracies of 95.9\% for RADIATE, 90.3\% for Tarr, and 99.5\% for Chicago Face. Furthermore, we identify that Anger is misclassified as Disgust 2.1 times more often in Black Females than White Females. This study highlights the need for fairer FER systems and establishes a foundation for developing unbiased, accurate FER technologies.

| **[Text-guided Foundation Model Adaptation for Long-Tailed Medical Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14770v1)** | 2024-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In medical contexts, the imbalanced data distribution in long-tailed datasets, due to scarce labels for rare diseases, greatly impairs the diagnostic accuracy of deep learning models. Recent multimodal text-image supervised foundation models offer new solutions to data scarcity through effective representation learning. However, their limited medical-specific pretraining hinders their performance in medical image classification relative to natural images. To address this issue, we propose a novel Text-guided Foundation model Adaptation for Long-Tailed medical image classification (TFA-LT). We adopt a two-stage training strategy, integrating representations from the foundation model using just two linear adapters and a single ensembler for balanced outcomes. Experimental results on two long-tailed medical image datasets validate the simplicity, lightweight and efficiency of our approach: requiring only 6.1% GPU memory usage of the current best-performing algorithm, our method achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 27.1%, highlighting the substantial potential of foundation model adaptation in this area.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE ISBI 2024</p></details> |
| **[Training-Free Time-Series Anomaly Detection: Leveraging Image Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14756v1)** | 2024-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in time-series anomaly detection have relied on deep learning models to handle the diverse behaviors of time-series data. However, these models often suffer from unstable training and require extensive hyperparameter tuning, leading to practical limitations. Although foundation models present a potential solution, their use in time series is limited. To overcome these issues, we propose an innovative image-based, training-free time-series anomaly detection (ITF-TAD) approach. ITF-TAD converts time-series data into images using wavelet transform and compresses them into a single representation, leveraging image foundation models for anomaly detection. This approach achieves high-performance anomaly detection without unstable neural network training or hyperparameter tuning. Furthermore, ITF-TAD identifies anomalies across different frequencies, providing users with a detailed visualization of anomalies and their corresponding frequencies. Comprehensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, including univariate and multivariate time series, demonstrate that ITF-TAD offers a practical and effective solution with performance exceeding or comparable to that of deep models.</p></details> |  |
| **[OWSM-CTC: An Open Encoder-Only Speech Foundation Model for Speech Recognition, Translation, and Language Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12654v3)** | 2024-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been an increasing interest in large speech models that can perform multiple tasks in a single model. Such models usually adopt an encoder-decoder or decoder-only architecture due to their popularity and good performance in many domains. However, autoregressive models can be slower during inference compared to non-autoregressive models and also have potential risks of hallucination. Though prior studies observed promising results of non-autoregressive models for certain tasks at small scales, it remains unclear if they can be scaled to speech-to-text generation in diverse languages and tasks. Inspired by the Open Whisper-style Speech Model (OWSM) project, we propose OWSM-CTC, a novel encoder-only speech foundation model based on Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC). It is trained on 180k hours of public audio data for multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech translation (ST), and language identification (LID). Compared to encoder-decoder OWSM, our OWSM-CTC achieves competitive results on ASR and up to 24% relative improvement on ST, while it is more robust and 3 to 4 times faster for inference. OWSM-CTC also improves the long-form ASR result with 20x speed-up. We will publicly release our code, pre-trained model, and training logs to promote open science in speech foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACL 2024 main conference</p></details> |
| **[Surprisingly Fragile: Assessing and Addressing Prompt Instability in Multimodal Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14595v1)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal foundation models (MFMs) such as OFASys show the potential to unlock analysis of complex data such as images, videos, and audio data via text prompts alone. However, their performance may suffer in the face of text input that differs even slightly from their training distribution, which is surprising considering the use of modality-specific data to "ground" the text input. This study demonstrates that prompt instability is a major concern for MFMs, leading to a consistent drop in performance across all modalities, but that instability can be mitigated with additional training with augmented data. We evaluate several methods for grounded prompt perturbation, where we generate perturbations and filter based on similarity to text and/or modality data. After re-training the models on the augmented data, we find improved accuracy and more stable performance on the perturbed test data regardless of perturbation condition, suggesting that the data augmentation strategy helps the models handle domain shifts more effectively. In error analysis, we find consistent patterns of performance improvement across domains, suggesting that retraining on prompt perturbations tends to help general reasoning capabilities in MFMs.</p></details> | in submission |
| **[Hyperdimensional Computing Empowered Federated Foundation Model over Wireless Networks for Metaverse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14416v1)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Metaverse, a burgeoning collective virtual space merging augmented reality and persistent virtual worlds, necessitates advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and communication technologies to support immersive and interactive experiences. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising technique for collaboratively training AI models while preserving data privacy. However, FL faces challenges such as high communication overhead and substantial computational demands, particularly for neural network (NN) models. To address these issues, we propose an integrated federated split learning and hyperdimensional computing (FSL-HDC) framework for emerging foundation models. This novel approach reduces communication costs, computation load, and privacy risks, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained edge devices in the Metaverse, ensuring real-time responsive interactions. Additionally, we introduce an optimization algorithm that concurrently optimizes transmission power and bandwidth to minimize the maximum transmission time among all users to the server. The simulation results based on the MNIST dataset indicate that FSL-HDC achieves an accuracy rate of approximately 87.5%, which is slightly lower than that of FL-HDC. However, FSL-HDC exhibits a significantly faster convergence speed, approximately 3.733x that of FSL-NN, and demonstrates robustness to non-IID data distributions. Moreover, our proposed optimization algorithm can reduce the maximum transmission time by up to 64% compared with the baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[VFMM3D: Releasing the Potential of Image by Vision Foundation Model for Monocular 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09431v2)** | 2024-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to its cost-effectiveness and widespread availability, monocular 3D object detection, which relies solely on a single camera during inference, holds significant importance across various applications, including autonomous driving and robotics. Nevertheless, directly predicting the coordinates of objects in 3D space from monocular images poses challenges. Therefore, an effective solution involves transforming monocular images into LiDAR-like representations and employing a LiDAR-based 3D object detector to predict the 3D coordinates of objects. The key step in this method is accurately converting the monocular image into a reliable point cloud form. In this paper, we present VFMM3D, an innovative framework that leverages the capabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to accurately transform single-view images into LiDAR point cloud representations. VFMM3D utilizes the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Depth Anything Model (DAM) to generate high-quality pseudo-LiDAR data enriched with rich foreground information. Specifically, the Depth Anything Model (DAM) is employed to generate dense depth maps. Subsequently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is utilized to differentiate foreground and background regions by predicting instance masks. These predicted instance masks and depth maps are then combined and projected into 3D space to generate pseudo-LiDAR points. Finally, any object detectors based on point clouds can be utilized to predict the 3D coordinates of objects. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on two challenging 3D object detection datasets, KITTI and Waymo. Our VFMM3D establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on both datasets. Additionally, experimental results demonstrate the generality of VFMM3D, showcasing its seamless integration into various LiDAR-based 3D object detectors.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
