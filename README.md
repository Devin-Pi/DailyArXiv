| **[Machine Learning of Slow Collective Variables and Enhanced Sampling via Spatial Techniques](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20868v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the long-time dynamics of complex physical processes depends on our ability to recognize patterns. To simplify the description of these processes, we often introduce a set of reaction coordinates, customarily referred to as collective variables (CVs). The quality of these CVs heavily impacts our comprehension of the dynamics, often influencing the estimates of thermodynamics and kinetics from atomistic simulations. Consequently, identifying CVs poses a fundamental challenge in chemical physics. Recently, significant progress was made by leveraging the predictive ability of unsupervised machine learning techniques to determine CVs. Many of these techniques require temporal information to learn slow CVs that correspond to the long timescale behavior of the studied process. Here, however, we specifically focus on techniques that can identify CVs corresponding to the slowest transitions between states without needing temporal trajectories as input, instead using the spatial characteristics of the data. We discuss the latest developments in this category of techniques and briefly discuss potential directions for thermodynamics-informed spatial learning of slow CVs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Self-Supervised Robotic System for Autonomous Contact-Based Spatial Mapping of Semiconductor Properties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09892v2)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating robotically driven contact-based material characterization techniques into self-driving laboratories can enhance measurement quality, reliability, and throughput. While deep learning models support robust autonomy, current methods lack reliable pixel-precision positioning and require extensive labeled data. To overcome these challenges, we propose an approach for building self-supervised autonomy into contact-based robotic systems that teach the robot to follow domain expert measurement principles at high-throughputs. Firstly, we design a vision-based, self-supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that uses differentiable image priors to optimize domain-specific objectives, refining the pixel precision of predicted robot contact poses by 20.0% relative to existing approaches. Secondly, we design a reliable graph-based planner for generating distance-minimizing paths to accelerate the robot measurement throughput and decrease planning variance by 6x. We demonstrate the performance of this approach by autonomously driving a 4-degree-of-freedom robotic probe for 24 hours to characterize semiconductor photoconductivity at 3,025 uniquely predicted poses across a gradient of drop-casted perovskite film compositions, achieving throughputs over 125 measurements per hour. Spatially mapping photoconductivity onto each drop-casted film reveals compositional trends and regions of inhomogeneity, valuable for identifying manufacturing process defects. With this self-supervised CNN-driven robotic system, we enable high-precision and reliable automation of contact-based characterization techniques at high throughputs, thereby allowing the measurement of previously inaccessible yet important semiconductor properties for self-driving laboratories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript 18 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Neural Likelihood Surfaces for Spatial Processes with Computationally Intensive or Intractable Likelihoods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04634v4)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In spatial statistics, fast and accurate parameter estimation, coupled with a reliable means of uncertainty quantification, can be challenging when fitting a spatial process to real-world data because the likelihood function might be slow to evaluate or wholly intractable. In this work, we propose using convolutional neural networks to learn the likelihood function of a spatial process. Through a specifically designed classification task, our neural network implicitly learns the likelihood function, even in situations where the exact likelihood is not explicitly available. Once trained on the classification task, our neural network is calibrated using Platt scaling which improves the accuracy of the neural likelihood surfaces. To demonstrate our approach, we compare neural likelihood surfaces and the resulting maximum likelihood estimates and approximate confidence regions with the equivalent for exact or approximate likelihood for two different spatial processes: a Gaussian process and a Brown-Resnick process which have computationally intensive and intractable likelihoods, respectively. We conclude that our method provides fast and accurate parameter estimation with a reliable method of uncertainty quantification in situations where standard methods are either undesirably slow or inaccurate. The method is applicable to any spatial process on a grid from which fast simulations are available.</p></details> | 65 pages, 20 figures |
| **[ESVQA: Perceptual Quality Assessment of Egocentric Spatial Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20423v1)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of eXtended Reality (XR), egocentric spatial shooting and display technologies have further enhanced immersion and engagement for users. Assessing the quality of experience (QoE) of egocentric spatial videos is crucial to ensure a high-quality viewing experience. However, the corresponding research is still lacking. In this paper, we use the embodied experience to highlight this more immersive experience and study the new problem, i.e., embodied perceptual quality assessment for egocentric spatial videos. Specifically, we introduce the first Egocentric Spatial Video Quality Assessment Database (ESVQAD), which comprises 600 egocentric spatial videos and their mean opinion scores (MOSs). Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-dimensional binocular feature fusion model, termed ESVQAnet, which integrates binocular spatial, motion, and semantic features to predict the perceptual quality. Experimental results demonstrate the ESVQAnet outperforms 16 state-of-the-art VQA models on the embodied perceptual quality assessment task, and exhibits strong generalization capability on traditional VQA tasks. The database and codes will be released upon the publication.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |
| **[A Rank-Based Test for Comparing Multiple Fields' Yield Quality Distributions Under Spatial Dependence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20316v1)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a novel rank-based test for comparing yield quality distributions across multiple spatially distributed populations while accounting for spatial dependence. Traditional methods often fail to address the challenges posed by spatial correlation and heterogeneity, leading to unreliable conclusions. The proposed test integrates kernel smoothing with spatially weighted cumulative distribution function (CDF) estimation to ensure robustness against outliers and deviations from distributional assumptions. A test statistic is derived by aggregating squared differences between smoothed CDFs, and its asymptotic properties are established under the null hypothesis, demonstrating convergence to a weighted sum of chi-squared random variables. Practical implementation relies on resampling techniques such as permutation tests and spatial bootstrap methods to approximate the null distribution. The test is consistent under alternatives, making it an effective tool for analyzing spatially dependent data in fields such as environmental monitoring and agricultural research. Extensions to multivariate and spatio-temporal applications are suggested for future work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Clustering of Citizen Science Data Improves Downstream Species Distribution Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15559v2)** | 2024-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Citizen science biodiversity data present great opportunities for ecology and conservation across vast spatial and temporal scales. However, the opportunistic nature of these data lacks the sampling structure required by modeling methodologies that address a pervasive challenge in ecological data collection: imperfect detection, i.e., the likelihood of under-observing species on field surveys. Occupancy modeling is an example of an approach that accounts for imperfect detection by explicitly modeling the observation process separately from the biological process of habitat selection. This produces species distribution models that speak to the pattern of the species on a landscape after accounting for imperfect detection in the data, rather than the pattern of species observations corrupted by errors. To achieve this benefit, occupancy models require multiple surveys of a site across which the site's status (i.e., occupied or not) is assumed constant. Since citizen science data are not collected under the required repeated-visit protocol, observations may be grouped into sites post hoc. Existing approaches for constructing sites discard some observations and/or consider only geographic distance and not environmental similarity. In this study, we compare ten approaches for site construction in terms of their impact on downstream species distribution models for 31 bird species in Oregon, using observations recorded in the eBird database. We find that occupancy models built on sites constructed by spatial clustering algorithms perform better than existing alternatives.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[ST$^3$: Accelerating Multimodal Large Language Model by Spatial-Temporal Visual Token Trimming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20105v1)** | 2024-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enhance their perceptual capabilities by integrating visual and textual information. However, processing the massive number of visual tokens incurs a significant computational cost. Existing analysis of the MLLM attention mechanisms remains shallow, leading to coarse-grain token pruning strategies that fail to effectively balance speed and accuracy. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of MLLM attention mechanisms with LLaVA. We find that numerous visual tokens and partial attention computations are redundant during the decoding process. Based on this insight, we propose Spatial-Temporal Visual Token Trimming ($\textbf{ST}^{3}$), a framework designed to accelerate MLLM inference without retraining. $\textbf{ST}^{3}$ consists of two primary components: 1) Progressive Visual Token Pruning (\textbf{PVTP}), which eliminates inattentive visual tokens across layers, and 2) Visual Token Annealing (\textbf{VTA}), which dynamically reduces the number of visual tokens in each layer as the generated tokens grow. Together, these techniques deliver around $\mathbf{2\times}$ faster inference with only about $\mathbf{30\%}$ KV cache memory compared to the original LLaVA, while maintaining consistent performance across various datasets. Crucially, $\textbf{ST}^{3}$ can be seamlessly integrated into existing pre-trained MLLMs, providing a plug-and-play solution for efficient inference.</p></details> | Accepted to AAAI2025 |
| **[STNMamba: Mamba-based Spatial-Temporal Normality Learning for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20084v1)** | 2024-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) has been extensively researched due to its potential for intelligent video systems. However, most existing methods based on CNNs and transformers still suffer from substantial computational burdens and have room for improvement in learning spatial-temporal normality. Recently, Mamba has shown great potential for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, providing an effective solution to the above dilemma. To this end, we propose a lightweight and effective Mamba-based network named STNMamba, which incorporates carefully designed Mamba modules to enhance the learning of spatial-temporal normality. Firstly, we develop a dual-encoder architecture, where the spatial encoder equipped with Multi-Scale Vision Space State Blocks (MS-VSSB) extracts multi-scale appearance features, and the temporal encoder employs Channel-Aware Vision Space State Blocks (CA-VSSB) to capture significant motion patterns. Secondly, a Spatial-Temporal Interaction Module (STIM) is introduced to integrate spatial and temporal information across multiple levels, enabling effective modeling of intrinsic spatial-temporal consistency. Within this module, the Spatial-Temporal Fusion Block (STFB) is proposed to fuse the spatial and temporal features into a unified feature space, and the memory bank is utilized to store spatial-temporal prototypes of normal patterns, restricting the model's ability to represent anomalies. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our STNMamba achieves competitive performance with fewer parameters and lower computational costs than existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiMSUM: Diffusion Mamba -- A Scalable and Unified Spatial-Frequency Method for Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04168v2)** | 2024-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel state-space architecture for diffusion models, effectively harnessing spatial and frequency information to enhance the inductive bias towards local features in input images for image generation tasks. While state-space networks, including Mamba, a revolutionary advancement in recurrent neural networks, typically scan input sequences from left to right, they face difficulties in designing effective scanning strategies, especially in the processing of image data. Our method demonstrates that integrating wavelet transformation into Mamba enhances the local structure awareness of visual inputs and better captures long-range relations of frequencies by disentangling them into wavelet subbands, representing both low- and high-frequency components. These wavelet-based outputs are then processed and seamlessly fused with the original Mamba outputs through a cross-attention fusion layer, combining both spatial and frequency information to optimize the order awareness of state-space models which is essential for the details and overall quality of image generation. Besides, we introduce a globally-shared transformer to supercharge the performance of Mamba, harnessing its exceptional power to capture global relationships. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, our method demonstrates superior results compared to DiT and DIFFUSSM, achieving faster training convergence and delivering high-quality outputs. The codes and pretrained models are released at https://github.com/VinAIResearch/DiMSUM.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024.

| **[Modeling Continuous Spatial-temporal Dynamics of Turbulent Flow with Test-time Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19927v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The precise simulation of turbulent flows holds immense significance across various scientific and engineering domains, including climate science, freshwater science, and energy-efficient manufacturing. Within the realm of simulating turbulent flows, large eddy simulation (LES) has emerged as a prevalent alternative to direct numerical simulation (DNS), offering computational efficiency. However, LES cannot accurately capture the full spectrum of turbulent transport scales and is present only at a lower spatial resolution. Reconstructing high-fidelity DNS data from the lower-resolution LES data is essential for numerous applications, but it poses significant challenges to existing super-resolution techniques, primarily due to the complex spatio-temporal nature of turbulent flows. This paper proposes a novel flow reconstruction approach that leverages physical knowledge to model flow dynamics. Different from traditional super-resolution techniques, the proposed approach uses LES data only in the testing phase through a degradation-based refinement approach to enforce physical constraints and mitigate cumulative reconstruction errors over time. Furthermore, a feature sampling strategy is developed to enable flow data reconstruction across different resolutions. The results on two distinct sets of turbulent flow data indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method in reconstructing high-resolution DNS data, preserving the inherent physical attributes of flow transport, and achieving DNS reconstruction at different resolutions.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[CAD-GPT: Synthesising CAD Construction Sequence with Spatial Reasoning-Enhanced Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19663v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer-aided design (CAD) significantly enhances the efficiency, accuracy, and innovation of design processes by enabling precise 2D and 3D modeling, extensive analysis, and optimization. Existing methods for creating CAD models rely on latent vectors or point clouds, which are difficult to obtain and costly to store. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have inspired researchers to use natural language instructions and images for CAD model construction. However, these models still struggle with inferring accurate 3D spatial location and orientation, leading to inaccuracies in determining the spatial 3D starting points and extrusion directions for constructing geometries. This work introduces CAD-GPT, a CAD synthesis method with spatial reasoning-enhanced MLLM that takes either a single image or a textual description as input. To achieve precise spatial inference, our approach introduces a 3D Modeling Spatial Mechanism. This method maps 3D spatial positions and 3D sketch plane rotation angles into a 1D linguistic feature space using a specialized spatial unfolding mechanism, while discretizing 2D sketch coordinates into an appropriate planar space to enable precise determination of spatial starting position, sketch orientation, and 2D sketch coordinate translations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAD-GPT consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in CAD model synthesis, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |
| **[MNet-SAt: A Multiscale Network with Spatial-enhanced Attention for Segmentation of Polyps in Colonoscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19464v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: To develop a novel deep learning framework for the automated segmentation of colonic polyps in colonoscopy images, overcoming the limitations of current approaches in preserving precise polyp boundaries, incorporating multi-scale features, and modeling spatial dependencies that accurately reflect the intricate and diverse morphology of polyps. Methods: To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multiscale Network with Spatial-enhanced Attention (MNet-SAt) for polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images. This framework incorporates four key modules: Edge-Guided Feature Enrichment (EGFE) preserves edge information for improved boundary quality; Multi-Scale Feature Aggregator (MSFA) extracts and aggregates multi-scale features across channel spatial dimensions, focusing on salient regions; Spatial-Enhanced Attention (SEAt) captures spatial-aware global dependencies within the multi-scale aggregated features, emphasizing the region of interest; and Channel-Enhanced Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (CE-ASPP) resamples and recalibrates attentive features across scales. Results: We evaluated MNet-SAt on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets, achieving Dice Similarity Coefficients of 96.61% and 98.60%, respectively. Conclusion: Both quantitative (DSC) and qualitative assessments highlight MNet-SAt's superior performance and generalization capabilities compared to existing methods. Significance: MNet-SAt's high accuracy in polyp segmentation holds promise for improving clinical workflows in early polyp detection and more effective treatment, contributing to reduced colorectal cancer mortality rates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Monocular 3D Object Detection from Scene-Level Depth Retargeting to Instance-Level Spatial Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19165v1)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular 3D object detection is challenging due to the lack of accurate depth. However, existing depth-assisted solutions still exhibit inferior performance, whose reason is universally acknowledged as the unsatisfactory accuracy of monocular depth estimation models. In this paper, we revisit monocular 3D object detection from the depth perspective and formulate an additional issue as the limited 3D structure-aware capability of existing depth representations (\textit{e.g.}, depth one-hot encoding or depth distribution). To address this issue, we propose a novel depth-adapted monocular 3D object detection network, termed \textbf{RD3D}, that mainly comprises a Scene-Level Depth Retargeting (SDR) module and an Instance-Level Spatial Refinement (ISR) module. The former incorporates the scene-level perception of 3D structures, retargeting traditional depth representations to a new formulation: \textbf{Depth Thickness Field}. The latter refines the voxel spatial representation with the guidance of instances, eliminating the ambiguity of 3D occupation and thus improving detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate our superiority to existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods and the universality when equipped with different depth estimation models. The code will be available.</p></details> |  |
| **[TraceVLA: Visual Trace Prompting Enhances Spatial-Temporal Awareness for Generalist Robotic Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10345v2)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large vision-language-action (VLA) models pretrained on extensive robot datasets offer promising generalist policies for robotic learning, they still struggle with spatial-temporal dynamics in interactive robotics, making them less effective in handling complex tasks, such as manipulation. In this work, we introduce visual trace prompting, a simple yet effective approach to facilitate VLA models' spatial-temporal awareness for action prediction by encoding state-action trajectories visually. We develop a new TraceVLA model by finetuning OpenVLA on our own collected dataset of 150K robot manipulation trajectories using visual trace prompting. Evaluations of TraceVLA across 137 configurations in SimplerEnv and 4 tasks on a physical WidowX robot demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, outperforming OpenVLA by 10% on SimplerEnv and 3.5x on real-robot tasks and exhibiting robust generalization across diverse embodiments and scenarios. To further validate the effectiveness and generality of our method, we present a compact VLA model based on 4B Phi-3-Vision, pretrained on the Open-X-Embodiment and finetuned on our dataset, rivals the 7B OpenVLA baseline while significantly improving inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Structure Learning for Spatial-Temporal Imputation: Adapting to Node and Feature Scales](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18535v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial-temporal data collected across different geographic locations often suffer from missing values, posing challenges to data analysis. Existing methods primarily leverage fixed spatial graphs to impute missing values, which implicitly assume that the spatial relationship is roughly the same for all features across different locations. However, they may overlook the different spatial relationships of diverse features recorded by sensors in different locations. To address this, we introduce the multi-scale Graph Structure Learning framework for spatial-temporal Imputation (GSLI) that dynamically adapts to the heterogeneous spatial correlations. Our framework encompasses node-scale graph structure learning to cater to the distinct global spatial correlations of different features, and feature-scale graph structure learning to unveil common spatial correlation across features within all stations. Integrated with prominence modeling, our framework emphasizes nodes and features with greater significance in the imputation process. Furthermore, GSLI incorporates cross-feature and cross-temporal representation learning to capture spatial-temporal dependencies. Evaluated on six real incomplete spatial-temporal datasets, GSLI showcases the improvement in data imputation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted as a full paper at AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[VORTEX: A Spatial Computing Framework for Optimized Drone Telemetry Extraction from First-Person View Flight Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18505v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the Visual Optical Recognition Telemetry EXtraction (VORTEX) system for extracting and analyzing drone telemetry data from First Person View (FPV) Uncrewed Aerial System (UAS) footage. VORTEX employs MMOCR, a PyTorch-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) toolbox, to extract telemetry variables from drone Heads Up Display (HUD) recordings, utilizing advanced image preprocessing techniques, including CLAHE enhancement and adaptive thresholding. The study optimizes spatial accuracy and computational efficiency through systematic investigation of temporal sampling rates (1s, 5s, 10s, 15s, 20s) and coordinate processing methods. Results demonstrate that the 5-second sampling rate, utilizing 4.07% of available frames, provides the optimal balance with a point retention rate of 64% and mean speed accuracy within 4.2% of the 1-second baseline while reducing computational overhead by 80.5%. Comparative analysis of coordinate processing methods reveals that while UTM Zone 33N projection and Haversine calculations provide consistently similar results (within 0.1% difference), raw WGS84 coordinates underestimate distances by 15-30% and speeds by 20-35%. Altitude measurements showed unexpected resilience to sampling rate variations, with only 2.1% variation across all intervals. This research is the first of its kind, providing quantitative benchmarks for establishing a robust framework for drone telemetry extraction and analysis using open-source tools and spatial libraries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal joint prediction of traffic spatial-temporal data with graph sparse attention mechanism and bidirectional temporal convolutional network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19842v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic flow prediction plays a crucial role in the management and operation of urban transportation systems. While extensive research has been conducted on predictions for individual transportation modes, there is relatively limited research on joint prediction across different transportation modes. Furthermore, existing multimodal traffic joint modeling methods often lack flexibility in spatial-temporal feature extraction. To address these issues, we propose a method called Graph Sparse Attention Mechanism with Bidirectional Temporal Convolutional Network (GSABT) for multimodal traffic spatial-temporal joint prediction. First, we use a multimodal graph multiplied by self-attention weights to capture spatial local features, and then employ the Top-U sparse attention mechanism to obtain spatial global features. Second, we utilize a bidirectional temporal convolutional network to enhance the temporal feature correlation between the output and input data, and extract inter-modal and intra-modal temporal features through the share-unique module. Finally, we have designed a multimodal joint prediction framework that can be flexibly extended to both spatial and temporal dimensions. Extensive experiments conducted on three real datasets indicate that the proposed model consistently achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Addressing Spatial-Temporal Data Heterogeneity in Federated Continual Learning via Tail Anchor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18355v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated continual learning (FCL) allows each client to continually update its knowledge from task streams, enhancing the applicability of federated learning in real-world scenarios. However, FCL needs to address not only spatial data heterogeneity between clients but also temporal data heterogeneity between tasks. In this paper, empirical experiments demonstrate that such input-level heterogeneity significantly affects the model's internal parameters and outputs, leading to severe spatial-temporal catastrophic forgetting of local and previous knowledge. To this end, we propose Federated Tail Anchor (FedTA) to mix trainable Tail Anchor with the frozen output features to adjust their position in the feature space, thereby overcoming parameter-forgetting and output-forgetting. Moreover, three novel components are also included in FedTA: Input Enhancement for improving the performance of pre-trained models on downstream tasks; Selective Input Knowledge Fusion for fusion of heterogeneous local knowledge on the server side; and Best Global Prototype Selection for finding the best anchor point for each class in the feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedTA not only outperforms existing FCL methods but also effectively preserves the relative positions of features, remaining unaffected by spatial and temporal changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Space-time Video Super-resolution via Spatial-temporal Feature Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08960v4)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The target of space-time video super-resolution (STVSR) is to increase both the frame rate (also referred to as the temporal resolution) and the spatial resolution of a given video. Recent approaches solve STVSR using end-to-end deep neural networks. A popular solution is to first increase the frame rate of the video; then perform feature refinement among different frame features; and last increase the spatial resolutions of these features. The temporal correlation among features of different frames is carefully exploited in this process. The spatial correlation among features of different (spatial) resolutions, despite being also very important, is however not emphasized. In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal feature interaction network to enhance STVSR by exploiting both spatial and temporal correlations among features of different frames and spatial resolutions. Specifically, the spatial-temporal frame interpolation module is introduced to interpolate low- and high-resolution intermediate frame features simultaneously and interactively. The spatial-temporal local and global refinement modules are respectively deployed afterwards to exploit the spatial-temporal correlation among different features for their refinement. Finally, a novel motion consistency loss is employed to enhance the motion continuity among reconstructed frames. We conduct experiments on three standard benchmarks, Vid4, Vimeo-90K and Adobe240, and the results demonstrate that our method improves the state of the art methods by a considerable margin. Our codes will be available at https://github.com/yuezijie/STINet-Space-time-Video-Super-resolution.</p></details> | Neural Networks |

Although benchmarks like MME, MMBench and SEED comprehensively have evaluated various capabilities which already include visual spatial reasoning(VSR). There is still a lack of sufficient quantity and quality evaluation and optimization datasets for Vision Large Language Models(VLLMs) specifically targeting visual positional reasoning. To handle this, we first diagnosed current VLLMs with the VSR dataset and proposed a unified test set. We found current VLLMs to exhibit a contradiction of over-sensitivity to language instructions and under-sensitivity to visual positional information. By expanding the original benchmark from two aspects of tunning data and model structure, we mitigated this phenomenon. To our knowledge, we expanded spatially positioned image data controllably using diffusion models for the first time and integrated original visual encoding(CLIP) with other 3 powerful visual encoders(SigLIP, SAM and DINO). After conducting combination experiments on scaling data and models, we obtained a VLLM VSR Expert(VSRE) that not only generalizes better to different instructions but also accurately distinguishes differences in visual positional information. VSRE achieved over a 27\% increase in accuracy on the VSR test set. It becomes a performant VLLM on the position reasoning of both the VSR dataset and relevant subsets of other evaluation benchmarks. We open-sourced the expanded model with data and Appendix at \url{https://github.com/peijin360/vsre} and hope it will accelerate advancements in VLLM on VSR learning.</p></details> |  |

Analyzing fine-grained and comprehensive relations among stations effectively is imperative for metro OD prediction. However, existing metro OD models either mix information from multiple OD pairs from the station's perspective or exclusively focus on a subset of OD pairs. These approaches may overlook fine-grained relations among OD pairs, leading to difficulties in predicting potential anomalous conditions. To address these challenges, we learn traffic evolution from the perspective of all OD pairs and propose a fine-grained spatial-temporal MLP architecture for metro OD prediction, namely ODMixer. Specifically, our ODMixer has double-branch structure and involves the Channel Mixer, the Multi-view Mixer, and the Bidirectional Trend Learner. The Channel Mixer aims to capture short-term temporal relations among OD pairs, the Multi-view Mixer concentrates on capturing spatial relations from both origin and destination perspectives. To model long-term temporal relations, we introduce the Bidirectional Trend Learner. Extensive experiments on two large-scale metro OD prediction datasets HZMOD and SHMO demonstrate the advantages of our ODMixer.

Historically, optimization-based registration models have harnessed spatially varying regularization to address anatomical subtleties. However, most modern deep learning-based models tend to gravitate towards spatially invariant regularization, wherein a homogenous regularization strength is applied across the entire image, potentially disregarding localized variations. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical probabilistic model that integrates a prior distribution on the deformation regularization strength, enabling the end-to-end learning of a spatially varying deformation regularizer directly from the data. The proposed method is straightforward to implement and easily integrates with various registration network architectures. Additionally, automatic tuning of hyperparameters is achieved through Bayesian optimization, allowing efficient identification of optimal hyperparameters for any given registration task. Comprehensive evaluations on publicly available datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves registration performance and enhances the interpretability of deep learning-based registration, all while maintaining smooth deformations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at http://bit.ly/3BrXGxz</p></details> |
| **[Bayesian Multilevel Bivariate Spatial Modelling of Italian School Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17710v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the relationship between the student's abilities in the second year of high school and the infrastructural endowment in all Italian municipalities, using spatial Bayesian modelling. Municipal student scores are obtained by averaging standardized and spatially homogeneous indicators of student outcomes provided by the Invalsi Institute for two subjects, Italian and Mathematics. Given the nature of the data, we employ a multilevel regression model assuming a bivariate Intrinsic Conditionally Autoregressive (ICAR) latent effect to explain the spatial variability and account for the correlation between the two subjects. Bayesian model estimation is obtained by the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA), implemented in the \texttt{R-INLA} package. We find that alongside a significant association with the current state of school infrastructure and facilities, spatially structured latent effects are still necessary to explain the different student outcomes across municipalities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transport-Hub-Aware Spatial-Temporal Adaptive Graph Transformer for Traffic Flow Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08328v3)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a core technology of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), traffic flow prediction has a wide range of applications. Traffic flow data are spatial-temporal, which are not only correlated to spatial locations in road networks, but also vary with temporal time indices. Existing methods have solved the challenges in traffic flow prediction partly, focusing on modeling spatial-temporal dependencies effectively, while not all intrinsic properties of traffic flow data are utilized fully. Besides, there are very few attempts at incremental learning of spatial-temporal data mining, and few previous works can be easily transferred to the traffic flow prediction task. Motivated by the challenge of incremental learning methods for traffic flow prediction and the underutilization of intrinsic properties of road networks, we propose a Transport-Hub-aware Spatial-Temporal adaptive graph transFormer (H-STFormer) for traffic flow prediction. Specifically, we first design a novel spatial self-attention module to capture the dynamic spatial dependencies. Three graph masking matrices are integrated into spatial self-attentions to highlight both short- and long-term dependences. Additionally, we employ a temporal self-attention module to detect dynamic temporal patterns in the traffic flow data. Finally, we design an extra spatial-temporal knowledge distillation module for incremental learning of traffic flow prediction tasks. Through extensive experiments, we show the effectiveness of H-STFormer in normal and incremental traffic flow prediction tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/Fantasy-Shaw/H-STFormer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Previ...</summary><p>Previous submissions on arxiv are early versions of this manuscript, the latest of which has been rejected by T-ITS.

To address these challenges, Coordinated Spatial Reuse (C-SR) can potentially contribute to optimizing spectrum resource utilization. This mechanism is expected to enable a higher number of simultaneous transmissions, thereby boosting spectral efficiency in dense environments and increasing the overall network performance. In this paper, we focus on the performance analysis of C-SR in Wi-Fi 8 networks. In particular, we consider an implementation of C-SR where channel access and inter-Access Point (AP) communication are performed over-the-air using the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF). For such a purpose, we leverage the well-known Bianchi's throughput model and extend it to support multi-AP transmissions via C-SR. Numerical results in a WLAN network that consists of four APs show C-SR throughput gains ranging from 54% to 280% depending on the inter-AP distance and the position of the stations in the area.</p></details> |  |

Previous works focus on the RGB modality for global environmental modeling, overlooking the potential of multi-source spatial knowledge like depth, speaker position, and environmental semantics. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-source spatial knowledge understanding scheme for immersive VTTS, termed MS2KU-VTTS. Specifically, we first prioritize RGB image as the dominant source and consider depth image, speaker position knowledge from object detection, and Gemini-generated semantic captions as supplementary sources. Afterwards, we propose a serial interaction mechanism to effectively integrate both dominant and supplementary sources. The resulting multi-source knowledge is dynamically integrated based on the respective contributions of each source.This enriched interaction and integration of multi-source spatial knowledge guides the speech generation model, enhancing the immersive speech experience. Experimental results demonstrate that the MS$^2$KU-VTTS surpasses existing baselines in generating immersive speech.

The intuitive solution leverages GroundingDINO to identify the target object from a single frame and SAM 2 to segment the identified object throughout the video, which is less robust to spatiotemporal variations due to a lack of video context exploration. Thus, in our AL-Ref-SAM 2 pipeline, we propose a novel GPT-assisted Pivot Selection (GPT-PS) module to instruct GPT-4 to perform two-step temporal-spatial reasoning for sequentially selecting pivot frames and pivot boxes, thereby providing SAM 2 with a high-quality initial object prompt. Within GPT-PS, two task-specific Chain-of-Thought prompts are designed to unleash GPT's temporal-spatial reasoning capacity by guiding GPT to make selections based on a comprehensive understanding of video and reference information. Furthermore, we propose a Language-Binded Reference Unification (LBRU) module to convert audio signals into language-formatted references, thereby unifying the formats of AVS and RVOS tasks in the same pipeline. Extensive experiments on both tasks show that our training-free AL-Ref-SAM 2 pipeline achieves performances comparable to or even better than fully-supervised fine-tuning methods.

| **[The evolution of cooperation in spatial public goods game with tolerant punishment based on reputation threshold](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17351v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reputation and punishment are significant guidelines for regulating individual behavior in human society, and those with a good reputation are more likely to be imitated by others. In addition, society imposes varying degrees of punishment for behaviors that harm the interests of groups with different reputations. However, conventional pairwise interaction rules and the punishment mechanism overlook this aspect. Building on this observation, this paper enhances a spatial public goods game in two key ways: 1) We set a reputation threshold and use punishment to regulate the defection behavior of players in low-reputation groups while allowing defection behavior in high-reputation game groups. 2) Differently from pairwise interaction rules, we combine reputation and payoff as the fitness of individuals to ensure that players with both high payoff and reputation have a higher chance of being imitated. Through simulations, we find that a higher reputation threshold, combined with a stringent punishment environment, can substantially enhance the level of cooperation within the population. This mechanism provides deeper insight into the widespread phenomenon of cooperation that emerges among individuals.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose the Differential Spatial-Spectral Transformer (DiffFormer), a novel framework designed to address the inherent challenges of HSIC, such as spectral redundancy and spatial discontinuity. The DiffFormer leverages a Differential Multi-Head Self-Attention (DMHSA) mechanism, which enhances local feature discrimination by introducing differential attention to accentuate subtle variations across neighboring spectral-spatial patches. The architecture integrates Spectral-Spatial Tokenization through three-dimensional (3D) convolution-based patch embeddings, positional encoding, and a stack of transformer layers equipped with the SWiGLU activation function for efficient feature extraction (SwiGLU is a variant of the Gated Linear Unit (GLU) activation function). A token-based classification head further ensures robust representation learning, enabling precise labeling of hyperspectral pixels. Extensive experiments on benchmark hyperspectral datasets demonstrate the superiority of DiffFormer in terms of classification accuracy, computational efficiency, and generalizability, compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In addition, this work provides a detailed analysis of computational complexity, showcasing the scalability of the model for large-scale remote sensing applications. The source code will be made available at \url{https://github.com/mahmad000/DiffFormer} after the first round of revision.</p></details> |  |

Sensors like cameras and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) are significantly limited under these conditions, whereas ultrasonic sensors offer a more robust alternative. However, the low angular resolution, slow update frequency, and limited detection accuracy of ultrasonic sensors present barriers for SLAM. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end generative ultrasonic SLAM framework. This framework employs a sensor array with overlapping fields of view, leveraging the inherently low angular resolution of ultrasonic sensors to implicitly encode spatial features in conjunction with the robot's motion. Consecutive time frame data is processed through a sliding window mechanism to capture temporal features. The spatiotemporally encoded sensor data is passed through multiple modules to generate dense scan point clouds and robot pose transformations for map construction and odometry. The main contributions of this work include a novel ultrasonic sensor array that spatiotemporally encodes the surrounding environment, and an end-to-end generative SLAM framework that overcomes the inherent defects of ultrasonic sensors. Several real-world experiments demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures and 1 table</p></details> |

However, substantial challenges remain in detecting tiny objects, as their features occupy only a very small proportion of the feature maps. Although FPN integrates multi-scale features, it does not directly enhance or enrich the features of tiny objects. Furthermore, FPN lacks spatial perception ability. To address these issues, we propose a novel High Frequency and Spatial Perception Feature Pyramid Network (HS-FPN) with two innovative modules. First, we designed a high frequency perception module (HFP) that generates high frequency responses through high pass filters. These high frequency responses are used as mask weights from both spatial and channel perspectives to enrich and highlight the features of tiny objects in the original feature maps. Second, we developed a spatial dependency perception module (SDP) to capture the spatial dependencies that FPN lacks. Our experiments demonstrate that detectors based on HS-FPN exhibit competitive advantages over state-of-the-art models on the AI-TOD dataset for tiny object detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages,12 figures,7 tables</p></details> |

The proposed model addresses a critical gap in functional regression by enabling the analysis of functional responses influenced by spatially correlated functional predictors, a common scenario in fields such as environmental sciences, epidemiology, and socio-economic studies. The model employs a spatial functional principal component decomposition on the response and a classical functional principal component decomposition on the predictor, transforming the functional data into a finite-dimensional multivariate spatial autoregressive framework. This transformation allows efficient estimation and robust handling of spatial dependencies through least squares methods. In a series of extensive simulations, the proposed model consistently demonstrated superior performance in estimating both spatial autocorrelation and regression coefficient functions compared to some favorably existing traditional approaches, particularly under moderate to strong spatial effects. Application of the proposed model to Brazilian COVID-19 data further underscored its practical utility, revealing critical spatial patterns in confirmed cases and death rates that align with known geographic and social interactions. An R package provides a comprehensive implementation of the proposed estimation method, offering a user-friendly and efficient tool for researchers and practitioners to apply the methodology in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Neural Spatial-Temporal Tensor Representation for Infrared Small Target Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17302v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization-based approaches dominate infrared small target detection as they leverage infrared imagery's intrinsic low-rankness and sparsity. While effective for single-frame images, they struggle with dynamic changes in multi-frame scenarios as traditional spatial-temporal representations often fail to adapt. To address these challenges, we introduce a Neural-represented Spatial-Temporal Tensor (NeurSTT) model. This framework employs nonlinear networks to enhance spatial-temporal feature correlations in background approximation, thereby supporting target detection in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, we employ neural layers to approximate sequential backgrounds within a low-rank informed deep scheme. A neural three-dimensional total variation is developed to refine background smoothness while reducing static target-like clusters in sequences. Traditional sparsity constraints are incorporated into the loss functions to preserve potential targets. By replacing complex solvers with a deep updating strategy, NeurSTT simplifies the optimization process in a domain-awareness way. Visual and numerical results across various datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms detection challenges. Notably, it has 16.6$\times$ fewer parameters and averaged 19.19\% higher in $IoU$ compared to the suboptimal method on $256 \times 256$ sequences.</p></details> |  |

Existent RSCD methods often follow a paradigm of using a non-interactive Siamese neural network for multi-temporal feature extraction and change detection heads for feature fusion and change representation. However, this paradigm lacks the contemplation of the characteristics of RSCD in temporal and spatial dimensions, and causes the drawback on spatial-temporal interaction that hinders high-quality feature extraction. To address this problem, we present STeInFormer, a spatial-temporal interaction Transformer architecture for multi-temporal feature extraction, which is the first general backbone network specifically designed for RSCD. In addition, we propose a parameter-free multi-frequency token mixer to integrate frequency-domain features that provide spectral information for RSCD. Experimental results on three datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which can outperform the state-of-the-art methods and achieve the most satisfactory efficiency-accuracy trade-off.

| **[Exploring Spatial Generalized Functional Linear Models: A Comparative Simulation Study and Analysis of COVID-19](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03389v3)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Implementation of spatial generalized linear models with a functional covariate can be accomplished through the use of a truncated basis expansion of the covariate process. In practice, one must select a truncation level for use. We compare five criteria for the selection of an appropriate truncation level, including AIC and BIC based on a log composite likelihood, a fraction of variance explained criterion, a fitted mean squared error, and a prediction error with one standard error rule. Based on the use of extensive simulation studies, we propose that BIC constitutes a reasonable default criterion for the selection of the truncation level for use in a spatial functional generalized linear model. In addition, we demonstrate that the spatial model with a functional covariate outperforms other models when the data contain spatial structure and response variables are in fact influenced by a functional covariate process. We apply the spatial functional generalized linear model to a problem in which the objective is to relate COVID-19 vaccination rates in counties of states in the Midwestern United States to the number of new cases from previous weeks in those same geographic regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pleas...</summary><p>Please see: Generalized linear models with spatial dependence and a functional covariate (arXiv:2402.13472)</p></details> |

For estimation, we apply basis expansion and truncation for dimension reduction of the covariate process followed by a composite likelihood estimating equation to handle the spatial dependency. We establish asymptotic results for the proposed model under a repeating lattice asymptotic context, allowing us to construct a confidence interval for the spatial dependence parameter and a confidence band for the regression parameter function. A binary conditionals model with functional covariates is presented as a concrete illustration and is used in simulation studies to verify the applicability of the asymptotic inferential results. We apply the proposed model to a problem in which the objective is to relate annual corn yield in counties of states in the Midwestern United States to daily maximum temperatures from April to September in those same geographic regions. The extension to an expanding lattice context is further discussed in the supplement.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Temporal-spatial Analysis of Estimating Urban Traffic Patterns Via GPS Trace Data of Car-hailing Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07456v2)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Car-hailing services have become a prominent data source for urban traffic studies. Extracting useful information from car-hailing trace data is essential for effective traffic management, while discrepancies between car-hailing vehicles and urban traffic should be considered. This paper proposes a generic framework for estimating and analyzing urban traffic patterns using car-hailing trace data. The framework consists of three layers: the data layer, the interactive software layer, and the processing method layer. By pre-processing car-hailing GPS trace data with operations such as data cutting, map matching, and trace correction, the framework generates tensor matrices that estimate traffic patterns for car-hailing vehicle flow and average road speed. An analysis block based on these matrices examines the relationships and differences between car-hailing vehicles and urban traffic patterns, which have been overlooked in previous research. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in examining temporal-spatial patterns of car-hailing vehicles and urban traffic. For temporal analysis, urban road traffic displays a bimodal characteristic while car-hailing flow exhibits a 'multi-peak' pattern, fluctuating significantly during holidays and thus generating a hierarchical structure. For spatial analysis, the heat maps generated from the matrices exhibit certain discrepancies, but the spatial distribution of hotspots and vehicle aggregation areas remains similar.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional approaches frequently encounter issues like over-segmentation or mis-segmentation, due to insufficient emphasis on spatial information of instances. In this paper, we introduce a Rule-Guided Spatial Awareness Network (RG-SAN) by utilizing solely the spatial information of the target instance for supervision. This approach enables the network to accurately depict the spatial relationships among all entities described in the text, thus enhancing the reasoning capabilities. The RG-SAN consists of the Text-driven Localization Module (TLM) and the Rule-guided Weak Supervision (RWS) strategy. The TLM initially locates all mentioned instances and iteratively refines their positional information. The RWS strategy, acknowledging that only target objects have supervised positional information, employs dependency tree rules to precisely guide the core instance's positioning. Extensive testing on the ScanRefer benchmark has shown that RG-SAN not only establishes new performance benchmarks, with an mIoU increase of 5.1 points, but also exhibits significant improvements in robustness when processing descriptions with spatial ambiguity.

Previous adversarial attacks against ODs have been focused on designing customized attacks targeting their specific structures (e.g., NMS and RPN), yielding some results but simultaneously constraining their scalability. Moreover, most efforts against ODs stem from image-level attacks originally designed for classification tasks, resulting in redundant computations and disturbances in object-irrelevant areas (e.g., background). Consequently, how to design a model-agnostic efficient attack to comprehensively evaluate the vulnerabilities of ODs remains challenging and unresolved. In this paper, we propose NumbOD, a brand-new spatial-frequency fusion attack against various ODs, aimed at disrupting object detection within images. We directly leverage the features output by the OD without relying on its internal structures to craft adversarial examples. Specifically, we first design a dual-track attack target selection strategy to select high-quality bounding boxes from OD outputs for targeting. Subsequently, we employ directional perturbations to shift and compress predicted boxes and change classification results to deceive ODs. Additionally, we focus on manipulating the high-frequency components of images to confuse ODs' attention on critical objects, thereby enhancing the attack efficiency. Our extensive experiments on nine ODs and two datasets show that NumbOD achieves powerful attack performance and high stealthiness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Spatial feature regularization, effective in traditional methods, remains underexplored in DL-based approaches. Our study integrates spatial feature regularization into DL-based Array-SAR reconstruction, addressing key questions: What spatial features are relevant in urban-area mapping? How can these features be effectively described, modeled, regularized, and incorporated into DL networks? The study comprises five phases: spatial feature description and modeling, regularization, feature-enhanced network design, evaluation, and discussions. Sharp edges and geometric shapes in urban scenes are analyzed as key features. An intra-slice and inter-slice strategy is proposed, using 2D slices as reconstruction units and fusing them into 3D scenes through parallel and serial fusion. Two computational frameworks-iterative reconstruction with enhancement and light reconstruction with enhancement-are designed, incorporating spatial feature modules into DL networks, leading to four specialized reconstruction networks. Using our urban building simulation dataset and two public datasets, six tests evaluate close-point resolution, structural integrity, and robustness in urban scenarios. Results show that spatial feature regularization significantly improves reconstruction accuracy, retrieves more complete building structures, and enhances robustness by reducing noise and outliers.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods focus on incorporating auxiliary information or leveraging knowledge graphs to alleviate the sparsity issue of user purchase sequence data. However, two main challenges limit the performance of these approaches: (1) how to capture dynamic user preferences on complex geospatial information and (2) how to efficiently integrate spatial-temporal knowledge from graphs and sequence data with low calculation costs. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal knowledge distillation for takeaway recommendation model (STKDRec) based on the two-stage training process. Specifically, during the first pre-training stage, a spatial-temporal knowledge graph (STKG) encoder is pre-trained to extract the high-order spatial-temporal and collaborative associations within the STKG. During the second STKD stage, a spatial-temporal Transformer is employed to comprehensively model dynamic user preferences on various types of fine-grained geospatial information from a sequence perspective. Furthermore, the STKD strategy is introduced to adaptively fuse the rich spatial-temporal knowledge from the pre-trained STKG encoder and the spatial-temporal transformer while reducing the cost of model training. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that our STKDRec significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.

However, generalized model-based uncertainty estimation for spatial aggregates requires computationally expensive processes like iterative bootstrapping and computing pixel covariances. Uncertainty estimation for map subregions is critical for enhancing practicality and eventual adoption of model-based data products, as this capability would empower users to produce estimates at scales most germane to management: individual forest stands and ownership parcels. In this study we produced estimates of standard error (SE) associated with spatial averages of AGB predictions for ownership parcels in New York State (NYS). This represents the first model-based uncertainty estimation study to include all four types of uncertainty (reference data, sample variability, residual variability, and auxiliary data), incorporate spatial autocorrelation of model residuals, and use methods compatible with algorithmic modeling. We found that uncertainty attributed to residual variance, largely resulting from spatial correlation of residuals, dominated all other sources for most parcels in the study. These results suggest that improvements to model accuracy will yield the greatest reductions to total uncertainty in regions like the northeastern and midwestern United States where forests are divided into smaller spatial units. Further, we demonstrated that log-log regression relating parcel characteristics (area, perimeter, AGB density, forest cover) to parcel-level SE can accurately estimate uncertainty for map subregions, thus providing a convenient means to empower map users. These findings support transparency in future regional-scale model-based forest carbon accounting and monitoring efforts.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Among these, Ripley's $K$ is a popular metric for assessing whether cells are spatially clustered or are randomly dispersed. However, the key assumption of spatial homogeneity is frequently violated in spatial proteomics data, leading to overestimates of cell clustering and colocalization. To address this, we propose a novel $K$-based method, termed \textit{KAMP} (\textbf{K} adjustment by \textbf{A}nalytical \textbf{M}oments of the \textbf{P}ermutation distribution), for quantifying the spatial organization of cells in spatial proteomics samples. \textit{KAMP} leverages background cells in each sample along with a new closed-form representation of the first and second moments of the permutation distribution of Ripley's $K$ to estimate an empirical null model. Our method is robust to inhomogeneity, computationally efficient even in large datasets, and provides approximate $p$-values for testing spatial clustering and colocalization. Methodological developments are motivated by a spatial proteomics study of 103 women with ovarian cancer, where our analysis using \textit{KAMP} shows a positive association between immune cell clustering and overall patient survival. Notably, we also find evidence that using $K$ without correcting for sample inhomogeneity may bias hazard ratio estimates in downstream analyses. \textit{KAMP} completes this analysis in just 5 minutes, compared to 538 minutes for the only competing method that adequately addresses inhomogeneity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-supervised Spatial-Temporal Learner for Precipitation Nowcasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15917v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowcasting, the short-term prediction of weather, is essential for making timely and weather-dependent decisions. Specifically, precipitation nowcasting aims to predict precipitation at a local level within a 6-hour time frame. This task can be framed as a spatial-temporal sequence forecasting problem, where deep learning methods have been particularly effective. However, despite advancements in self-supervised learning, most successful methods for nowcasting remain fully supervised. Self-supervised learning is advantageous for pretraining models to learn representations without requiring extensive labeled data. In this work, we leverage the benefits of self-supervised learning and integrate it with spatial-temporal learning to develop a novel model, SpaT-SparK. SpaT-SparK comprises a CNN-based encoder-decoder structure pretrained with a masked image modeling (MIM) task and a translation network that captures temporal relationships among past and future precipitation maps in downstream tasks. We conducted experiments on the NL-50 dataset to evaluate the performance of SpaT-SparK. The results demonstrate that SpaT-SparK outperforms existing baseline supervised models, such as SmaAt-UNet, providing more accurate nowcasting predictions.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figures |

We propose a robust path following scheme for the construction of smooth spatial motions by exploiting PH spline curves. In order to cover a general configuration setting, we present a guidance law which is suitable both for fully-actuated and (more common) under-actuated vehicles, which cannot control all the degrees of freedom. The robustness of the guidance law is enhanced by also taking into account the influence of wind or currents into the equations of motion. A selection of numerical experiments validates the effectiveness of the control strategy when $C^1$ spatial PH quintic interpolants are suitably considered for both kinematic and dynamic simulations.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Exploiting Multimodal Spatial-temporal Patterns for Video Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15691v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal tracking has garnered widespread attention as a result of its ability to effectively address the inherent limitations of traditional RGB tracking. However, existing multimodal trackers mainly focus on the fusion and enhancement of spatial features or merely leverage the sparse temporal relationships between video frames. These approaches do not fully exploit the temporal correlations in multimodal videos, making it difficult to capture the dynamic changes and motion information of targets in complex scenarios. To alleviate this problem, we propose a unified multimodal spatial-temporal tracking approach named STTrack. In contrast to previous paradigms that solely relied on updating reference information, we introduced a temporal state generator (TSG) that continuously generates a sequence of tokens containing multimodal temporal information. These temporal information tokens are used to guide the localization of the target in the next time state, establish long-range contextual relationships between video frames, and capture the temporal trajectory of the target. Furthermore, at the spatial level, we introduced the mamba fusion and background suppression interactive (BSI) modules. These modules establish a dual-stage mechanism for coordinating information interaction and fusion between modalities. Extensive comparisons on five benchmark datasets illustrate that STTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance across various multimodal tracking scenarios.

| **[Mask-RadarNet: Enhancing Transformer With Spatial-Temporal Semantic Context for Radar Object Detection in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15595v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a cost-effective and robust technology, automotive radar has seen steady improvement during the last years, making it an appealing complement to commonly used sensors like camera and LiDAR in autonomous driving. Radio frequency data with rich semantic information are attracting more and more attention. Most current radar-based models take radio frequency image sequences as the input. However, these models heavily rely on convolutional neural networks and leave out the spatial-temporal semantic context during the encoding stage. To solve these problems, we propose a model called Mask-RadarNet to fully utilize the hierarchical semantic features from the input radar data. Mask-RadarNet exploits the combination of interleaved convolution and attention operations to replace the traditional architecture in transformer-based models. In addition, patch shift is introduced to the Mask-RadarNet for efficient spatial-temporal feature learning. By shifting part of patches with a specific mosaic pattern in the temporal dimension, Mask-RadarNet achieves competitive performance while reducing the computational burden of the spatial-temporal modeling. In order to capture the spatial-temporal semantic contextual information, we design the class masking attention module (CMAM) in our encoder. Moreover, a lightweight auxiliary decoder is added to our model to aggregate prior maps generated from the CMAM. Experiments on the CRUW dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method to some state-of-the-art radar-based object detection algorithms. With relatively lower computational complexity and fewer parameters, the proposed Mask-RadarNet achieves higher recognition accuracy for object detection in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

Although ST data offers valuable insights into the micro-environment of tumors, its acquisition cost remains expensive. Therefore, directly predicting the ST expressions from digital pathology images is desired. Current methods usually adopt existing regression backbones along with patch-sampling for this task, which ignores the inherent multi-scale information embedded in the pyramidal data structure of digital pathology images, and wastes the inter-spot visual information crucial for accurate gene expression prediction. To address these limitations, we propose M2OST, a many-to-one regression Transformer that can accommodate the hierarchical structure of the pathology images via a decoupled multi-scale feature extractor. Unlike traditional models that are trained with one-to-one image-label pairs, M2OST uses multiple images from different levels of the digital pathology image to jointly predict the gene expressions in their common corresponding spot. Built upon our many-to-one scheme, M2OST can be easily scaled to fit different numbers of inputs, and its network structure inherently incorporates nearby inter-spot features, enhancing regression performance. We have tested M2OST on three public ST datasets and the experimental results show that M2OST can achieve state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters and floating-point operations (FLOPs).</p></details> | <details><summary>Impro...</summary><p>Improved from our previous unpublished work arXiv:2401.10608. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2401.10608</p></details> |

It is a challenging and significant task with numerous applications in visual understanding, human-computer interaction, and robotics. To tackle this challenge, we introduce D-LISA, a two-stage approach incorporating three innovations. First, a dynamic vision module that enables a variable and learnable number of box proposals. Second, a dynamic camera positioning that extracts features for each proposal. Third, a language-informed spatial attention module that better reasons over the proposals to output the final prediction. Empirically, experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on multi-object 3D grounding by 12.8% (absolute) and is competitive in single-object 3D grounding.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

Research on short-term prediction and optimization methods has improved operations and fleet control of car-sharing services; however, long-term projections and spatial analysis are sparse in the literature. We propose to analyze the average monthly demand in a station-based car-sharing service with spatially-aware learning algorithms that offer high predictive performance as well as interpretability. Our study utilizes a rich set of socio-demographic, location-based (e.g., POIs), and car-sharing-specific features as input, extracted from a large proprietary car-sharing dataset and publicly available datasets. We first compare the performance of different modeling approaches and find that a global Random Forest with geo-coordinates as part of input features achieves the highest predictive performance with an R-squared score of 0.87 on test data. While a local linear model, Geographically Weighted Regression, performs almost on par in terms of out-of-sample prediction accuracy. We further leverage the models to identify spatial and socio-demographic drivers of car-sharing demand. An analysis of the Random Forest via SHAP values, as well as the coefficients of GWR and MGWR models, reveals that besides population density and the car-sharing supply, other spatial features such as surrounding POIs play a major role. In addition, MGWR yields exciting insights into the multiscale heterogeneous spatial distributions of factors influencing car-sharing behaviour. Together, our study offers insights for selecting effective and interpretable methods for diagnosing and planning the placement of car-sharing stations.</p></details> | 19 pages, 7 figures |
| **[DroughtSet: Understanding Drought Through Spatial-Temporal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15075v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drought is one of the most destructive and expensive natural disasters, severely impacting natural resources and risks by depleting water resources and diminishing agricultural yields. Under climate change, accurately predicting drought is critical for mitigating drought-induced risks. However, the intricate interplay among the physical and biological drivers that regulate droughts limits the predictability and understanding of drought, particularly at a subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) time scale. While deep learning has been demonstrated with potential in addressing climate forecasting challenges, its application to drought prediction has received relatively less attention. In this work, we propose a new dataset, DroughtSet, which integrates relevant predictive features and three drought indices from multiple remote sensing and reanalysis datasets across the contiguous United States (CONUS). DroughtSet specifically provides the machine learning community with a new real-world dataset to benchmark drought prediction models and more generally, time-series forecasting methods. Furthermore, we propose a spatial-temporal model SPDrought to predict and interpret S2S droughts. Our model learns from the spatial and temporal information of physical and biological features to predict three types of droughts simultaneously. Multiple strategies are employed to quantify the importance of physical and biological features for drought prediction. Our results provide insights for researchers to better understand the predictability and sensitivity of drought to biological and physical conditions. We aim to contribute to the climate field by proposing a new tool to predict and understand the occurrence of droughts and provide the AI community with a new benchmark to study deep learning applications in climate science.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI25 |

Benefiting from the abundance of unlabeled spatial-temporal data, self-supervised methods are increasingly adapted to learn spatial-temporal representations. However, it encounters three key challenges: 1) the difficulty in selecting reliable negative pairs due to the homogeneity of variables, hindering contrastive learning methods; 2) overlooking spatial correlations across variables over time; 3) limitations of efficiency and scalability in existing self-supervised learning methods. To tackle these, we propose a lightweight representation-learning model ST-ReP, integrating current value reconstruction and future value prediction into the pre-training framework for spatial-temporal forecasting. And we design a new spatial-temporal encoder to model fine-grained relationships. Moreover, multi-time scale analysis is incorporated into the self-supervised loss to enhance predictive capability. Experimental results across diverse domains demonstrate that the proposed model surpasses pre-training-based baselines, showcasing its ability to learn compact and semantically enriched representations while exhibiting superior scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 pages.

| **[Consistent Human Image and Video Generation with Spatially Conditioned Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14531v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consistent human-centric image and video synthesis aims to generate images or videos with new poses while preserving appearance consistency with a given reference image, which is crucial for low-cost visual content creation. Recent advances based on diffusion models typically rely on separate networks for reference appearance feature extraction and target visual generation, leading to inconsistent domain gaps between references and targets. In this paper, we frame the task as a spatially-conditioned inpainting problem, where the target image is inpainted to maintain appearance consistency with the reference. This approach enables the reference features to guide the generation of pose-compliant targets within a unified denoising network, thereby mitigating domain gaps. Additionally, to better maintain the reference appearance information, we impose a causal feature interaction framework, in which reference features can only query from themselves, while target features can query appearance information from both the reference and the target. To further enhance computational efficiency and flexibility, in practical implementation, we decompose the spatially-conditioned generation process into two stages: reference appearance extraction and conditioned target generation. Both stages share a single denoising network, with interactions restricted to self-attention layers. This proposed method ensures flexible control over the appearance of generated human images and videos. By fine-tuning existing base diffusion models on human video data, our method demonstrates strong generalization to unseen human identities and poses without requiring additional per-instance fine-tuning. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing competitive performance compared to existing methods for consistent human image and video synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/ljzycmd/SCD</p></details> |

However, in spatial networks, where community structures are not random but constrained by physical and geographical factors, the effect of these structures on the robustness is unclear. This paper investigates the emergence of local communities in road and communication networks, whose nodes are located by population data of major urban areas in Japan, and connected shortly with low cost. We show that, as the strength of community increases, the spatial networks become more vulnerable to both intentional attacks and random failures. As an application point of view, this result suggests that the densely setting nodes of equipments should be avoided under short links in constructing a spatial network. These findings contribute to understanding the important relation between local communities and the robustness of connectivity against attacks and disasters especially in spatial networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 12 figures in main body, 142 pages in total include appendix</p></details> |

However, their high computational cost makes them impractical for applications requiring rapid responses or iterative processes, such as optimization, uncertainty quantification, or inverse modeling. To address this challenge, this work introduces the Dual-Stage Temporal Three-dimensional UNet Super-resolution (DST3D-UNet-SR) model, a highly efficient deep learning model for plume dispersion prediction. DST3D-UNet-SR is composed of two sequential modules: the temporal module (TM), which predicts the transient evolution of a plume in complex terrain from low-resolution temporal data, and the spatial refinement module (SRM), which subsequently enhances the spatial resolution of the TM predictions. We train DST3DUNet- SR using a comprehensive dataset derived from high-resolution large eddy simulations (LES) of plume transport. We propose the DST3D-UNet-SR model to significantly accelerate LES simulations of three-dimensional plume dispersion by three orders of magnitude. Additionally, the model demonstrates the ability to dynamically adapt to evolving conditions through the incorporation of new observational data, substantially improving prediction accuracy in high-concentration regions near the source.

One such example is forecasting the concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the atmosphere which is influenced by many complex factors, the most important ones being diffusion due to meteorological factors as well as transport across vast distances over a period of time. We present a novel Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network architecture, that specifically captures these dependencies to forecast the PM2.5 concentration. Our model is based on an encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder and decoder parts leverage gated recurrent units (GRU) augmented with a graph neural network (TransformerConv) to account for spatial diffusion. Our model can also be seen as a generalization of various existing models for time-series or spatio-temporal forecasting. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness on two real-world PM2.5 datasets: (1) data collected by us using a recently deployed network of low-cost PM$_{2.5}$ sensors from 511 locations spanning the entirety of the Indian state of Bihar over a period of one year, and (2) another publicly available dataset that covers severely polluted regions from China for a period of 4 years. Our experimental results show our model's impressive ability to account for both spatial as well as temporal dependencies precisely.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, International Conference on Data Science and Management of Data (CODS-COMAD), IIT Jodhpur, 2024</p></details> |

More flexible spatial extremes models exhibit appealing extremal dependence properties but are often exceedingly prohibitive to fit and simulate from in high dimensions. In this paper, we aim to push the boundaries on computation and modeling of high-dimensional spatial extremes via integrating a new spatial extremes model that has flexible and non-stationary dependence properties in the encoding-decoding structure of a variational autoencoder called the XVAE. The XVAE can emulate spatial observations and produce outputs that have the same statistical properties as the inputs, especially in the tail. Our approach also provides a novel way of making fast inference with complex extreme-value processes. Through extensive simulation studies, we show that our XVAE is substantially more time-efficient than traditional Bayesian inference while outperforming many spatial extremes models with a stationary dependence structure. Lastly, we analyze a high-resolution satellite-derived dataset of sea surface temperature in the Red Sea, which includes 30 years of daily measurements at 16703 grid cells. We demonstrate how to use XVAE to identify regions susceptible to marine heatwaves under climate change and examine the spatial and temporal variability of the extremal dependence structure.</p></details> | 30 pages, 8 figures |

Previous methods usually quantize the entire body pose into one code, which not only faces the difficulty in encoding all joints within one vector but also loses the spatial relationship between different joints. Differently, in this work we quantize each individual joint into one vector, which i) simplifies the quantization process as the complexity associated with a single joint is markedly lower than that of the entire pose; ii) maintains a spatial-temporal structure that preserves both the spatial relationships among joints and the temporal movement patterns; iii) yields a 2D token map, which enables the application of various 2D operations widely used in 2D images. Grounded in the 2D motion quantization, we build a spatial-temporal modeling framework, where 2D joint VQVAE, temporal-spatial 2D masking technique, and spatial-temporal 2D attention are proposed to take advantage of spatial-temporal signals among the 2D tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous methods across different datasets, with a 26.6% decrease of FID on HumanML3D and a 29.9% decrease on KIT-ML.

Despite significant advancements, most models still struggle with accurate spatial positioning of objects to be grasped. We first show that this spatial generalization challenge stems primarily from the extensive data requirements for adequate spatial understanding. However, collecting such data with real robots is prohibitively expensive, and relying on simulation data often leads to visual generalization gaps upon deployment. To overcome these challenges, we then focus on state-based policy generalization and present \textbf{ManiBox}, a novel bounding-box-guided manipulation method built on a simulation-based teacher-student framework. The teacher policy efficiently generates scalable simulation data using bounding boxes, which are proven to uniquely determine the objects' spatial positions. The student policy then utilizes these low-dimensional spatial states to enable zero-shot transfer to real robots. Through comprehensive evaluations in simulated and real-world environments, ManiBox demonstrates a marked improvement in spatial grasping generalization and adaptability to diverse objects and backgrounds. Further, our empirical study into scaling laws for policy performance indicates that spatial volume generalization scales with data volume in a power law. For a certain level of spatial volume, the success rate of grasping empirically follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics relative to data volume, showing a saturation effect as data increases.

The motivation stems from the observation that images exhibit local structures, and spatially distant regions tend to have minimal interdependence. Given a partially decoded set of visual tokens, in addition to the original next-token prediction scheme in the row dimension, the tokens corresponding to spatially adjacent regions in the column dimension can be decoded in parallel, enabling the ``next-set prediction'' paradigm. By decoding multiple tokens simultaneously in a single forward pass, the number of forward passes required to generate an image is significantly reduced, resulting in a substantial improvement in generation efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that ZipAR can reduce the number of model forward passes by up to 91% on the Emu3-Gen model without requiring any additional retraining.

Recently, graph neural networks based on K-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs have gained prominence in spatial multi-modal omics methods due to their ability to model semantic relations between sequencing spots. However, the fixed KNN graph fails to capture the latent semantic relations hidden by the inevitable data perturbations during the biological sequencing process, resulting in the loss of semantic information. In addition, the common lack of spot annotation and class number priors in practice further hinders the optimization of spatial multi-modal omics models. Here, we propose a novel spatial multi-modal omics resolved framework, termed PRototype-Aware Graph Adaptative Aggregation for Spatial Multi-modal Omics Analysis (PRAGA). PRAGA constructs a dynamic graph to capture latent semantic relations and comprehensively integrate spatial information and feature semantics. The learnable graph structure can also denoise perturbations by learning cross-modal knowledge. Moreover, a dynamic prototype contrastive learning is proposed based on the dynamic adaptability of Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models to optimize the multi-modal omics representations for unknown biological priors. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on simulated and real datasets with 7 competing methods demonstrate the superior performance of PRAGA.

While recent advancements in generative models have been successful in video generation, they often overlook the spatial alignment between audio and visuals, which is essential for immersive experiences. To tackle this problem, we establish a new research direction in benchmarking Spatially Aligned Audio-Video Generation (SAVG). We propose three key components for the benchmark: dataset, baseline, and metrics. We introduce a spatially aligned audio-visual dataset, derived from an audio-visual dataset consisting of multichannel audio, video, and spatiotemporal annotations of sound events. We propose a baseline audio-visual diffusion model focused on stereo audio-visual joint learning to accommodate spatial sound. Finally, we present metrics to evaluate video and spatial audio quality, including a new spatial audio-visual alignment metric. Our experimental result demonstrates that gaps exist between the baseline model and ground truth in terms of video and audio quality, and spatial alignment between both modalities.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

Several advanced methods have achieved satisfying anomaly detection performance. However, they typically concentrate on the external structure of 3D samples and struggle to leverage the internal information embedded within samples. Inspired by the basic intuition of why not look inside for more, we introduce a straightforward method named Internal Spatial Modality Perception (ISMP) to explore the feature representation from internal views fully. Specifically, our proposed ISMP consists of a critical perception module, Spatial Insight Engine (SIE), which abstracts complex internal information of point clouds into essential global features. Besides, to better align structural information with point data, we propose an enhanced key point feature extraction module for amplifying spatial structure feature representation. Simultaneously, a novel feature filtering module is incorporated to reduce noise and redundant features for further aligning precise spatial structure. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving object-level and pixel-level AUROC improvements of 4.2% and 13.1%, respectively, on the Real3D-AD benchmarks. Note that the strong generalization ability of SIE has been theoretically proven and is verified in both classification and segmentation tasks.</p></details> | AAAI2025 Accepted |

This work explores the integration of Transformer based model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based technique to enhance spatial and temporal feature learning in vehicle trajectory prediction. Here, a hybrid model that combines LSTMs for temporal encoding with a Transformer encoder for capturing complex interactions between vehicles is proposed. Spatial trajectory features of the neighboring vehicles are processed and goes through a masked scatter mechanism in a grid based environment, which is then combined with temporal trajectory of the vehicles. This combined trajectory data are learned by sequential LSTM encoding and Transformer based attention layers. The proposed model is benchmarked against predecessor LSTM based methods, including STA-LSTM, SA-LSTM, CS-LSTM, and NaiveLSTM. Our results, while not outperforming it's predecessor, demonstrate the potential of integrating Transformers with LSTM based technique to build interpretable trajectory prediction model. Future work will explore alternative architectures using Transformer applications to further enhance performance. This study provides a promising direction for improving trajectory prediction models by leveraging transformer based architectures, paving the way for more robust and interpretable vehicle trajectory prediction system.</p></details> |  |

We identify two core issues underlying this common failure: 1) the ambiguous nature of spatial-related data in existing datasets, and 2) the inability of current text encoders to accurately interpret the spatial semantics of input descriptions. We address these issues with CoMPaSS, a versatile training framework that enhances spatial understanding of any T2I diffusion model. CoMPaSS solves the ambiguity of spatial-related data with the Spatial Constraints-Oriented Pairing (SCOP) data engine, which curates spatially-accurate training data through a set of principled spatial constraints. To better exploit the curated high-quality spatial priors, CoMPaSS further introduces a Token ENcoding ORdering (TENOR) module to allow better exploitation of high-quality spatial priors, effectively compensating for the shortcoming of text encoders. Extensive experiments on four popular open-weight T2I diffusion models covering both UNet- and MMDiT-based architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of CoMPaSS by setting new state-of-the-arts with substantial relative gains across well-known benchmarks on spatial relationships generation, including VISOR (+98%), T2I-CompBench Spatial (+67%), and GenEval Position (+131%).

GaussTR adopts a Transformer architecture to predict sparse sets of 3D Gaussians that represent scenes in a feed-forward manner. Through aligning rendered Gaussian features with diverse knowledge from pre-trained foundation models, GaussTR facilitates the learning of versatile 3D representations and enables open-vocabulary occupancy prediction without explicit annotations. Empirical evaluations on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset showcase GaussTR's state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, achieving 11.70 mIoU while reducing training duration by approximately 50%.

In some areas, like Baltimore, Maryland, there are only few regulatory (reference) devices but multiple low-cost networks. While there are many available methods to calibrate data from each network individually, separate calibration of each network leads to conflicting air quality predictions. We develop a general Bayesian spatial filtering model combining data from multiple networks and reference devices, providing dynamic calibrations (informed by the latest reference data) and unified predictions (combining information from all available sensors) for the entire region. This method accounts for network-specific bias and noise (observation models), as different networks can use different types of sensors, and uses a Gaussian process (state-space model) to capture spatial correlations. We apply the method to calibrate PM$_{2.5}$ data from Baltimore in June and July 2023 -- a period including days of hazardous concentrations due to wildfire smoke. Our method helps mitigate the effects of preferential sampling of one network in Baltimore, results in better predictions and narrower confidence intervals. Our approach can be used to calibrate low-cost air pollution sensor data in Baltimore and any other areas with multiple low-cost networks.</p></details> |  |

Visual Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong scene understanding and planning capabilities but lack the ability to generate actionable policies tailored to specific robotic embodiments. To address this, Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged, yet they face challenges in long-horizon spatial reasoning and grounded task planning. In this work, we propose the Embodied Multimodal Action Model with Grounded Chain of Thought and Look-ahead Spatial Reasoning, Emma-X.

| **[CATSplat: Context-Aware Transformer with Spatial Guidance for Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting from A Single-View Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12906v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, generalizable feed-forward methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting have gained significant attention for their potential to reconstruct 3D scenes using finite resources. These approaches create a 3D radiance field, parameterized by per-pixel 3D Gaussian primitives, from just a few images in a single forward pass. However, unlike multi-view methods that benefit from cross-view correspondences, 3D scene reconstruction with a single-view image remains an underexplored area. In this work, we introduce CATSplat, a novel generalizable transformer-based framework designed to break through the inherent constraints in monocular settings. First, we propose leveraging textual guidance from a visual-language model to complement insufficient information from a single image. By incorporating scene-specific contextual details from text embeddings through cross-attention, we pave the way for context-aware 3D scene reconstruction beyond relying solely on visual cues. Moreover, we advocate utilizing spatial guidance from 3D point features toward comprehensive geometric understanding under single-view settings. With 3D priors, image features can capture rich structural insights for predicting 3D Gaussians without multi-view techniques. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CATSplat in single-view 3D scene reconstruction with high-quality novel view synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatic Left Ventricular Cavity Segmentation via Deep Spatial Sequential Network in 4D Computed Tomography Studies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12853v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated segmentation of left ventricular cavity (LVC) in temporal cardiac image sequences (multiple time points) is a fundamental requirement for quantitative analysis of its structural and functional changes. Deep learning based methods for the segmentation of LVC are the state of the art; however, these methods are generally formulated to work on single time points, and fails to exploit the complementary information from the temporal image sequences that can aid in segmentation accuracy and consistency among the images across the time points. Furthermore, these segmentation methods perform poorly in segmenting the end-systole (ES) phase images, where the left ventricle deforms to the smallest irregular shape, and the boundary between the blood chamber and myocardium becomes inconspicuous. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new method to automatically segment temporal cardiac images where we introduce a spatial sequential (SS) network to learn the deformation and motion characteristics of the LVC in an unsupervised manner; these characteristics were then integrated with sequential context information derived from bi-directional learning (BL) where both chronological and reverse-chronological directions of the image sequence were used. Our experimental results on a cardiac computed tomography (CT) dataset demonstrated that our spatial-sequential network with bi-directional learning (SS-BL) method outperformed existing methods for LVC segmentation. Our method was also applied to MRI cardiac dataset and the results demonstrated the generalizability of our method.</p></details> | 9 pages |

However, the lack of justified graph kernels for spatio-temporal modelling has held back their use in graph problems. We leverage an explicit link between stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) and GPs on graphs, introduce a framework for deriving graph kernels via SPDEs, and derive non-separable spatio-temporal graph kernels that capture interaction across space and time. We formulate the graph kernels for the stochastic heat equation and wave equation. We show that by providing novel tools for spatio-temporal GP modelling on graphs, we outperform pre-existing graph kernels in real-world applications that feature diffusion, oscillation, and other complicated interactions.</p></details> |  |

However, existing whole-body-object interaction video benchmarks overlook the truth that open-world objects are diverse, that is, they usually provide limited and predefined object classes. Therefore, we introduce a new open-world benchmark: Grounding Interacted Objects (GIO) including 1,098 interacted objects class and 290K interacted object boxes annotation. Accordingly, an object grounding task is proposed expecting vision systems to discover interacted objects. Even though today's detectors and grounding methods have succeeded greatly, they perform unsatisfactorily in localizing diverse and rare objects in GIO. This profoundly reveals the limitations of current vision systems and poses a great challenge. Thus, we explore leveraging spatio-temporal cues to address object grounding and propose a 4D question-answering framework (4D-QA) to discover interacted objects from diverse videos. Our method demonstrates significant superiority in extensive experiments compared to current baselines.

By analyzing data over a 30-day period with comparable climate and average temperatures, we explored differences in BSS usage between weekdays and weekends in those cities using Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) and rank distribution analysis. Our findings reveal significant temporal differences in BSS usage that were commonly observed in all cities, with weekday patterns dominated by commute peaks and weekend patterns reflecting recreational activities. Friday emerges as a transitional day, sharing the characteristics of both weekdays and weekends. Meanwhile, docking station usage rank distributions show remarkable consistency between weekdays and weekends for most cities, with London being a unique anomaly. This study highlights the potential of BSS data to uncover urban mobility patterns and the underlying structures of cities. The results suggest that BSS usage reflects both intrinsic user behavior and external influences such as urban planning.</p></details> | 16pages, 5figures |

However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, Submitted to TMM in 30-May-2024</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Electromagnetic Kernel Learning for Channel Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17414v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate channel prediction is essential for addressing channel aging caused by user mobility. However, the actual channel variations over time are highly complex in high-mobility scenarios, which makes it difficult for existing predictors to obtain future channels accurately. The low accuracy of channel predictors leads to difficulties in supporting reliable communication. To overcome this challenge, we propose a channel predictor based on spatio-temporal electromagnetic (EM) kernel learning (STEM-KL). Specifically, inspired by recent advancements in EM information theory (EIT), the STEM kernel function is derived. The velocity and the concentration kernel parameters are designed to reflect the time-varying propagation of the wireless signal. We obtain the parameters through kernel learning. Then, the future channels are predicted by computing their Bayesian posterior, with the STEM kernel acting as the prior. To further improve the stability and model expressibility, we propose a grid-based EM mixed kernel learning (GEM-KL) scheme. We design the mixed kernel to be a convex combination of multiple sub-kernels, where each of the sub-kernel corresponds to a grid point in the set of pre-selected parameters. This approach transforms non-convex STEM kernel learning problem into a convex grid-based problem that can be easily solved by weight optimization. Finally, simulation results verify that the proposed STEM-KL and GEM-KL schemes can achieve more accurate channel prediction. This indicates that EIT can improve the performance of wireless system efficiently.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper proposes an EIT-inspired Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based channel predictor with improved performance.

| **[Leveraging Consistent Spatio-Temporal Correspondence for Robust Visual Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16923v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent approaches to VO have significantly improved performance by using deep networks to predict optical flow between video frames. However, existing methods still suffer from noisy and inconsistent flow matching, making it difficult to handle challenging scenarios and long-sequence estimation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Spatio-Temporal Visual Odometry (STVO), a novel deep network architecture that effectively leverages inherent spatio-temporal cues to enhance the accuracy and consistency of multi-frame flow matching. With more accurate and consistent flow matching, STVO can achieve better pose estimation through the bundle adjustment (BA). Specifically, STVO introduces two innovative components: 1) the Temporal Propagation Module that utilizes multi-frame information to extract and propagate temporal cues across adjacent frames, maintaining temporal consistency; 2) the Spatial Activation Module that utilizes geometric priors from the depth maps to enhance spatial consistency while filtering out excessive noise and incorrect matches. Our STVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on TUM-RGBD, EuRoc MAV, ETH3D and KITTI Odometry benchmarks. Notably, it improves accuracy by 77.8% on ETH3D benchmark and 38.9% on KITTI Odometry benchmark over the previous best methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning for Spatio-Temporal Fusion in Land Surface Temperature Estimation: A Comprehensive Survey, Experimental Analysis, and Future Trends](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16631v1)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in satellite remote sensing have enhanced the capability to monitor and analyze the Earth's surface. Among the many variables captured through satellite sensors, Land Surface Temperature (LST) plays a critical role in understanding key environmental processes. However, obtaining high-resolution LST data remains a challenge, as satellite sensors often face a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions. In response, Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) has emerged as a powerful method to integrate two satellite data sources, one providing high spatial but low temporal resolution, and the other offering high temporal but low spatial resolution. Although a range of STF techniques have been proposed, from traditional methods to cutting-edge deep learning (DL) models, most have focused on surface reflectance, with limited application to LST estimation. DL approaches, in particular, show promise in improving the spatial and temporal resolutions of LST by capturing complex, non-linear relationships between input and output LST data. This paper offers a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in DL-based STF techniques for LST estimation. We analyze key research developments, mathematically formulate the STF problem, and introduce a novel taxonomy for DL-based STF methods. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges faced by current methods and highlight future research directions. In addition, we present the first open-source benchmark STF dataset for LST estimation, consisting of 51 pairs of MODIS-Landsat images spanning from 2013 to 2024. To support our findings, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art methods and present both quantitative and qualitative assessments. This is the first survey paper focused on DL-based STF for LST estimation. We hope it serves as a valuable reference for researchers and paves the way for future research in this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Proceedings of IEEE</p></details> |
| **[Clustering Time-Evolving Networks Using the Spatio-Temporal Graph Laplacian](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12864v3)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-evolving graphs arise frequently when modeling complex dynamical systems such as social networks, traffic flow, and biological processes. Developing techniques to identify and analyze communities in these time-varying graph structures is an important challenge. In this work, we generalize existing spectral clustering algorithms from static to dynamic graphs using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to capture the temporal evolution of clusters. Based on this extended canonical correlation framework, we define the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian and investigate its spectral properties. We connect these concepts to dynamical systems theory via transfer operators, and illustrate the advantages of our method on benchmark graphs by comparison with existing methods. We show that the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian allows for a clear interpretation of cluster structure evolution over time for directed and undirected graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Dynamic Edge Service Placement Under Spatio-Temporal Correlated Demand Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15608v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Edge computing allows Service Providers (SPs) to enhance user experience by placing their services closer to the network edge. Determining the optimal provisioning of edge resources to meet the varying and uncertain demand cost-effectively is a critical task for SPs. This paper introduces a novel two-stage multi-period robust model for edge service placement and workload allocation, aiming to minimize the SP's operating costs while ensuring service quality. The salient feature of this model lies in its ability to enable SPs to utilize dynamic service placement and leverage spatio-temporal correlation in demand uncertainties to mitigate the inherent conservatism of robust solutions. In our model, resource reservation is optimized in the initial stage, preemptively, before the actual demand is disclosed, whereas dynamic service placement and workload allocation are determined in the subsequent stage, following the revelation of uncertainties. To address the challenges posed by integer recourse variables in the second stage of the resulting tri-level adjustable robust optimization problem, we propose a novel iterative, decomposition-based approach, ensuring finite convergence to an exact optimal solution. Extensive numerical results are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model and approach.</p></details> | 15 pages |

Yet, causal inference with these data remains challenging due to the twin threats of spatial spillover and temporal carryover effects. We develop methods to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects by allowing for arbitrary spatial and temporal causal dependencies. We focus on common settings where the treatment and outcomes are time-varying spatial point patterns and where moderators are either spatial or spatio-temporal in nature. We define causal estimands based on stochastic interventions where researchers specify counterfactual distributions of treatment events. We propose the Hajek-type estimator of the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) as a function of spatio-temporal moderator variables, and establish its asymptotic normality as the number of time periods increases. We then introduce a statistical test of no heterogeneous treatment effects. Through simulations, we evaluate the finite-sample performance of the proposed CATE estimator and its inferential properties. Our motivating application examines the heterogeneous effects of US airstrikes on insurgent violence in Iraq. Drawing on declassified spatio-temporal data, we examine how prior aid distributions moderate airstrike effects. Contrary to expectations from counterinsurgency theories, we find that prior aid distribution, along with greater amounts of aid per capita, is associated with increased insurgent attacks following airstrikes.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we propose a novel fall detection system using FLAMe (Federated Learning with Attention Mechanism), a federated learning (FL) based algorithm. FLAMe trains around important keypoint information and only transmits the trained important weights to the server, reducing communication costs and preserving data privacy. Furthermore, the lightweight keypoint transformer model is integrated into the FL framework to effectively learn spatio-temporal features. We validated the experiment using 22,672 video samples from the "Fall Accident Risk Behavior Video-Sensor Pair data" dataset from AI-Hub. As a result of the experiment, the FLAMe-based system achieved an accuracy of 94.02% with about 190,000 transmission parameters, maintaining performance similar to that of existing centralized learning while maximizing efficiency by reducing communication costs by about 40% compared to the existing FL algorithm, FedAvg. Therefore, the FLAMe algorithm has demonstrated that it provides robust performance in the distributed environment of smart cities and is a practical and effective solution for public safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, AAAI 2025 FLUID Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Global Spatio-Temporal Fusion-based Traffic Prediction Algorithm with Anomaly Aware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14569v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic prediction is an indispensable component of urban planning and traffic management. Achieving accurate traffic prediction hinges on the ability to capture the potential spatio-temporal relationships among road sensors. However, the majority of existing works focus on local short-term spatio-temporal correlations, failing to fully consider the interactions of different sensors in the long-term state. In addition, these works do not analyze the influences of anomalous factors, or have insufficient ability to extract personalized features of anomalous factors, which make them ineffectively capture their spatio-temporal influences on traffic prediction. To address the aforementioned issues, We propose a global spatio-temporal fusion-based traffic prediction algorithm that incorporates anomaly awareness. Initially, based on the designed anomaly detection network, we construct an efficient anomalous factors impacting module (AFIM), to evaluate the spatio-temporal impact of unexpected external events on traffic prediction. Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale spatio-temporal feature fusion module (MTSFFL) based on the transformer architecture, to obtain all possible both long and short term correlations among different sensors in a wide-area traffic environment for accurate prediction of traffic flow. Finally, experiments are implemented based on real-scenario public transportation datasets (PEMS04 and PEMS08) to demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

One such example is forecasting the concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the atmosphere which is influenced by many complex factors, the most important ones being diffusion due to meteorological factors as well as transport across vast distances over a period of time. We present a novel Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network architecture, that specifically captures these dependencies to forecast the PM2.5 concentration. Our model is based on an encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder and decoder parts leverage gated recurrent units (GRU) augmented with a graph neural network (TransformerConv) to account for spatial diffusion. Our model can also be seen as a generalization of various existing models for time-series or spatio-temporal forecasting. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness on two real-world PM2.5 datasets: (1) data collected by us using a recently deployed network of low-cost PM$_{2.5}$ sensors from 511 locations spanning the entirety of the Indian state of Bihar over a period of one year, and (2) another publicly available dataset that covers severely polluted regions from China for a period of 4 years. Our experimental results show our model's impressive ability to account for both spatial as well as temporal dependencies precisely.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, International Conference on Data Science and Management of Data (CODS-COMAD), IIT Jodhpur, 2024</p></details> |

This discrepancy arises primarily from the high costs associated with the input of existing representation models, which often require street views and mobility data. To address this, we develop a novel, training-free method that leverages large language models (LLMs) and auxiliary map data from OpenStreetMap to derive geolocation representations (LLMGeovec). LLMGeovec can represent the geographic semantics of city, country, and global scales, which acts as a generic enhancer for spatio-temporal learning. Specifically, by direct feature concatenation, we introduce a simple yet effective paradigm for enhancing multiple spatio-temporal tasks including geographic prediction (GP), long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), and graph-based spatio-temporal forecasting (GSTF). LLMGeovec can seamlessly integrate into a wide spectrum of spatio-temporal learning models, providing immediate enhancements. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMGeovec achieves global coverage and significantly boosts the performance of leading GP, LTSF, and GSTF models.

An established measure for quantifying data freshness is the Age-of-Information (AoI), which has been the subject of extensive research. Recently, there has been increased interest in multi-sensor systems: redundant sensors producing samples of the same physical process, sensors such as cameras producing overlapping views, or distributed sensors producing correlated samples. When the information from a particular sensor is outdated, fresh samples from other correlated sensors can be helpful. To quantify the utility of distant but correlated samples, we put forth a two-dimensional (2D) model of AoI that takes into account the sensor distance in an age-equivalent representation. Since we define 2D-AoI as equivalent to AoI, it can be readily linked to existing AoI research, especially on parallel systems. We consider physical phenomena modeled as spatio-temporal processes and derive the 2D-AoI for different Gaussian correlation kernels. For a basic exponential product kernel, we find that spatial distance causes an additive offset of the AoI, while for other kernels the effects of spatial distance are more complex and vary with time. Using our methodology, we evaluate the 2D-AoI of different spatial topologies and sensor densities.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the development of TextVQA in image domain, existing Video TextVQA approaches leverage a language model (e.g. T5) to process text-rich multiple frames and generate answers auto-regressively. Nevertheless, the spatio-temporal relationships among visual entities (including scene text and objects) will be disrupted and models are susceptible to interference from unrelated information, resulting in irrational reasoning and inaccurate answering. To tackle these challenges, we propose the TEA (stands for ``\textbf{T}rack th\textbf{E} \textbf{A}nswer'') method that better extends the generative TextVQA framework from image to video. TEA recovers the spatio-temporal relationships in a complementary way and incorporates OCR-aware clues to enhance the quality of reasoning questions. Extensive experiments on several public Video TextVQA datasets validate the effectiveness and generalization of our framework. TEA outperforms existing TextVQA methods, video-language pretraining methods and video large language models by great margins.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

So is statistics, the queen of science. Big data are particularly relevant to spatio-temporal statistics, thanks to much-improved technology in satellite based remote sensing and Geographical Information Systems. However, none of the existing approaches seem to meet the simultaneous demand of reality emulation and cheap computation. In this article, with the Levy random fields as the starting point, e construct a new Bayesian nonparametric, nonstationary and nonseparable dynamic spatio-temporal model with the additional realistic property that the lagged spatio-temporal correlations converge to zero as the lag tends to infinity. Although our Bayesian model seems to be intricately structured and is variable-dimensional with respect to each time index, we are able to devise a fast and efficient parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for Bayesian inference. Our simulation experiment brings out quite encouraging performance from our Bayesian Levy-dynamic approach. We finally apply our Bayesian Levy-dynamic model and methods to a sea surface temperature dataset consisting of 139,300 data points in space and time. Although not big data in the true sense, this is a large and highly structured data by any standard. Even for this large and complex data, our parallel MCMC algorithm, implemented on 80 processors, generated 110,000 MCMC realizations from the Levy-dynamic posterior within a single day, and the resultant Bayesian posterior predictive analysis turned out to be encouraging. Thus, it is not unreasonable to expect that with significantly more computing resources, it is feasible to analyse terabytes of spatio-temporal data with our new model and methods.</p></details> | An updated version |

However, the complex and dynamic nature of these correlations presents significant modeling challenges. To address this, we propose a spatio-temporal dynamic hypergraph learning (STDHL) model. This model uses a hypergraph structure to represent spatial features among wind farms. Unlike traditional graph structures, which only capture pair-wise node features, hypergraphs create hyperedges connecting multiple nodes, enabling the representation and transmission of higher-order spatial features. The STDHL model incorporates a novel dynamic hypergraph convolutional layer to model dynamic spatial correlations and a grouped temporal convolutional layer for channel-independent temporal modeling. The model uses spatio-temporal encoders to extract features from multi-source covariates, which are mapped to quantile results through a forecast decoder. Experimental results using the GEFCom dataset show that the STDHL model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis highlights the critical role of spatio-temporal covariates in improving ultra-short-term forecasting accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, existing transformer-based methods primarily use self-attention mechanisms for spatio-temporal modeling, leading to a quadratic complexity, unidirectional modeling of spatio-temporal relationships, and insufficient learning of spatial-temporal correlations. Recently, the Mamba architecture, utilizing the state space model (SSM), has exhibited superior long-range modeling capabilities in a variety of vision tasks with linear complexity. In this paper, we propose PoseMamba, a novel purely SSM-based approach with linear complexity for 3D human pose estimation in monocular video. Specifically, we propose a bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block that comprehensively models human joint relations within individual frames as well as temporal correlations across frames. Within this bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block, we introduce a reordering strategy to enhance the local modeling capability of the SSM. This strategy provides a more logical geometric scanning order and integrates it with the global SSM, resulting in a combined global-local spatial scan. We have quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated our approach using two benchmark datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoseMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets while maintaining a smaller model size and reducing computational costs. The code and models will be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accpe...</summary><p>Accpeted by the 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[B-VLLM: A Vision Large Language Model with Balanced Spatio-Temporal Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09919v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) integrated with vision encoders have shown promising performance in vision understanding. The key of VLLMs is to encode visual content into sequences of visual tokens, enabling VLLMs to simultaneously process both visual and textual content. However, understanding videos, especially long videos, remain a challenge to VLLMs as the number of visual tokens grows rapidly when encoding videos, resulting in the risk of exceeding the context window of VLLMs and introducing heavy computation burden. To restrict the number of visual tokens, existing VLLMs either: (1) uniformly downsample videos into a fixed number of frames or (2) reducing the number of visual tokens encoded from each frame. We argue the former solution neglects the rich temporal cue in videos and the later overlooks the spatial details in each frame. In this work, we present Balanced-VLLM (B-VLLM): a novel VLLM framework that aims to effectively leverage task relevant spatio-temporal cues while restricting the number of visual tokens under the VLLM context window length. At the core of our method, we devise a text-conditioned adaptive frame selection module to identify frames relevant to the visual understanding task. The selected frames are then de-duplicated using a temporal frame token merging technique. The visual tokens of the selected frames are processed through a spatial token sampling module and an optional spatial token merging strategy to achieve precise control over the token count. Experimental results show that B-VLLM is effective in balancing the number of frames and visual tokens in video understanding, yielding superior performance on various video understanding benchmarks.

Recently, we have witnessed the rise of variational autoencoder-based latent factor models, which learn latent factors self-adaptively. While these models focus on modeling overall market conditions, they often fail to effectively capture the temporal patterns of individual stocks. Additionally, representing multiple factors as single values simplifies the model but limits its ability to capture complex relationships and dependencies. As a result, the learned factors are of low quality and lack diversity, reducing their effectiveness and robustness across different trading periods. To address these issues, we propose a Spatio-Temporal factOR Model based on dual vector quantized variational autoencoders, named STORM, which extracts features of stocks from temporal and spatial perspectives, then fuses and aligns these features at the fine-grained and semantic level, and represents the factors as multi-dimensional embeddings. The discrete codebooks cluster similar factor embeddings, ensuring orthogonality and diversity, which helps distinguish between different factors and enables factor selection in financial trading. To show the performance of the proposed factor model, we apply it to two downstream experiments: portfolio management on two stock datasets and individual trading tasks on six specific stocks. The extensive experiments demonstrate STORM's flexibility in adapting to downstream tasks and superior performance over baseline models.</p></details> |  |

Schr\"odinger in 1931/32. It represents an early formulation of a maximum likelihood problem. This specific formulation can also be seen as the control problem to modify the law of a diffusion process so as to match specifications on marginal distributions at given times. Thereby, in recent years, this so-called Schr\"odinger's bridge problem has been at the center of the uncertainty control development. However, an understudied facet of this program has been to address uncertainty in space (state) and time, modeling the effect of tasks being completed contingent on meeting a certain condition at some random time instead of imposing specifications at fixed times. The present work is a study to extend Schr\"odinger's paradigm on such an issue, and herein, it is tackled in the context of random walks on directed graphs. Specifically, we study the case where one marginal is the initial probability distribution on a Markov chain, while others are marginals of stopping (first-arrival) times at absorbing states, signifying completion of tasks. We show when the prior law on paths is Markov, a Markov policy is once again optimal to satisfy those marginal constraints with respect to a likelihood cost following Schr\"odinger's dictum. Based on this, we present the mathematical formulation involving a Sinkhorn-type iteration to construct the optimal probability law on paths matching the spatio-temporal marginals.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

In particular, Saudi Arabia is gradually shifting its energy portfolio from an exclusive use of oil to a reliance on renewable energy, and, in particular, wind. Modeling wind for assessing potential energy output in a country as large, geographically diverse and understudied as Saudi Arabia is a challenge which implies highly non-linear dynamic structures in both space and time. To address this, we propose a spatio-temporal model whose spatial information is first reduced via an energy distance-based approach and then its dynamical behavior is informed by a sparse and stochastic recurrent neural network (Echo State Network). Finally, the full spatial data is reconstructed by means of a non-stationary stochastic partial differential equation-based approach. Our model can capture the fine scale wind structure and produce more accurate forecasts of both wind speed and energy in lead times of interest for energy grid management and save annually as much as one million dollar against the closest competitive model.</p></details> |  |

In this article, we propose a novel spatio-temporal model using a strategic modification of the Hamiltonian equations, incorporating appropriate stochasticity via Gaussian processes. The resultant spatio-temporal process, continuously varying with time, turns out to be nonparametric, non-stationary, non-separable, and non-Gaussian. Additionally, the lagged correlations converge to zero as the spatio-temporal lag goes to infinity. We investigate the theoretical properties of the new spatio-temporal process, including its continuity and smoothness properties. We derive methods for complete Bayesian inference using MCMC techniques in the Bayesian paradigm. The performance of our method has been compared with that of a non-stationary Gaussian process (GP) using two simulation studies, where our method shows a significant improvement over the non-stationary GP. Further, applying our new model to two real data sets revealed encouraging performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Anoth...</summary><p>Another updated version, demonstrating superiority of our ideas over existing ones</p></details> |

We present a comprehensive analysis of time integration methods, highlighting the adaptation of the two-step Adams-Bashforth scheme to enhance long-term prediction robustness in auto-regressive models. Additionally, we improve temporal prediction accuracy through a multi-step rollout strategy that incorporates multiple future time steps during training, supported by three newly proposed approaches that dynamically adjust the importance of each future step. By integrating the Adams-Bashforth scheme with adaptive multi-step strategies, our graph neural network-based auto-regressive model accurately predicts 350 future time steps, even under practical constraints such as limited training data and minimal model capacity -- achieving an error of only 1.6% compared to the vanilla auto-regressive approach. Moreover, our framework demonstrates an 83% improvement in rollout performance over the standard noise injection method, a standard technique for enhancing long-term rollout performance. Its effectiveness is further validated in more challenging scenarios with truncated meshes, showcasing its adaptability and robustness in practical applications. This work introduces a versatile framework for robust long-term spatio-temporal auto-regressive predictions, effectively mitigating error accumulation across various model types and engineering discipline.</p></details> |  |

Although many existing methods utilize multi-head attention mechanisms and message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to capture both spatial and temporal relations, these approaches encode temporal and spatial relations independently, and reflect the graph's topological characteristics in a limited manner. In this work, we introduce the Cycle to Mixer (Cy2Mixer), a novel spatio-temporal GNN based on topological non-trivial invariants of spatio-temporal graphs with gated multi-layer perceptrons (gMLP). The Cy2Mixer is composed of three blocks based on MLPs: A temporal block for capturing temporal properties, a message-passing block for encapsulating spatial information, and a cycle message-passing block for enriching topological information through cyclic subgraphs. We bolster the effectiveness of Cy2Mixer with mathematical evidence emphasizing that our cycle message-passing block is capable of offering differentiated information to the deep learning model compared to the message-passing block. Furthermore, empirical evaluations substantiate the efficacy of the Cy2Mixer, demonstrating state-of-the-art performances across various spatio-temporal benchmark datasets.

| **[Spatio-Temporal Context Prompting for Zero-Shot Action Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15996v3)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal action detection encompasses the tasks of localizing and classifying individual actions within a video. Recent works aim to enhance this process by incorporating interaction modeling, which captures the relationship between people and their surrounding context. However, these approaches have primarily focused on fully-supervised learning, and the current limitation lies in the lack of generalization capability to recognize unseen action categories. In this paper, we aim to adapt the pretrained image-language models to detect unseen actions. To this end, we propose a method which can effectively leverage the rich knowledge of visual-language models to perform Person-Context Interaction. Meanwhile, our Context Prompting module will utilize contextual information to prompt labels, thereby enhancing the generation of more representative text features. Moreover, to address the challenge of recognizing distinct actions by multiple people at the same timestamp, we design the Interest Token Spotting mechanism which employs pretrained visual knowledge to find each person's interest context tokens, and then these tokens will be used for prompting to generate text features tailored to each individual. To evaluate the ability to detect unseen actions, we propose a comprehensive benchmark on J-HMDB, UCF101-24, and AVA datasets. The experiments show that our method achieves superior results compared to previous approaches and can be further extended to multi-action videos, bringing it closer to real-world applications.

| **[A Spatio-Temporal Representation Learning as an Alternative to Traditional Glosses in Sign Language Translation and Production](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02854v2)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the challenges associated with the use of glosses in both Sign Language Translation (SLT) and Sign Language Production (SLP). While glosses have long been used as a bridge between sign language and spoken language, they come with two major limitations that impede the advancement of sign language systems. First, annotating the glosses is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process, which limits the scalability of datasets. Second, the glosses oversimplify sign language by stripping away its spatio-temporal dynamics, reducing complex signs to basic labels and missing the subtle movements essential for precise interpretation. To address these limitations, we introduce Universal Gloss-level Representation (UniGloR), a framework designed to capture the spatio-temporal features inherent in sign language, providing a more dynamic and detailed alternative to the use of the glosses. The core idea of UniGloR is simple yet effective: We derive dense spatio-temporal representations from sign keypoint sequences using self-supervised learning and seamlessly integrate them into SLT and SLP tasks. Our experiments in a keypoint-based setting demonstrate that UniGloR either outperforms or matches the performance of previous SLT and SLP methods on two widely-used datasets: PHOENIX14T and How2Sign.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Semi-decentralized Training of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03188v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In smart mobility, large networks of geographically distributed sensors produce vast amounts of high-frequency spatio-temporal data that must be processed in real time to avoid major disruptions. Traditional centralized approaches are increasingly unsuitable to this task, as they struggle to scale with expanding sensor networks, and reliability issues in central components can easily affect the whole deployment. To address these challenges, we explore and adapt semi-decentralized training techniques for Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) in smart mobility domain. We implement a simulation framework where sensors are grouped by proximity into multiple cloudlets, each handling a subgraph of the traffic graph, fetching node features from other cloudlets to train its own local ST-GNN model, and exchanging model updates with other cloudlets to ensure consistency, enhancing scalability and removing reliance on a centralized aggregator. We perform extensive comparative evaluation of four different ST-GNN training setups -- centralized, traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning -- on large-scale traffic datasets, the METR-LA and PeMS-BAY datasets, for short-, mid-, and long-term vehicle speed predictions. Experimental results show that semi-decentralized setups are comparable to centralized approaches in performance metrics, while offering advantages in terms of scalability and fault tolerance. In addition, we highlight often overlooked issues in existing literature for distributed ST-GNNs, such as the variation in model performance across different geographical areas due to region-specific traffic patterns, and the significant communication overhead and computational costs that arise from the large receptive field of GNNs, leading to substantial data transfers and increased computation of partial embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, conference</p></details> |

Since such datasets are often incomplete and noisy, it is useful to create the prediction surface of a spatial field. To this end, we consider an online filtering inference by using the Kalman filter based on linear Gaussian state-space models. However, the Kalman filter is impractically time-consuming when the number of locations in spatio-temporal datasets is large. To address this problem, we propose a multi-resolution filter via linear projection (MRF-lp), a fast computation method for online filtering inference. In the MRF-lp, by carrying out a multi-resolution approximation via linear projection (MRA-lp), the forecast covariance matrix can be approximated while capturing both the large- and small-scale spatial variations. As a result of this approximation, our proposed MRF-lp preserves a block-sparse structure of some matrices appearing in the MRF-lp through time, which leads to the scalability of this algorithm. Additionally, we discuss extensions of the MRF-lp to a nonlinear and non-Gaussian case. Simulation studies and real data analysis for total precipitable water vapor demonstrate that our proposed approach performs well compared with the related methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, 10 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we utilise statistical spatio-temporal methods to combine data from various sources and resolutions, aiming to accurately model krill abundance. Our focus lies in fitting the model to a dataset comprising acoustic measurements of krill biomass. To achieve this, we integrate climate covariates obtained from satellite imagery and from drifting surface buoys (also known as drifters). Additionally, we use sparsely collected krill biomass data obtained from net fishing efforts (KRILLBASE) for validation. However, integrating these multiple heterogeneous data sources presents significant modelling challenges, including spatio-temporal misalignment and inflated zeros in the observed data. To address these challenges, we fit a Hurdle-Gamma model to jointly describe the occurrence of zeros and the krill biomass for the non-zero observations, while also accounting for misaligned and heterogeneous data sources, including drifters. Therefore, our work presents a comprehensive framework for analysing and predicting krill abundance in the Southern Ocean, leveraging information from various sources and formats. This is crucial due to the impact of krill fishing, as understanding their distribution is essential for informed management decisions and fishing regulations aimed at protecting the species.</p></details> |  |
| **[STEP: Enhancing Video-LLMs' Compositional Reasoning by Spatio-Temporal Graph-guided Self-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00161v1)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have recently shown strong performance in basic video understanding tasks, such as captioning and coarse-grained question answering, but struggle with compositional reasoning that requires multi-step spatio-temporal inference across object relations, interactions, and events. The hurdles to enhancing this capability include extensive manual labor, the lack of spatio-temporal compositionality in existing data and the absence of explicit reasoning supervision. In this paper, we propose STEP, a novel graph-guided self-training method that enables Video-LLMs to generate reasoning-rich fine-tuning data from any raw videos to improve itself. Specifically, we first induce Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph (STSG) representation of diverse videos to capture fine-grained, multi-granular video semantics. Then, the STSGs guide the derivation of multi-step reasoning Question-Answer (QA) data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales. Both answers and rationales are integrated as training objective, aiming to enhance model's reasoning abilities by supervision over explicit reasoning steps. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of STEP across models of varying scales, with a significant 21.3\% improvement in tasks requiring three or more reasoning steps. Furthermore, it achieves superior performance with a minimal amount of self-generated rationale-enriched training samples in both compositional reasoning and comprehensive understanding benchmarks, highlighting the broad applicability and vast potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[STANet: A Novel Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network for Depression Classification with Small and Unbalanced FMRI Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21323v2)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate diagnosis of depression is crucial for timely implementation of optimal treatments, preventing complications and reducing the risk of suicide. Traditional methods rely on self-report questionnaires and clinical assessment, lacking objective biomarkers. Combining fMRI with artificial intelligence can enhance depression diagnosis by integrating neuroimaging indicators. However, the specificity of fMRI acquisition for depression often results in unbalanced and small datasets, challenging the sensitivity and accuracy of classification models. In this study, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network (STANet) for diagnosing depression by integrating CNN and RNN to capture both temporal and spatial features of brain activity. STANet comprises the following steps:(1) Aggregate spatio-temporal information via ICA. (2) Utilize multi-scale deep convolution to capture detailed features. (3) Balance data using the SMOTE to generate new samples for minority classes. (4) Employ the AFGRU classifier, which combines Fourier transformation with GRU, to capture long-term dependencies, with an adaptive weight assignment mechanism to enhance model generalization. The experimental results demonstrate that STANet achieves superior depression diagnostic performance with 82.38% accuracy and a 90.72% AUC. The STFA module enhances classification by capturing deeper features at multiple scales. The AFGRU classifier, with adaptive weights and stacked GRU, attains higher accuracy and AUC. SMOTE outperforms other oversampling methods. Additionally, spatio-temporal aggregated features achieve better performance compared to using only temporal or spatial features. STANet outperforms traditional or deep learning classifiers, and functional connectivity-based classifiers, as demonstrated by ten-fold cross-validation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is published on Tomography</p></details> |

We are the first to propose a new benchmark for multi-person spatio-temporal complex activity localization, where complex semantic and long duration bring new challenges to localization tasks. We observe that limited atomic actions can be combined into many complex activities. MM-SEAL provides both atomic action and complex activity annotations, producing 111.7k atomic actions spanning 172 action categories and 17.7k complex activities spanning 200 activity categories. We explore the relationship between atomic actions and complex activities, finding that atomic action features can improve the complex activity localization performance. Also, we propose a new network which generates temporal proposals and labels simultaneously, termed Faster-TAD. Finally, our evaluations show that visual features pretrained on MM-SEAL can improve the performance on other action localization benchmarks. We will release the dataset and the project code upon publication of the paper.</p></details> | 17 pages,6 figures |
| **[Temporal Reversed Training for Spiking Neural Networks with Generalized Spatio-Temporal Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09108v2)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention as an ultra-low power computing paradigm. Recent studies have focused on improving the feature extraction capability of SNNs, but they suffer from inefficient inference and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective temporal reversed training (TRT) method to optimize the spatio-temporal performance of SNNs and circumvent these problems. We perturb the input temporal data by temporal reversal, prompting the SNN to produce original-reversed consistent outputs and to learn perturbation-invariant representations. For static data without temporal dimension, we generalize this strategy by exploiting the inherent temporal property of SNNs for spike feature temporal reversal. In addition, we utilize the lightweight ``star operation" (element-wise multiplication) to hybridize the original and temporally reversed spike firing rates and expand the implicit dimensions, which serves as spatio-temporal regularization to further enhance the generalization of the SNN. Our method involves only a temporal reversal operation and element-wise multiplication during training, thus incurring negligible training overhead and not affecting the inference efficiency at all. Extensive experiments on static/neuromorphic object/action recognition, and 3D point cloud classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method. In particular, with only two timesteps, our method achieves 74.77\% and 90.57\% accuracy on ImageNet and ModelNet40, respectively.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

Traditional hydrologic modeling approaches simulate streamflow by establishing connections across multiple physical processes, such as rainfall and runoff. These data, inherently connected both spatially and temporally, possess intrinsic causal relations that can be leveraged for robust and accurate forecasting. Recently, spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) have been adopted, excelling in various domains, such as urban traffic management, weather forecasting, and pandemic control, and they also promise advances in streamflow management. However, learning causal relationships directly from vast observational data is theoretically and computationally challenging. In this study, we employ a river flow graph as prior knowledge to facilitate the learning of the causal structure and then use the learned causal graph to predict streamflow at targeted sites. The proposed model, Causal Streamflow Forecasting (CSF) is tested in a real-world study in the Brazos River basin in Texas. Our results demonstrate that our method outperforms regular spatio-temporal graph neural networks and achieves higher computational efficiency compared to traditional simulation methods. By effectively integrating river flow graphs with STGNNs, this research offers a novel approach to streamflow prediction, showcasing the potential of combining advanced neural network techniques with domain-specific knowledge for enhanced performance in hydrologic modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published at IEEE Big Data 2024</p></details> |

However, existing methods, which rely on either spatial SMPL(-X) poses or temporal embeddings, respectively suffer from coarse rendering quality or limited animation flexibility. To address these challenges, we propose GAST, a framework that unifies 3D human modeling with 3DGS by hierarchically integrating both spatial and temporal information. Specifically, we design a sequential conditioning framework for the non-rigid warping of the human body, under whose guidance more accurate 3D Gaussians can be obtained in the observation space. Moreover, the explicit properties of Gaussians allow us to embed richer sequential information, encompassing both the coarse sequence of human poses and finer per-vertex motion details. These sequence conditions are further sampled across different temporal scales, in a coarse-to-fine manner, ensuring unbiased inputs for non-rigid warping. Experimental results demonstrate that our method combined with hierarchical spatio-temporal modeling surpasses concurrent baselines, delivering both high-quality rendering and flexible animating capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distribution-aware Online Continual Learning for Urban Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15893v1)** | 2024-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban spatio-temporal (ST) forecasting is crucial for various urban applications such as intelligent scheduling and trip planning. Previous studies focus on modeling ST correlations among urban locations in offline settings, which often neglect the non-stationary nature of urban ST data, particularly, distribution shifts over time. This oversight can lead to degraded performance in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we first analyze the distribution shifts in urban ST data, and then introduce DOST, a novel online continual learning framework tailored for ST data characteristics. DOST employs an adaptive ST network equipped with a variable-independent adapter to address the unique distribution shifts at each urban location dynamically. Further, to accommodate the gradual nature of these shifts, we also develop an awake-hibernate learning strategy that intermittently fine-tunes the adapter during the online phase to reduce computational overhead. This strategy integrates a streaming memory update mechanism designed for urban ST sequential data, enabling effective network adaptation to new patterns while preventing catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results confirm DOST's superiority over state-of-the-art models on four real-world datasets, providing online forecasts within an average of 0.1 seconds and achieving a 12.89% reduction in forecast errors compared to baseline models.</p></details> |  |

However, these networks often face challenges in training due to the high annotation cost. To address this, unsupervised and weakly-supervised methods have been developed to reduce the dependency on annotations. This work introduces a novel weakly-supervised method called Eigen-Cluster VIS that, without requiring any mask annotations, achieves competitive accuracy compared to other VIS approaches. This method is based on two key innovations: a Temporal Eigenvalue Loss (TEL) and a clip-level Quality Cluster Coefficient (QCC). The TEL ensures temporal coherence by leveraging the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix derived from graph adjacency matrices. By minimizing the mean absolute error between the eigenvalues of adjacent frames, this loss function promotes smooth transitions and stable segmentation boundaries over time, reducing temporal discontinuities and improving overall segmentation quality. The QCC employs the K-means method to ensure the quality of spatio-temporal clusters without relying on ground truth masks. Using the Davies-Bouldin score, the QCC provides an unsupervised measure of feature discrimination, allowing the model to self-evaluate and adapt to varying object distributions, enhancing robustness during the testing phase. These enhancements are computationally efficient and straightforward, offering significant performance gains without additional annotated data. The proposed Eigen-Cluster VIS method is evaluated on the YouTube-Video Instance Segmentation (YouTube-VIS) 2019/2021 and Occluded Video Instance Segmentation (OVIS) datasets, demonstrating that it effectively narrows the performance gap between the fully-supervised and weakly-supervised VIS approaches.

While the ERA5 reanalysis dataset provides consistent long-term global precipitation information that allows investigations of these impacts, it lacks the resolution to capture the high spatio-temporal variability of precipitation. ERA5 misses intense local rainfall events that are crucial drivers of devastating flooding - a critical limitation since extreme weather events become increasingly frequent. Here, we introduce spateGAN-ERA5, the first deep learning based spatio-temporal downscaling of precipitation data on a global scale. SpateGAN-ERA5 uses a conditional generative adversarial neural network (cGAN) that enhances the resolution of ERA5 precipitation data from 24 km and 1 hour to 2 km and 10 minutes, delivering high-resolution rainfall fields with realistic spatio-temporal patterns and accurate rain rate distribution including extremes. Its computational efficiency enables the generation of a large ensemble of solutions, addressing uncertainties inherent to the challenges of downscaling. Trained solely on data from Germany and validated in the US and Australia considering diverse climate zones, spateGAN-ERA5 demonstrates strong generalization indicating a robust global applicability. SpateGAN-ERA5 fulfils a critical need for high-resolution precipitation data in hydrological and meteorological research, offering new capabilities for flood risk assessment, AI-enhanced weather forecasting, and impact modelling to address climate-driven challenges worldwide.</p></details> |  |

This study focuses on using spatio-temporal disease mapping models to explore the temporal trends of IHD at the county level from 1999 to 2021. To manage the computational burden arising from the high-dimensional data, we employ scalable Bayesian models using a "divide and conquer" strategy. This approach allows for fast model fitting and serves as an efficient procedure for screening spatio-temporal patterns. Additionally, we analyze trends in four regional subdivisions, West, Midwest, South and Northeast, and in urban and rural areas. The dataset on IHD contains missing data, and we propose a procedure to impute the omitted information. The results show a slowdown in the decrease of IHD mortality in the US after 2014 with a slight increase noted after 2019. However, differences exists among the counties, the four big geographical regions, and rural and urban areas.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Spatio-Temporal Signal Recognition on Edge Devices Using PointLCA-Net](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14585v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly through deep learning architectures like PointNet, have transformed the processing of three-dimensional (3D) point clouds, significantly improving 3D object classification and segmentation tasks. While 3D point clouds provide detailed spatial information, spatio-temporal signals introduce a dynamic element that accounts for changes over time. However, applying deep learning techniques to spatio-temporal signals and deploying them on edge devices presents challenges, including real-time processing, memory capacity, and power consumption. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel approach that combines PointNet's feature extraction with the in-memory computing capabilities and energy efficiency of neuromorphic systems for spatio-temporal signal recognition. The proposed method consists of a two-stage process: in the first stage, PointNet extracts features from the spatio-temporal signals, which are then stored in non-volatile memristor crossbar arrays. In the second stage, these features are processed by a single-layer spiking neural encoder-decoder that employs the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for efficient encoding and classification. This work integrates the strengths of both PointNet and LCA, enhancing computational efficiency and energy performance on edge devices. PointLCA-Net achieves high recognition accuracy for spatio-temporal data with substantially lower energy burden during both inference and training than comparable approaches, thus advancing the deployment of advanced neural architectures in energy-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2411.00140</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Representation Learning on Road Networks and Grids with Spatio-Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14014v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory representation learning is a fundamental task for applications in fields including smart city, and urban planning, as it facilitates the utilization of trajectory data (e.g., vehicle movements) for various downstream applications, such as trajectory similarity computation or travel time estimation. This is achieved by learning low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional and raw trajectory data. However, existing methods for trajectory representation learning either rely on grid-based or road-based representations, which are inherently different and thus, could lose information contained in the other modality. Moreover, these methods overlook the dynamic nature of urban traffic, relying on static road network features rather than time varying traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose TIGR, a novel model designed to integrate grid and road network modalities while incorporating spatio-temporal dynamics to learn rich, general-purpose representations of trajectories. We evaluate TIGR on two realworld datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of combining both modalities by substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods, i.e., up to 43.22% for trajectory similarity, up to 16.65% for travel time estimation, and up to 10.16% for destination prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Unbiased and Robust Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph Generation and Anticipation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13059v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-Temporal Scene Graphs (STSGs) provide a concise and expressive representation of dynamic scenes by modelling objects and their evolving relationships over time. However, real-world visual relationships often exhibit a long-tailed distribution, causing existing methods for tasks like Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) and Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) to produce biased scene graphs. To this end, we propose ImparTail, a novel training framework that leverages curriculum learning and loss masking to mitigate bias in the generation and anticipation of spatio-temporal scene graphs. Our approach gradually decreases the dominance of the head relationship classes during training and focuses more on tail classes, leading to more balanced training. Furthermore, we introduce two new tasks, Robust Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph Generation and Robust Scene Graph Anticipation, designed to evaluate the robustness of STSG models against distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on the Action Genome dataset demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the unbiased performance and robustness of STSG models compared to existing methods.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[A Foundation Model for Unified Urban Spatio-Temporal Flow Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12972v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban spatio-temporal flow prediction, encompassing traffic flows and crowd flows, is crucial for optimizing city infrastructure and managing traffic and emergency responses. Traditional approaches have relied on separate models tailored to either grid-based data, representing cities as uniform cells, or graph-based data, modeling cities as networks of nodes and edges. In this paper, we build UniFlow, a foundational model for general urban flow prediction that unifies both grid-based and graphbased data. We first design a multi-view spatio-temporal patching mechanism to standardize different data into a consistent sequential format and then introduce a spatio-temporal transformer architecture to capture complex correlations and dynamics. To leverage shared spatio-temporal patterns across different data types and facilitate effective cross-learning, we propose SpatioTemporal Memory Retrieval Augmentation (ST-MRA). By creating structured memory modules to store shared spatio-temporal patterns, ST-MRA enhances predictions through adaptive memory retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniFlow outperforms existing models in both grid-based and graph-based flow prediction, excelling particularly in scenarios with limited data availability, showcasing its superior performance and broad applicability. The datasets and code implementation have been released on https://github.com/YuanYuan98/UniFlow.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Uncertainty Quantification for Distributed Energy Adoption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12193v1)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid deployment of distributed energy resources (DER) has introduced significant spatio-temporal uncertainties in power grid management, necessitating accurate multilevel forecasting methods. However, existing approaches often produce overly conservative uncertainty intervals at individual spatial units and fail to properly capture uncertainties when aggregating predictions across different spatial scales. This paper presents a novel hierarchical spatio-temporal model based on the conformal prediction framework to address these challenges. Our approach generates circuit-level DER growth predictions and efficiently aggregates them to the substation level while maintaining statistical validity through a tailored non-conformity score. Applied to a decade of DER installation data from a local utility network, our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches, particularly in reducing prediction interval widths while maintaining coverage.</p></details> |  |

Effectively modeling these dynamics is essential for understanding and optimizing urban systems In this work, we introduce UrbanDiT, a foundation model for open-world urban spatio-temporal learning that successfully scale up diffusion transformers in this field. UrbanDiT pioneers a unified model that integrates diverse spatio-temporal data sources and types while learning universal spatio-temporal patterns across different cities and scenarios. This allows the model to unify both multi-data and multi-task learning, and effectively support a wide range of spatio-temporal applications. Its key innovation lies in the elaborated prompt learning framework, which adaptively generates both data-driven and task-specific prompts, guiding the model to deliver superior performance across various urban applications. UrbanDiT offers three primary advantages: 1) It unifies diverse data types, such as grid-based and graph-based data, into a sequential format, allowing to capture spatio-temporal dynamics across diverse scenarios of different cities; 2) With masking strategies and task-specific prompts, it supports a wide range of tasks, including bi-directional spatio-temporal prediction, temporal interpolation, spatial extrapolation, and spatio-temporal imputation; and 3) It generalizes effectively to open-world scenarios, with its powerful zero-shot capabilities outperforming nearly all baselines with training data. These features allow UrbanDiT to achieves state-of-the-art performance in different domains such as transportation traffic, crowd flows, taxi demand, bike usage, and cellular traffic, across multiple cities and tasks. UrbanDiT sets up a new benchmark for foundation models in the urban spatio-temporal domain.</p></details> |  |

This paper advances the analysis of such spatio-spherical data by developing convolutional network layers that are equivariant to the $\mathbf{E(3) \times SO(3)}$ group and account for the physical symmetries of dMRI including rotations, translations, and reflections of space alongside voxel-wise rotations. Further, neuronal fibers are typically antipodally symmetric, a fact we leverage to construct highly efficient spatio-hemispherical graph convolutions to accelerate the analysis of high-dimensional dMRI data. In the context of sparse spherical fiber deconvolution to recover white matter microstructure, our proposed equivariant network layers yield substantial performance and efficiency gains, leading to better and more practical resolution of crossing neuronal fibers and fiber tractography. These gains are experimentally consistent across both simulation and in vivo human datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024. 24 pages with 13 figures.

Existing thermal comfort models usually overlook temporal dynamics alongside spatial dependencies. We address this problem by introducing a spatio-temporal jump model that clusters data with persistence across both spatial and temporal dimensions. This framework enhances interpretability, minimizes abrupt state changes, and easily handles missing data. We validate our approach through extensive simulations, demonstrating its accuracy in recovering the true underlying partition. When applied to hourly environmental data gathered from a set of weather stations located across the city of Singapore, our proposal identifies meaningful thermal comfort regimes, demonstrating its effectiveness in dynamic urban settings and suitability for real-world monitoring. The comparison of these regimes with feedback on thermal preference indicates the potential of an unsupervised approach to avoid extensive surveys.</p></details> |  |

These patterns vary in color, shape, and location across video frames, posing challenges in extracting information from adjacent frames and preserving temporal consistency throughout the restoration process. Existing deep learning methods often depend on well-designed alignment modules, such as optical flow estimation, deformable convolution, and cross-frame self-attention layers, incurring high computational costs. Recent studies indicate that utilizing raw data as input can significantly improve the effectiveness of video demoireing by providing the pristine degradation information and more detailed content. However, previous works fail to design both efficient and effective raw video demoireing methods that can maintain temporal consistency and prevent degradation of color and spatial details. This paper introduces a novel alignment-free raw video demoireing network with frequency-assisted spatio-temporal Mamba (DemMamba). It features sequentially arranged Spatial Mamba Blocks (SMB) and Temporal Mamba Blocks (TMB) to effectively model the inter- and intra-relationships in raw videos affected by moire patterns. An Adaptive Frequency Block (AFB) within the SMB facilitates demoireing in the frequency domain, while a Channel Attention Block (CAB) in the TMB enhances the temporal information interactions by leveraging inter-channel relationships among features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DemMamba surpasses state-of-the-art methods by 1.3 dB in PSNR, and also provides a satisfactory visual experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[STLight: a Fully Convolutional Approach for Efficient Predictive Learning by Spatio-Temporal joint Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10198v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-Temporal predictive Learning is a self-supervised learning paradigm that enables models to identify spatial and temporal patterns by predicting future frames based on past frames. Traditional methods, which use recurrent neural networks to capture temporal patterns, have proven their effectiveness but come with high system complexity and computational demand. Convolutions could offer a more efficient alternative but are limited by their characteristic of treating all previous frames equally, resulting in poor temporal characterization, and by their local receptive field, limiting the capacity to capture distant correlations among frames. In this paper, we propose STLight, a novel method for spatio-temporal learning that relies solely on channel-wise and depth-wise convolutions as learnable layers. STLight overcomes the limitations of traditional convolutional approaches by rearranging spatial and temporal dimensions together, using a single convolution to mix both types of features into a comprehensive spatio-temporal patch representation. This representation is then processed in a purely convolutional framework, capable of focusing simultaneously on the interaction among near and distant patches, and subsequently allowing for efficient reconstruction of the predicted frames. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on STL benchmarks across different datasets and settings, while significantly improving computational efficiency in terms of parameters and computational FLOPs.

Predicting these extreme events remains challenging, as their complex interactions with large-scale atmospheric and climatic variables are difficult to capture with traditional statistical and dynamical models. This work presents a general method for driver identification in extreme climate events. A novel framework (STCO-FS) is proposed to identify key immediate (short-term) HW drivers by combining clustering algorithms with an ensemble evolutionary algorithm. The framework analyzes spatio-temporal data, reduces dimensionality by grouping similar geographical nodes for each variable, and develops driver selection in spatial and temporal domains, identifying the best time lags between predictive variables and HW occurrences. The proposed method has been applied to analyze HWs in the Adda river basin in Italy. The approach effectively identifies significant variables influencing HWs in this region. This research can potentially enhance our understanding of HW drivers and predictability.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we demonstrate that effective information compression may occur over time or space during sequences of node communications in distributed algorithms, leading to the concept of spatio-temporal compressors. This abstraction classifies existing compressors as spatio-temporal compressors, with their effectiveness described by constructive stability criteria from nonlinear system theory. Subsequently, we apply these spatio-temporal compressors to standard continuous-time consensus flows and distributed prime-dual flows, establishing conditions ensuring convergence. Additionally, we introduce a novel observer-based distributed primal-dual continuous flow integrated with spatio-temporal compressors, which provides broader convergence conditions. These continuous flows achieve exponential convergence to the global optimum when the objective function is strongly convex and can be discretized using Euler approximations. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the versatility of the proposed spatio-temporal compressors and verify the convergence of algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2408.02332</p></details> |

The central aim of multi-agent optimization is for a network of agents to collaboratively solve a system-level optimization problem with local objective functions and node-to-node communication by distributed algorithms. The scalability of such algorithms crucially depends on the complexity of the communication messages, and a number of communication compressors for distributed optimization have recently been proposed in the literature. First of all, we introduce a general spatio-temporal compressor characterized by the stability of the resulting dynamical system along the vector field of the compressor. We show that several important distributed optimization compressors such as the greedy sparsifier, the uniform quantizer, and the scalarizer all fall into the category of this spatio-temporal compressor. Next, we propose two distributed prime-dual flows with the spatio-temporal compressors being applied to local node states and local error states, respectively, and prove (exponential) convergence of the node trajectories to the global optimizer for (strongly) convex cost functions. Finally, a few numerical examples are present to illustrate our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |

Most of the existing models achieve either spectral or spatial compression, and do not jointly consider the spatio-spectral redundancies present in HSIs. To address this problem, in this paper we focus our attention on the High Fidelity Compression (HiFiC) model (which is proven to be highly effective for spatial compression problems) and adapt it to perform spatio-spectral compression of HSIs. In detail, we introduce two new models: i) HiFiC using Squeeze and Excitation (SE) blocks (denoted as HiFiC$_{SE}$); and ii) HiFiC with 3D convolutions (denoted as HiFiC$_{3D}$) in the framework of compression of HSIs. We analyze the effectiveness of HiFiC$_{SE}$ and HiFiC$_{3D}$ in compressing the spatio-spectral redundancies with channel attention and inter-dependency analysis. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed models in performing spatio-spectral compression, while reconstructing images at reduced bitrates with higher reconstruction quality.

To efficiently handle TkQs, many indexes have been developed, but the effectiveness of TkQ is limited. To improve effectiveness, several deep learning models have recently been proposed, but they suffer severe efficiency issues and there are no efficient indexes specifically designed to accelerate the top-k search process for these deep learning models. To tackle these issues, we consider embedding based spatial keyword queries, which capture the semantic meaning of query keywords and object descriptions in two separate embeddings to evaluate textual relevance. Although various models can be used to generate these embeddings, no indexes have been specifically designed for such queries. To fill this gap, we propose LIST, a novel machine learning based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search index that Learns to Index the Spatio-Textual data. LIST utilizes a new learning-to-cluster technique to group relevant queries and objects together while separating irrelevant queries and objects. There are two key challenges in building an effective and efficient index, i.e., the absence of high-quality labels and the unbalanced clustering results. We develop a novel pseudo-label generation technique to address the two challenges. Additionally, we introduce a learning based spatial relevance model that can integrates with various text relevance models to form a lightweight yet effective relevance for reranking objects retrieved by LIST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VLDB Journal</p></details> |

Existing approaches often address these dimensions in isolation, neglecting their critical interdependencies. In this paper, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Unitized Model (STUM), a unified framework designed to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies while addressing spatio-temporal heterogeneity through techniques such as distribution alignment and feature fusion. It also ensures both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. Central to STUM is the Adaptive Spatio-temporal Unitized Cell (ASTUC), which utilizes low-rank matrices to seamlessly store, update, and interact with space, time, as well as their correlations. Our framework is also modular, allowing it to integrate with various spatio-temporal graph neural networks through components such as backbone models, feature extractors, residual fusion blocks, and predictive modules to collectively enhance forecasting outcomes. Experimental results across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that STUM consistently improves prediction performance with minimal computational cost. These findings are further supported by hyperparameter optimization, pre-training analysis, and result visualization. We provide our source code for reproducibility at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/STUM-E4F0.</p></details> |  |

However, current approaches often struggle to capture important spatio-temporal relationships, particularly overlooking global relations among distant city regions. Most existing techniques predominantly rely on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to capture global relations. However, CNNs exhibit neighbourhood bias, making them insufficient for capturing distant relations. To address this limitation, we propose ST-SampleNet, a novel transformer-based architecture that combines CNNs with self-attention mechanisms to capture both local and global relations effectively. Moreover, as the number of regions increases, the quadratic complexity of self-attention becomes a challenge. To tackle this issue, we introduce a lightweight region sampling strategy that prunes non-essential regions and enhances the efficiency of our approach. Furthermore, we introduce a spatially constrained position embedding that incorporates spatial neighbourhood information into the self-attention mechanism, aiding in semantic interpretation and improving the performance of ST-SampleNet. Our experimental evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of ST-SampleNet. Additionally, our efficient variant achieves a 40% reduction in computational costs with only a marginal compromise in performance, approximately 1%.</p></details> |  |

However, most current systems assume a static environment, which limits the system's applicability in real-world scenarios where environments frequently change due to human intervention or the robot's own actions. In this work, we present DynaMem, a new approach to open-world mobile manipulation that uses a dynamic spatio-semantic memory to represent a robot's environment. DynaMem constructs a 3D data structure to maintain a dynamic memory of point clouds, and answers open-vocabulary object localization queries using multimodal LLMs or open-vocabulary features generated by state-of-the-art vision-language models.

Yet, their performance is constrained by the reliance on extensive data for training on a specific task, thereby limiting their adaptability to new urban domains with varied task demands. Although transfer learning has been proposed to remedy this problem by leveraging knowledge across domains, the cross-task generalization still remains under-explored in spatio-temporal graph transfer learning due to the lack of a unified framework. To bridge the gap, we propose Spatio-Temporal Graph Prompting (STGP), a prompt-based framework capable of adapting to multi-diverse tasks in a data-scarce domain. Specifically, we first unify different tasks into a single template and introduce a task-agnostic network architecture that aligns with this template. This approach enables capturing dependencies shared across tasks. Furthermore, we employ learnable prompts to achieve domain and task transfer in a two-stage prompting pipeline, facilitating the prompts to effectively capture domain knowledge and task-specific properties. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that STGP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in three tasks-forecasting, kriging, and extrapolation-achieving an improvement of up to 10.7%.</p></details> |  |

Instead, we focus on geometric deep learning using graph neural networks, aiming to build a spatio-temporal graph neural network that learns from thickness information of the top ice layers and predicts for deeper layers. In this paper, we developed a novel multi-branch spatio-temporal graph neural network that used the GraphSAGE framework for spatio features learning and a temporal convolution operation to capture temporal changes, enabling different branches of the network to be more specialized and focusing on a single learning task.

This perspective considers spatio-temporal dynamics unitedly and reformulates multi-person motion prediction into a problem on a single graph. Leveraging the dynamic message passing based on this hypergraph, our model dynamically learns from both types of relations to generate targeted messages that reflect the relevance among nodes.

HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, which meet the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges, such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STAD) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which then used as conditional inputs to direct the reverse denoising process. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the STAD significantly enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STAD demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks, indicating their potential to Substantially boost the spatial resolution of EEG.</p></details> |  |

Our approach captures temporal and feature dependencies within a unified spatio-temporal pipeline by leveraging a GCNN that uses a spatio-temporal graph aimed at optimizing predictive accuracy and interoperability. For graph estimation, we introduce techniques, including one based on the (heterogeneous) Gower distance. Once estimated, we propose two methods for graph construction: one based on the Cartesian product, treating temporal instants homogeneously, and another spatio-temporal approach with distinct graphs per time step. We also propose two GCNN architectures: a standard GCNN with a normalized adjacency matrix and a higher-order polynomial GCNN. In addition to accuracy, we emphasize explainability by designing an inherently interpretable model and performing a thorough interpretability analysis, identifying key feature-time combinations that drive predictions. We evaluate XST-GCNN using real-world Electronic Health Record data from University Hospital of Fuenlabrada to predict Multidrug Resistance (MDR) in ICU patients, a critical healthcare challenge linked to high mortality and complex treatments.

| **[STAA: Spatio-Temporal Attention Attribution for Real-Time Interpreting Transformer-based Video Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00630v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various computer vision tasks, including image and video analysis. However, Transformer's complex architecture and black-box nature pose challenges for explainability, a crucial aspect for real-world applications and scientific inquiry. Current Explainable AI (XAI) methods can only provide one-dimensional feature importance, either spatial or temporal explanation, with significant computational complexity. This paper introduces STAA (Spatio-Temporal Attention Attribution), an XAI method for interpreting video Transformer models. Differ from traditional methods that separately apply image XAI techniques for spatial features or segment contribution analysis for temporal aspects, STAA offers both spatial and temporal information simultaneously from attention values in Transformers. The study utilizes the Kinetics-400 dataset, a benchmark collection of 400 human action classes used for action recognition research. We introduce metrics to quantify explanations. We also apply optimization to enhance STAA's raw output. By implementing dynamic thresholding and attention focusing mechanisms, we improve the signal-to-noise ratio in our explanations, resulting in more precise visualizations and better evaluation results. In terms of computational overhead, our method requires less than 3\% of the computational resources of traditional XAI methods, making it suitable for real-time video XAI analysis applications. STAA contributes to the growing field of XAI by offering a method for researchers and practitioners to analyze Transformer models.</p></details> |  |

Current state-of-the-art methods either require multiple independent stages of processing that employ motion cues or, in the case of end-to-end trainable networks, lack in segmentation accuracy, in part due to the difficulty of learning segmentation maps from videos with transient object presence. This limits the application of WSVOS for semantic annotation of surgical videos where multiple surgical tools frequently move in and out of the field of view, a problem that is more difficult than typically encountered in WSVOS. This paper introduces Video Spatio-Temporal Disentanglement Networks (VDST-Net), a framework to disentangle spatiotemporal information using semi-decoupled knowledge distillation to predict high-quality class activation maps (CAMs). A teacher network designed to resolve temporal conflicts when specifics about object location and timing in the video are not provided works with a student network that integrates information over time by leveraging temporal dependencies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on a public reference dataset and on a more challenging surgical video dataset where objects are, on average, present in less than 60\% of annotated frames. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and generates superior segmentation masks under video-level weak supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)</p></details> |

If these components are found, they can be modelled univariately. Blind source separation aims to recover the latent components by estimating the unmixing transformation based on the observed data only. The current methods for spatio-temporal blind source separation are restricted to linear unmixing, and nonlinear variants have not been implemented. In this paper, we extend identifiable variational autoencoder to the nonlinear nonstationary spatio-temporal blind source separation setting and demonstrate its performance using comprehensive simulation studies. Additionally, we introduce two alternative methods for the latent dimension estimation, which is a crucial task in order to obtain the correct latent representation. Finally, we illustrate the proposed methods using a meteorological application, where we estimate the latent dimension and the latent components, interpret the components, and show how nonstationarity can be accounted and prediction accuracy can be improved by using the proposed nonlinear blind source separation method as a preprocessing method.</p></details> |  |

This is because whole sequence segmentation is currently a tedious process and inaccurate. Conventional whole sequence segmentation approaches first estimate the motion field between frames, which is then used to propagate the mask along the temporal axis. However, the mask propagation results could be prone to error, especially for the basal and apex slices, where through-plane motion leads to significant morphology and structural change during the cardiac cycle. Inspired by recent advances in video object segmentation (VOS), based on spatio-temporal memory (STM) networks, we propose a continuous STM (CSTM) network for semi-supervised whole heart and whole sequence cMR segmentation. Our CSTM network takes full advantage of the spatial, scale, temporal and through-plane continuity prior of the underlying heart anatomy structures, to achieve accurate and fast 4D segmentation. Results of extensive experiments across multiple cMR datasets show that our method can improve the 4D cMR segmentation performance, especially for the hard-to-segment regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Identifying Spatio-Temporal Drivers of Extreme Events](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24075v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spatio-temporal relations of impacts of extreme events and their drivers in climate data are not fully understood and there is a need of machine learning approaches to identify such spatio-temporal relations from data. The task, however, is very challenging since there are time delays between extremes and their drivers, and the spatial response of such drivers is inhomogeneous. In this work, we propose a first approach and benchmarks to tackle this challenge. Our approach is trained end-to-end to predict spatio-temporally extremes and spatio-temporally drivers in the physical input variables jointly. By enforcing the network to predict extremes from spatio-temporal binary masks of identified drivers, the network successfully identifies drivers that are correlated with extremes. We evaluate our approach on three newly created synthetic benchmarks, where two of them are based on remote sensing or reanalysis climate data, and on two real-world reanalysis datasets.

Recently, transformer based models have shown remarkable potential in weather forecasting achieving state-of-the-art results. However, transformers are discrete and physics-agnostic models which limit their ability to learn the continuous spatio-temporal features of the dynamical weather system. We address this issue with STC-ViT, a Spatio-Temporal Continuous Vision Transformer for weather forecasting. STC-ViT incorporates the continuous time Neural ODE layers with multi-head attention mechanism to learn the continuous weather evolution over time. The attention mechanism is encoded as a differentiable function in the transformer architecture to model the complex weather dynamics. Further, we define a customised physics informed loss for STC-ViT which penalize the model's predictions for deviating away from physical laws. We evaluate STC-ViT against operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model and several deep learning based weather forecasting models. STC-ViT, trained on 1.5-degree 6-hourly data, demonstrates computational efficiency and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art data-driven models trained on higher-resolution data for global forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Deciphering and Inpainting in Spatio-Temporal Dynamics via Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19608v2)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal (ST) prediction has garnered a De facto attention in earth sciences, such as meteorological prediction, human mobility perception. However, the scarcity of data coupled with the high expenses involved in sensor deployment results in notable data imbalances. Furthermore, models that are excessively customized and devoid of causal connections further undermine the generalizability and interpretability. To this end, we establish a causal framework for ST predictions, termed CaPaint, which targets to identify causal regions in data and endow model with causal reasoning ability in a two-stage process. Going beyond this process, we utilize the back-door adjustment to specifically address the sub-regions identified as non-causal in the upstream phase. Specifically, we employ a novel image inpainting technique. By using a fine-tuned unconditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as the generative prior, we in-fill the masks defined as environmental parts, offering the possibility of reliable extrapolation for potential data distributions. CaPaint overcomes the high complexity dilemma of optimal ST causal discovery models by reducing the data generation complexity from exponential to quasi-linear levels. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world ST benchmarks demonstrate that integrating the CaPaint concept allows models to achieve improvements ranging from 4.3% to 77.3%. Moreover, compared to traditional mainstream ST augmenters, CaPaint underscores the potential of diffusion models in ST enhancement, offering a novel paradigm for this field.

| **[An Overtaking Trajectory Planning Framework Based on Spatio-temporal Topology and Reachable Set Analysis Ensuring Time Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22643v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating overtaking trajectories in high-speed scenarios presents significant challenges and is typically addressed through hierarchical planning methods. However, this method has two primary drawbacks. First, heuristic algorithms can only provide a single initial solution, which may lead to local optima and consequently diminish the quality of the solution. Second, the time efficiency of trajectory refinement based on numerical optimization is insufficient. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an overtaking trajectory planning framework based on spatio-temporal topology and reachable set analysis (SROP), to improve trajectory quality and time efficiency. Specifically, this paper introduces topological classes to describe trajectories representing different overtaking behaviors, which support the spatio-temporal topological search method employed by the upper-layer planner to identify diverse initial paths. This approach helps prevent getting stuck in local optima, enhancing the overall solution quality by considering multiple initial solutions from distinct topologies. Moreover, the reachable set method is integrated into the lower-layer planner for parallel trajectory evaluation. This method enhances planning efficiency by decoupling vehicle model constraints from the optimization process, enabling parallel computation while ensuring control feasibility. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves the smoothness of generated trajectories by 66.8% compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing trajectory quality. Additionally, this method reduces computation time by 62.9%, demonstrating its efficiency.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Hierarchical Framework with Spatio-Temporal Consistency Learning for Emergence Detection in Complex Adaptive Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10300v2)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emergence, a global property of complex adaptive systems (CASs) constituted by interactive agents, is prevalent in real-world dynamic systems, e.g., network-level traffic congestions. Detecting its formation and evaporation helps to monitor the state of a system, allowing to issue a warning signal for harmful emergent phenomena. Since there is no centralized controller of CAS, detecting emergence based on each agent's local observation is desirable but challenging. Existing works are unable to capture emergence-related spatial patterns, and fail to model the nonlinear relationships among agents. This paper proposes a hierarchical framework with spatio-temporal consistency learning to solve these two problems by learning the system representation and agent representations, respectively. Spatio-temporal encoders composed of spatial and temporal transformers are designed to capture agents' nonlinear relationships and the system's complex evolution. Agents' and the system's representations are learned to preserve the spatio-temporal consistency by minimizing the spatial and temporal dissimilarities in a self-supervised manner in the latent space. Our method achieves more accurate detection than traditional methods and deep learning methods on three datasets with well-known yet hard-to-detect emergent behaviors. Notably, our hierarchical framework is generic in incorporating other deep learning methods for agent-level and system-level detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, accepted by IEEE TNNLS</p></details> |
| **[DeepMIDE: A Multivariate Spatio-Temporal Method for Ultra-Scale Offshore Wind Energy Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20166v1)** | 2024-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To unlock access to stronger winds, the offshore wind industry is advancing with significantly larger and taller wind turbines. This massive upscaling motivates a departure from univariate wind forecasting methods that traditionally focused on a single representative height. To fill this gap, we propose DeepMIDE--a statistical deep learning method which jointly models the offshore wind speeds across space, time, and height. DeepMIDE is formulated as a multi-output integro-difference equation model with a multivariate, nonstationary, and state-dependent kernel characterized by a set of advection vectors that encode the physics of wind field formation and propagation. Embedded within DeepMIDE, an advanced deep learning architecture learns these advection vectors from high dimensional streams of exogenous weather information, which, along with other parameters, are plugged back into the statistical model for probabilistic multi-height space-time forecasting. Tested on real-world data from future offshore wind energy sites in the Northeastern United States, the wind speed and power forecasts from DeepMIDE are shown to outperform those from prevalent time series, spatio-temporal, and deep learning methods.</p></details> |  |

Computations are done through a Gaussian Markov random field approximation of the solution of the SPDE, which is constructed through a finite volume method. The new flexible non-separable model is compared to a flexible separable model both for reconstruction and forecasting, and evaluated in terms of root mean square errors and continuous rank probability scores. A simulation study demonstrates that the non-separable model performs better when the data is simulated from a non-separable model with diffusion and advection. Further, we estimate surrogate models for emulating the output of a ocean model in Trondheimsfjorden, Norway, and simulate observations of autonomous underwater vehicles. The results show that the flexible non-separable model outperforms the flexible separable model for real-time prediction of unobserved locations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Spatio-temporal Estimation on the Graph Edges via Line Graph Transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00656v3)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal estimation of signals on graph edges is challenging because most conventional Graph Signal Processing techniques are defined on the graph nodes. Leveraging the Line Graph transform, the Line Graph Least Mean Square (LGLMS) algorithm is proposed to conduct adaptive estimation of time-varying edge signals by projecting the edge signals from edge space to node space. LGLMS is an adaptive algorithm analogous to the classical LMS algorithm but applied to graph edges. Unlike edge-specific methods, LGLMS retains all GSP concepts and techniques originally designed for graph nodes, without the need for redefinition on the edges. Experimenting with transportation graphs and meteorological graphs, with the signal observations having noisy and missing values, we confirmed that LGLMS is suitable for the online prediction of time-varying edge signals.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal Multivariate Cluster Evolution Analysis for Detecting and Tracking Climate Impacts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16544v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have seen a growing concern about climate change and its impacts. While Earth System Models (ESMs) can be invaluable tools for studying the impacts of climate change, the complex coupling processes encoded in ESMs and the large amounts of data produced by these models, together with the high internal variability of the Earth system, can obscure important source-to-impact relationships. This paper presents a novel and efficient unsupervised data-driven approach for detecting statistically-significant impacts and tracing spatio-temporal source-impact pathways in the climate through a unique combination of ideas from anomaly detection, clustering and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Using as an exemplar the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, we demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of detecting known post-eruption impacts/events. We additionally describe a methodology for extracting meaningful sequences of post-eruption impacts/events by using NLP to efficiently mine frequent multivariate cluster evolutions, which can be used to confirm or discover the chain of physical processes between a climate source and its impact(s).</p></details> |  |

Similar to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), high-quality benchmark datasets are of great importance to the advances of SNNs. However, our analysis indicates that many prevalent neuromorphic datasets lack strong temporal correlation, preventing SNNs from fully exploiting their spatio-temporal representation capabilities. Meanwhile, the integration of event and frame modalities offers more comprehensive visual spatio-temporal information. Yet, the SNN-based cross-modality fusion remains underexplored. In this work, we present a neuromorphic dataset called DVS-SLR that can better exploit the inherent spatio-temporal properties of SNNs. Compared to existing datasets, it offers advantages in terms of higher temporal correlation, larger scale, and more varied scenarios. In addition, our neuromorphic dataset contains corresponding frame data, which can be used for developing SNN-based fusion methods. By virtue of the dual-modal feature of the dataset, we propose a Cross-Modality Attention (CMA) based fusion method. The CMA model efficiently utilizes the unique advantages of each modality, allowing for SNNs to learn both temporal and spatial attention scores from the spatio-temporal features of event and frame modalities, subsequently allocating these scores across modalities to enhance their synergy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only improves recognition accuracy but also ensures robustness across diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Inevitably, the issue of missing data caused by various disturbances threatens the reliability of data acquisition. Recent studies of diffusion probability models have demonstrated the superiority of deep generative models in imputation tasks by precisely capturing the spatio-temporal correlation of traffic data. One drawback of diffusion models is their slow sampling/denoising process. In this work, we aim to accelerate the imputation process while retaining the performance. We propose a fast conditional diffusion model for spatiotemporal traffic data imputation (FastSTI). To speed up the process yet, obtain better performance, we propose the application of a high-order pseudo-numerical solver. Our method further revs the imputation by introducing a predefined alignment strategy of variance schedule during the sampling process. Evaluating FastSTI on two types of real-world traffic datasets (traffic speed and flow) with different missing data scenarios proves its ability to impute higher-quality samples in only six sampling steps, especially under high missing rates (60\% $\sim$ 90\%). The experimental results illustrate a speed-up of $\textbf{8.3} \times$ faster than the current state-of-the-art model while achieving better performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems for publication.

Existing techniques are often cumbersome, computationally heavy and generally suffer from limitations in wavenumber/frequency response. To address these challenges, we propose Wave (from) Polarized Light Learning (WPLL), a learning based remote sensing method for laboratory implementation, capable of inferring surface elevation and slope maps in high resolution. The method uses the polarization properties of light reflected from the water surface. The WPLL uses a deep neural network (DNN) model that approximates the water surface slopes from the polarized light intensities. Once trained on simple monochromatic wave trains, the WPLL is capable of producing high-resolution and accurate 2D reconstruction of the water surface slopes and elevation in a variety of irregular wave fields. The method's robustness is demonstrated by showcasing its high wavenumber/frequency response, its ability to reconstruct wave fields propagating at arbitrary angles relative to the camera optical axis, and its computational efficiency. This developed methodology is an accurate and cost-effective near-real time remote sensing tool for laboratory water surface waves measurements, setting the path for upscaling to open sea application for research, monitoring, and short-time forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 17 figures, 5 tables, under review in Applied Ocean Research Journal</p></details> |

To make the cooperation safe for the humans involved, the systems have to follow protocols with rigid real-time and real-space properties, but they also need to be capable of making competitive and collaborative decisions with varying rewards and penalties. Due to these tough requirements, the construction of system control software is often very difficult. This calls for applying a model-based engineering approach, which allows one to formally express the time and space properties and use them as guidance for the whole engineering process from requirement definition via system design to software development. Moreover, it is beneficial, if one can verify with acceptable effort, that the time and space requirements are preserved throughout the development steps. This paper focuses on modelling spatio-temporal properties and their model-checking and simulation using different analysis tools in combination with the methods and tool extensions proposed here.

We present a comprehensive investigation of Graph U-Nets, originally developed for classification tasks, now tailored for mesh-agnostic spatio-temporal forecasting of fluid dynamics. Our focus is on enhancing their performance through systematic hyperparameter tuning and architectural modifications. We propose novel approaches to improve mesh-agnostic spatio-temporal prediction of transient flow fields using Graph U-Nets, enabling accurate prediction on diverse mesh configurations. Key enhancements to the Graph U-Net architecture, including the Gaussian-mixture-model convolutional operator and noise injection approaches, provide increased flexibility in modeling node dynamics: the former reduces prediction error by 95\% compared to conventional convolutional operators, while the latter improves long-term prediction robustness, resulting in an error reduction of 86\%. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these enhancements in both transductive and inductive learning settings, showcasing the adaptability of Graph U-Nets to various flow conditions and mesh structures. This work contributes to the field of reduced-order modeling for computational fluid dynamics by establishing Graph U-Nets as a viable and flexible alternative to convolutional neural networks, capable of accurately and efficiently predicting complex fluid flow phenomena across diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This study aims to develop a methodology for analyzing the occupancy rate from large-scale datasets to identify gaps between supply and demand in public transportation.

The results of the model are examined at both the segment and ride levels. Initially, the analysis focuses on identifying segments more likely associated with undercrowding, understanding factors influencing the probability of undercrowding, and exploring their relationships. Subsequently, the analysis extends to the temporal distribution of undercrowding, encompassing its impact on the entire journey.

Although spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved success in modeling various static spatio-temporal forecasting scenarios, real-world spatio-temporal data are typically received in a streaming manner, and the network continuously expands with the installation of new sensors. Thus, spatio-temporal forecasting in streaming scenarios faces dual challenges: the inefficiency of retraining models over newly arrived data and the detrimental effects of catastrophic forgetting over long-term history. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prompt tuning-based continuous forecasting method, following two fundamental tuning principles guided by empirical and theoretical analysis: expand and compress, which effectively resolve the aforementioned problems with lightweight tuning parameters. Specifically, we integrate the base spatio-temporal graph neural network with a continuous prompt pool, utilizing stored prompts (i.e., few learnable parameters) in memory, and jointly optimize them with the base spatio-temporal graph neural network. This method ensures that the model sequentially learns from the spatio-temporal data stream to accomplish tasks for corresponding periods. Extensive experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the multi-faceted superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art baselines, including effectiveness, efficiency, universality, etc.</p></details> |  |

Most modern trajectory planning techniques rely on numerical optimization because high-quality, expressive trajectories that satisfy various constraints can be systematically computed. However, meeting computation time constraints and the potential for numerical instabilities can limit the use of optimization-based planners in safety-critical scenarios. This work presents an optimization-free planning framework that stitches short trajectory segments together with graph search to compute long range, expressive, and near-optimal trajectories in real-time. Our STITCHER algorithm is shown to outperform modern optimization-based planners through our innovative planning architecture and several algorithmic developments that make real-time planning possible. Extensive simulation testing is conducted to analyze the algorithmic components that make up STITCHER, and a thorough comparison with two state-of-the-art optimization planners is performed.

| **[Accurate modeling of continuous-time SAT solvers in SPICE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14690v2)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there has been an increasing interest in employing dynamical systems as solvers of NP-complete problems. In this paper, we present accurate implementations of two continuous-time dynamical solvers, known in the literature as analog SAT and digital memcomputing, using advanced numerical integration algorithms of SPICE circuit simulators. For this purpose, we have developed Python scripts that convert Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems into electronic circuits representing the analog SAT and digital memcomputing dynamical systems. Our Python scripts process conjunctive normal form (CNF) files and create netlists that can be directly imported into LTspice. We explore the SPICE implementations of analog SAT and digital memcomputing solvers by applying these to a selected set of problems and present some interesting and potentially useful findings related to digital memcomputing and analog SAT. In this work, we also introduce networks of continuous-time solvers with potential applications extending beyond the solution of Boolean satisfiability problems.</p></details> |  |

The large bandwidth, array antennas, and non-stationarity caused by high mobility has made 5G-R channel characterization more complex. Therefore, it is essential to develop an accurate channel model for 5G-R. However, researches on channel characterization and time-variant models specific to 5G-R frequency bands and scenarios is scarce. There are virtually no cluster-based time-variant channel models that capture statistical properties of 5G-R channel. In this paper, we propose a cluster-based time-variant channel model for 5G-R within an enhanced 3GPP framework, which incorporates time evolution features. Extensive channel measurements are conducted on 5G-R private network test line in China. We then extract and analyze typical channel fading characteristics and multipath cluster characteristics. Furthermore, birth-death process of the clusters is modeled by using a four-state Markov chain. Finally, a generalized clustered delay line (CDL) model is established in accordance with 3GPP standard and validated by comparing the results of measurements and simulations. This work enhances the understanding of 5G-R channels and presents a flexible cluster-based time-variant channel model. The results can be used in the design, deployment, and optimization of 5G-R networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 13 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications</p></details> |
| **[Graph Mixture of Experts and Memory-augmented Routers for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19108v2)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection is a critical task that involves identifying abnormal patterns or events in data that consist of multiple interrelated time series. In order to better model the complex interdependence between entities and the various inherent characteristics of each entity, the GNN based methods are widely adopted by existing methods. In each layer of GNN, node features aggregate information from their neighboring nodes to update their information. In doing so, from shallow layer to deep layer in GNN, original individual node features continue to be weakened and more structural information,i.e., from short-distance neighborhood to long-distance neighborhood, continues to be enhanced. However, research to date has largely ignored the understanding of how hierarchical graph information is represented and their characteristics that can benefit anomaly detection. Existing methods simply leverage the output from the last layer of GNN for anomaly estimation while neglecting the essential information contained in the intermediate GNN layers. To address such limitations, in this paper, we propose a Graph Mixture of Experts (Graph-MoE) network for multivariate time series anomaly detection, which incorporates the mixture of experts (MoE) module to adaptively represent and integrate hierarchical multi-layer graph information into entity representations. It is worth noting that our Graph-MoE can be integrated into any GNN-based MTS anomaly detection method in a plug-and-play manner. In addition, the memory-augmented routers are proposed in this paper to capture the correlation temporal information in terms of the global historical features of MTS to adaptively weigh the obtained entity representations to achieve successful anomaly estimation. Extensive experiments on five challenging datasets prove the superiority of our approach and each proposed module.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Unlike common data analysis frameworks, it builds up from well defined and reusable logical units (objects), which can be easily combined together in order to ensure a high level of consistency. Thanks to this approach, Timeseria can address by design several non-trivial issues which are often underestimated, such as handling data losses, non-uniform sampling rates, differences between aggregated data and punctual observations, time zones, daylight saving times, and more. Timeseria comes with a comprehensive set of base data structures, data transformations for resampling and aggregation, common data manipulation operations, and extensible models for data reconstruction, forecasting and anomaly detection. It also integrates a fully featured, interactive plotting engine capable of handling even millions of data points.</p></details> |  |

By employing B-spline smoothing, we introduce $\mathcal L_{\infty}$ and $\mathcal L_2$ test statistics statistics based on a smoothed cumulative summation (CUMSUM) process, and derive the corresponding asymptotic distributions under the null and local alternative hypothesis, as well as the phase transition boundary from sparse to dense. We further establish the convergence rate of the proposed break point estimators and conduct statistical inference on the jump magnitude based on the estimated break point, also applicable across sparsely, semi-densely, and densely, observed random functions. Extensive numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed procedures. To illustrate the practical relevance, we apply the developed methods to analyze electricity price data and temperature data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Based Efficient Off-Policy Stabilizing Optimal Control Algorithms for Discrete-Time Linear Systems via Damping Coefficients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20845v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy iteration is one of the classical frameworks of reinforcement learning, which requires a known initial stabilizing control. However, finding the initial stabilizing control depends on the known system model. To relax this requirement and achieve model-free optimal control, in this paper, two different reinforcement learning algorithms based on policy iteration and variable damping coefficients are designed for unknown discrete-time linear systems. First, a stable artificial system is designed, and this system is gradually iterated to the original system by varying the damping coefficients. This allows the initial stabilizing control to be obtained in a finite number of iteration steps. Then, an off-policy iteration algorithm and an off-policy $\mathcal{Q}$-learning algorithm are designed to select the appropriate damping coefficients and realize data-driven. In these two algorithms, the current estimates of optimal control gain are not applied to the system to re-collect data. Moreover, they are characterized by the fast convergence of the traditional policy iteration. Finally, the proposed algorithms are validated by simulation.</p></details> |  |

With the emergence of large models, time series foundation models (TSFMs) have exhibited remarkable generalization capabilities, such as zero-shot learning, through large-scale pre-training. Meanwhile, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have been widely employed to enhance the performance of foundation models on unseen data, allowing models to access to external knowledge. In this paper, we introduce TimeRAF, a Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting model that enhance zero-shot time series forecasting through retrieval-augmented techniques. We develop customized time series knowledge bases that are tailored to the specific forecasting tasks. TimeRAF employs an end-to-end learnable retriever to extract valuable information from the knowledge base. Additionally, we propose Channel Prompting for knowledge integration, which effectively extracts relevant information from the retrieved knowledge along the channel dimension. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, showing significant improvement across various domains and datasets.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods for spatial-temporal control in text-conditioned motion generation suffer from significant runtime inefficiency. To address this issue, we first propose the motion latent consistency model (MotionLCM) for motion generation, building on the motion latent diffusion model. By adopting one-step (or few-step) inference, we further improve the runtime efficiency of the motion latent diffusion model for motion generation. To ensure effective controllability, we incorporate a motion ControlNet within the latent space of MotionLCM and enable explicit control signals (i.e., initial motions) in the vanilla motion space to further provide supervision for the training process. By employing these techniques, our approach can generate human motions with text and control signals in real-time. Experimental results demonstrate the remarkable generation and controlling capabilities of MotionLCM while maintaining real-time runtime efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Motio...</summary><p>MotionLCM project version 1.0 (ECCV 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Frequency-Masked Embedding Inference: A Non-Contrastive Approach for Time Series Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20790v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning underpins most current self-supervised time series representation methods. The strategy for constructing positive and negative sample pairs significantly affects the final representation quality. However, due to the continuous nature of time series semantics, the modeling approach of contrastive learning struggles to accommodate the characteristics of time series data. This results in issues such as difficulties in constructing hard negative samples and the potential introduction of inappropriate biases during positive sample construction. Although some recent works have developed several scientific strategies for constructing positive and negative sample pairs with improved effectiveness, they remain constrained by the contrastive learning framework. To fundamentally overcome the limitations of contrastive learning, this paper introduces Frequency-masked Embedding Inference (FEI), a novel non-contrastive method that completely eliminates the need for positive and negative samples. The proposed FEI constructs 2 inference branches based on a prompting strategy: 1) Using frequency masking as prompts to infer the embedding representation of the target series with missing frequency bands in the embedding space, and 2) Using the target series as prompts to infer its frequency masking embedding. In this way, FEI enables continuous semantic relationship modeling for time series. Experiments on 8 widely used time series datasets for classification and regression tasks, using linear evaluation and end-to-end fine-tuning, show that FEI significantly outperforms existing contrastive-based methods in terms of generalization. This study provides new insights into self-supervised representation learning for time series.

The need to provide a solid foundation for timing correctness and scheduling mechanisms is therefore growing rapidly. Although there are some pioneering studies conducted on formally analyzing the response time of processing chains in ROS 2, the focus has been limited to single-threaded executors, and multi-threaded executors, despite their advantages, have not been studied well. To fill this knowledge gap, in this paper, we propose a comprehensive response-time analysis framework for chains running on ROS 2 multi-threaded executors. We first analyze the timing behavior of the default scheduling scheme in ROS 2 multi-threaded executors, and then present priority-driven scheduling enhancements to address the limitations of the default scheme. Our framework can analyze chains with both arbitrary and constrained deadlines and also the effect of mutually-exclusive callback groups. Evaluation is conducted by a case study on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier and schedulability experiments using randomly-generated chains. The results demonstrate that our analysis framework can safely upper-bound response times under various conditions and the priority-driven scheduling enhancements not only reduce the response time of critical chains but also improve analytical bounds.</p></details> |  |
| **[AverageLinear: Enhance Long-Term Time series forcasting with simple averaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20727v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time series analysis aims to forecast long-term trends by examining changes over past and future periods. The intricacy of time series data poses significant challenges for modeling. Models based on the Transformer architecture, through the application of attention mechanisms to channels and sequences, have demonstrated notable performance advantages. In contrast, methods based on convolutional neural networks or linear models often struggle to effectively handle scenarios with large number of channels. However, our research reveals that the attention mechanism is not the core component responsible for performance enhancement. We have designed an exceedingly simple linear structure AverageLinear. By employing straightforward channel embedding and averaging operations, this model can effectively capture correlations between channels while maintaining a lightweight architecture. Experimentss on real-world datasets shows that AverageLinear matches or even surpasses state-of-the-art Transformer-based structures in performance. This indicates that using purely linear structures can also endow models with robust predictive power.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a novel TTA approach for 3D point cloud classification, combining sampling variation with weight averaging. Our method leverages Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to create multiple point cloud representations, adapting the model for each variation using the TENT algorithm. The final model parameters are obtained by averaging the adapted weights, leading to improved robustness against distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on ModelNet40-C, ShapeNet-C, and ScanObjectNN-C datasets, with different backbones (Point-MAE, PointNet, DGCNN), demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing methods while maintaining minimal resource overhead. The proposed method effectively enhances model generalization and stability in challenging real-world conditions.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by the Helmholtz-Kirchhoff identity in the frequency domain, we propose to relate the time domain measurement data due to random sources to an approximate data set given by the subtraction of two scattered wave fields. We propose a time domain linear sampling method for the approximate data set and show how to tackle the measurement data due to random sources. An imaging functional is built based on the linear sampling method, which reconstructs the support of the unknown scattering object using directly the time domain measurements. The functional framework is based on the Laplace transform, which relates the mapping properties of Laplace domain factorized operators to their counterparts in the time domain. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the capability of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Augmented Mass-Spring model for Real-Time Dense Hair Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17144v2)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel Augmented Mass-Spring (AMS) model for real-time simulation of dense hair at strand level. Our approach considers the traditional edge, bending, and torsional degrees of freedom in mass-spring systems, but incorporates an additional one-way biphasic coupling with a ghost rest-shape configuration. Trough multiple evaluation experiments with varied dynamical settings, we show that AMS improves the stability of the simulation in comparison to mass-spring discretizations, preserves global features, and enables the simulation of non-Hookean effects. Using an heptadiagonal decomposition of the resulting matrix, our approach provides the efficiency advantages of mass-spring systems over more complex constitutive hair models, while enabling a more robust simulation of multiple strand configurations. Finally, our results demonstrate that our framework enables the generation, complex interactivity, and editing of simulation-ready dense hair assets in real-time.

| **[Converting Time Series Data to Numeric Representations Using Alphabetic Mapping and k-mer strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20617v1)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of data analysis and bioinformatics, representing time series data in a manner akin to biological sequences offers a novel approach to leverage sequence analysis techniques. Transforming time series signals into molecular sequence-type representations allows us to enhance pattern recognition by applying sophisticated sequence analysis techniques (e.g. $k$-mers based representation) developed in bioinformatics, uncovering hidden patterns and relationships in complex, non-linear time series data. This paper proposes a method to transform time series signals into biological/molecular sequence-type representations using a unique alphabetic mapping technique. By generating 26 ranges corresponding to the 26 letters of the English alphabet, each value within the time series is mapped to a specific character based on its range. This conversion facilitates the application of sequence analysis algorithms, typically used in bioinformatics, to analyze time series data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by converting real-world time series signals into character sequences and performing sequence classification. The resulting sequences can be utilized for various sequence-based analysis techniques, offering a new perspective on time series data representation and analysis.</p></details> |  |

The network's performance is primarily evaluated on raw speech denoising, with additional assessments on tasks such as super-resolution and de-quantization. We benchmark aTENNuate on the VoiceBank + DEMAND and the Microsoft DNS1 synthetic test sets. The network outperforms previous real-time denoising models in terms of PESQ score, parameter count, MACs, and latency. Even as a raw waveform processing model, the model maintains high fidelity to the clean signal with minimal audible artifacts. In addition, the model remains performant even when the noisy input is compressed down to 4000Hz and 4 bits, suggesting general speech enhancement capabilities in low-resource environments.

The advent of advanced sensing, storage, and networking technologies has resulted in high-dimensional time-series data, however, posing significant challenges for analyzing latent structures over extended temporal scales. Time-series clustering, an established unsupervised learning strategy that groups similar time series together, helps unveil hidden patterns in these complex datasets. In this survey, we trace the evolution of time-series clustering methods from classical approaches to recent advances in neural networks. While previous surveys have focused on specific methodological categories, we bridge the gap between traditional clustering methods and emerging deep learning-based algorithms, presenting a comprehensive, unified taxonomy for this research area. This survey highlights key developments and provides insights to guide future research in time-series clustering.</p></details> |  |

The vast proliferation of time-series data across a wide range of fields has increased the relevance of evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of these distance measures. To provide a comprehensive view of this field, this work considers over 100 state-of-the-art distance measures, classified into 7 categories: lock-step measures, sliding measures, elastic measures, kernel measures, feature-based measures, model-based measures, and embedding measures. Beyond providing comprehensive mathematical frameworks, this work also delves into the distinctions and applications across these categories for both univariate and multivariate cases. By providing comprehensive collections and insights, this study paves the way for the future development of innovative time-series distance measures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-time Fake News from Adversarial Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14651v2)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that existing evaluations for fake news detection based on conventional sources, such as claims on fact-checking websites, result in high accuracies over time for LLM-based detectors -- even after their knowledge cutoffs. This suggests that recent popular fake news from such sources can be easily detected due to pre-training and retrieval corpus contamination or increasingly salient shallow patterns. Instead, we argue that a proper fake news detection dataset should test a model's ability to reason factually about the current world by retrieving and reading related evidence. To this end, we develop a novel pipeline that leverages natural language feedback from a RAG-based detector to iteratively modify real-time news into deceptive fake news that challenges LLMs. Our iterative rewrite decreases the binary classification ROC-AUC by an absolute 17.5 percent for a strong RAG-based GPT-4o detector. Our experiments reveal the important role of RAG in both detecting and generating fake news, as retrieval-free LLM detectors are vulnerable to unseen events and adversarial attacks, while feedback from RAG detection helps discover more deceitful patterns in fake news.</p></details> |  |

This survey groups and summarizes anomaly detection existing solutions under a process-centric taxonomy in the time series context. In addition to giving an original categorization of anomaly detection methods, we also perform a meta-analysis of the literature and outline general trends in time-series anomaly detection research.</p></details> |  |

The PTC-NT-FOZNN, stemming from a novel iteration within the variable-gain ZNN spectrum, known as FOZNNs, features diminishing gains over time and marries noise resistance with predefined-time convergence, making it ideal for energy-efficient robotic motion planning tasks. The PTC-NT-FOZNN enhances traditional ZNN models by incorporating a newly developed activation function that promotes optimal convergence irrespective of the model's order. When evaluated against six established ZNNs, the PTC-NT-FOZNN, with parameters $0 < \alpha \leq 1$, demonstrates enhanced positional precision and resilience to additive noises, making it exceptionally suitable for TVQP tasks. Thorough practical assessments, including simulations and experiments using a Flexiv Rizon robotic arm, confirm the PTC-NT-FOZNN's capabilities in achieving precise tracking and high computational efficiency, thereby proving its effectiveness for robust kinematic control applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures; as accepted for publication</p></details> |

However, such technologies introduce new complexities, raising concerns about their overall impact on traffic networks. This paper focuses on evaluating the effect of navigation apps on traffic flows, particularly examining how real-time route recommendations influence network efficiency and congestion. Using a dynamical network flow model, we study traffic dynamics between an origin-destination pair, where a fraction of drivers follow app recommendations while others rely on fixed route preferences. By incorporating supply-demand mechanisms to account for capacity and volume constraints on routes, we uncover partial demand transfer, i.e., only a portion of the traffic demand is able to traverse the network, while the rest builds up congestion at the origin. We prove that the dynamics converges to a globally stable equilibrium and we provide a detailed analysis of this equilibrium when the choices of the informed drivers follow a logit model, correlating the emergence of partial demand transfer to the penetration rate of navigation apps among users.</p></details> |  |

These adaptive methods have significantly succeeded in various deep learning tasks, outperforming stochastic gradient descent. However, despite AdaGrad's status as a cornerstone of adaptive optimization, its theoretical analysis has not adequately addressed key aspects such as asymptotic convergence and non-asymptotic convergence rates in non-convex optimization scenarios. This study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of AdaGrad and bridge the existing gaps in the literature. We introduce a new stopping time technique from probability theory, which allows us to establish the stability of AdaGrad under mild conditions. We further derive the asymptotically almost sure and mean-square convergence for AdaGrad. In addition, we demonstrate the near-optimal non-asymptotic convergence rate measured by the average-squared gradients in expectation, which is stronger than the existing high-probability results. The techniques developed in this work are potentially of independent interest for future research on other adaptive stochastic algorithms.</p></details> | 51 pages |

| **[Generative Regression Based Watch Time Prediction for Video Recommendation: Model and Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20211v1)** | 2024-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Watch time prediction (WTP) has emerged as a pivotal task in short video recommendation systems, designed to encapsulate user interests. Predicting users' watch times on videos often encounters challenges, including wide value ranges and imbalanced data distributions, which can lead to significant bias when directly regressing watch time. Recent studies have tried to tackle these issues by converting the continuous watch time estimation into an ordinal classification task. While these methods are somewhat effective, they exhibit notable limitations. Inspired by language modeling, we propose a novel Generative Regression (GR) paradigm for WTP based on sequence generation. This approach employs structural discretization to enable the lossless reconstruction of original values while maintaining prediction fidelity. By formulating the prediction problem as a numerical-to-sequence mapping, and with meticulously designed vocabulary and label encodings, each watch time is transformed into a sequence of tokens. To expedite model training, we introduce the curriculum learning with an embedding mixup strategy which can mitigate training-and-inference inconsistency associated with teacher forcing. We evaluate our method against state-of-the-art approaches on four public datasets and one industrial dataset. We also perform online A/B testing on Kuaishou, a leading video app with about 400 million DAUs, to demonstrate the real-world efficacy of our method.

Thus, they require further calibrations. To that end, we first identify three requirements for effective calibration under practical low-tech sensor conditions. Based on the requirements, we develop a model called TESLA, Transformer for effective sensor calibration utilizing logarithmic-binned attention. TESLA uses a high-performance deep learning model, Transformers, to calibrate and capture non-linear components. At its core, it employs logarithmic binning to minimize attention complexity. TESLA achieves consistent real-time calibration, even with longer sequences and finer-grained time series in hardware-constrained systems. Experiments show that TESLA outperforms existing novel deep learning and newly crafted linear models in accuracy, calibration speed, and energy efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Current diagnostic methods primarily rely on identifying prominent features in spirometry (Volume-Flow time series) to detect COPD, but they are not adept at predicting future COPD risk based on subtle data patterns. In this study, we introduce a novel deep learning-based approach, DeepSpiro, aimed at the early prediction of future COPD risk. DeepSpiro consists of four key components: SpiroSmoother for stabilizing the Volume-Flow curve, SpiroEncoder for capturing volume variability-pattern through key patches of varying lengths, SpiroExplainer for integrating heterogeneous data and explaining predictions through volume attention, and SpiroPredictor for predicting the disease risk of undiagnosed high-risk patients based on key patch concavity, with prediction horizons of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years, or even longer. Evaluated on the UK Biobank dataset, DeepSpiro achieved an AUC of 0.8328 for COPD detection and demonstrated strong predictive performance for future COPD risk (p-value < 0.001). In summary, DeepSpiro can effectively predicts the long-term progression of the COPD disease.</p></details> |  |

By incorporating ToA data from 5G base stations, we align the SLAM's local reference frame with a global coordinate system, enabling accurate and consistent global localization. We extend ORB-SLAM3's optimization pipeline to integrate ToA measurements alongside bias estimation, transforming the inherently local estimation into a globally consistent one. This integration effectively resolves scale ambiguity in monocular SLAM systems and enhances robustness, particularly in challenging scenarios where standard SLAM may fail. Our method is evaluated using five real-world indoor datasets collected with RGB-D cameras and inertial measurement units (IMUs), augmented with simulated 5G ToA measurements at 28 GHz and 78 GHz frequencies using MATLAB and QuaDRiGa. We tested four SLAM configurations: RGB-D, RGB-D-Inertial, Monocular, and Monocular-Inertial. The results demonstrate that while local estimation accuracy remains comparable due to the high precision of RGB-D-based ORB-SLAM3 compared to ToA measurements, the inclusion of ToA measurements facilitates robust global positioning. In scenarios where standard mono-inertial ORB-SLAM3 loses tracking, our approach maintains accurate localization throughout the trajectory.</p></details> |  |

Foundation models, pre-trained on vast and varied datasets, can be used in a zero-shot setting with relatively minimal data or further improved through finetuning. We compare the performance of Google's model, called TimesFM, against conventional parametric and non-parametric models, including GARCH, Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS), and empirical quantile estimates, using daily returns from the S\&P 100 index and its constituents over 19 years. Our backtesting results indicate that in terms of the actual-over-expected ratio, the fine-tuned TimesFM model consistently outperforms traditional methods. Regarding the quantile score loss function, it achieves performance comparable to the best econometric approach, the GAS model. Overall, the foundation model is either the best or among the top performers in forecasting VaR across the 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 VaR levels. Fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy, indicating that zero-shot use is not optimal for VaR forecasting.</p></details> |  |

This study focuses on developing and evaluating time series models for forecasting malaria cases across eight Indian states: Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Odisha, Tripura, and Uttar Pradesh. We employed various modeling approaches, including polynomial regression with seasonal components, log-transformed polynomial regression, lagged difference models, and ARIMA models, to capture the temporal dynamics of malaria incidence. Comprehensive model fitting, residual analysis, and performance evaluation using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) indicated that the log-transformed polynomial regression model consistently outperformed other models in terms of accuracy and robustness across all states. Rolling forecast validation further confirmed the superior predictive capability of the log-transformed model over time. Additionally, an interactive R Shiny tool was developed to facilitate the use of these predictive models by researchers and public health officials. This tool allows users to input data, select modeling approaches, and visualize predictions and performance metrics, providing a practical tool for real-time malaria forecasting and decision-making support. Our findings highlight the critical role of appropriate modeling techniques in malaria prediction and offer valuable resources for enhancing malaria surveillance and response efforts.</p></details> | 18 pages |

However, the current questionnaire-based diagnostic methods could bring subjective biases and may be denied by subjects. In search of a more objective means of diagnosis, researchers have begun to experiment with deep learning-based methods for identifying depressive disorders in recent years. Methods: In this study, a novel Spatiotemporal-fused network with Automated multi-scale Depth-wise and TIME-interval-related common feature extractor (SAD-TIME) is proposed. SAD-TIME incorporates an automated nodes' common features extractor (CFE), a spatial sector (SpS), a modified temporal sector (TeS), and a domain adversarial learner (DAL). The CFE includes a multi-scale depth-wise 1D-convolutional neural network and a time-interval embedding generator, where the unique information of each channel is preserved. The SpS fuses the functional connectivity with the distance-based connectivity containing spatial position of EEG electrodes. A multi-head-attention graph convolutional network is also applied in the SpS to fuse the features from different EEG channels. The TeS is based on long short-term memory and graph transformer networks, where the temporal information of different time-windows is fused. Moreover, the DAL is used after the SpS to obtain the domain-invariant feature. Results: Experimental results under tenfold cross-validation show that the proposed SAD-TIME method achieves 92.00% and 94.00% depression classification accuracies on two datasets, respectively, in cross-subject mode. Conclusion: SAD-TIME is a robust depression detection model, where the automatedly-generated features, the SpS and the TeS assist the classification performance with the fusion of the innate spatiotemporal information in the EEG signals.</p></details> | 21pages, 7 figures |

In time-critical systems, it is essential to verify the timing predictability of the system, and the application of scheduling mechanisms in TSN can also bring about changes in system timing. Therefore, schedulability analysis techniques can be used to verify that the system is scheduled according to the scheduling mechanism and meets the timing requirements. In this paper, we provide a clear overview of the state-of-the-art works on the topic of schedulability analysis in TSN in an attempt to clarify the purpose of schedulability analysis, categorize the methods of schedulability analysis and compare their respective strengths and weaknesses, point out the scheduling mechanisms under analyzing and the corresponding traffic classes, clarify the network scenarios constructed during the evaluation and list the challenges and directions still needing to be worked on in schedulability analysis in TSN. To this end, we conducted a systematic literature review and finally identified 123 relevant research papers published in major conferences and journals in the past 15 years. Based on a comprehensive review of the relevant literature, we have identified several key findings and emphasized the future challenges in schedulability analysis for TSN.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Time-Triggered Communication Method Based on Urgency-Based Scheduler in Time-Sensitive Networking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20077v1)** | 2024-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of the automotive industry and automation has led to a growing demand for time-critical systems to have low latency and jitter for critical traffic. To address this issue, the IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group proposed the Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) to implement Time-Triggered (TT) communication, enabling deterministic transmission by assigning specific time windows to each stream. However, the deployment of TAS requires a solution for the particular deployment scenario. Scheduling algorithms with Fixed-Routing and Waiting-Allowed (FR-WA) mechanisms while providing flexible solutions still have room for optimization in terms of their solution time, reducing network design efficiency and online scheduling deployment. Firstly, the paper overviews the key mechanisms to implement TT communication in TSN, including TAS and FR-WA scheduling algorithms. Secondly, building on this overview of these mechanisms, potential problems with the current implementation of the TAS mechanism are analyzed, including the increasing constraint number as the network scales and potential issues that may arise in traffic anomalies. Then, a method for implementing TT communication using Urgency-Based Scheduler (TT-UBS) is proposed to improve solution efficiency and deterministic transmission in the presence of traffic anomalies. The effectiveness of this method is also analyzed. We propose a scheduling algorithm for solving the parameters of the TT-UBS mechanism. Finally, a simulation-based assessment of the TT-UBS mechanism and the scheduling algorithm is presented. In addition, we extend the method of modifying the scheduling algorithm to other scheduling algorithms and explore the solution efficiency of the extended algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Such people face challenges in performing activities of daily living, such as reading, writing, traveling and participating in social gatherings. Many traditional approaches are available to help visually impaired people; however, these are limited in obtaining contextually rich environmental information necessary for independent living. In order to overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a novel wearable vision assistance system that has a hat-mounted camera connected to a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (8GB RAM) with artificial intelligence (AI) technology to deliver real-time feedback to a user through a sound beep mechanism. The key features of this system include a user-friendly procedure for the recognition of new people or objects through a one-click process that allows users to add data on new individuals and objects for later detection, enhancing the accuracy of the recognition over time. The system provides detailed descriptions of objects in the user's environment using a large vision language model (LVLM). In addition, it incorporates a distance sensor that activates a beeping sound using a buzzer as soon as the user is about to collide with an object, helping to ensure safety while navigating their environment. A comprehensive evaluation is carried out to evaluate the proposed AI-based solution against traditional support techniques. Comparative analysis shows that the proposed solution with its innovative combination of hardware and AI (including LVLMs with IoT), is a significant advancement in assistive technology that aims to solve the major issues faced by the community of visually impaired people</p></details> | N-A |

As a classic machine learning task, time series forecasting has recently been boosted by LLMs. Recent works treat large language models as \emph{zero-shot} time series reasoners without further fine-tuning, which achieves remarkable performance. However, there are some unexplored research problems when applying LLMs for time series forecasting under the zero-shot setting. For instance, the LLMs' preferences for the input time series are less understood. In this paper, by comparing LLMs with traditional time series forecasting models, we observe many interesting properties of LLMs in the context of time series forecasting. First, our study shows that LLMs perform well in predicting time series with clear patterns and trends, but face challenges with datasets lacking periodicity. This observation can be explained by the ability of LLMs to recognize the underlying period within datasets, which is supported by our experiments. In addition, the input strategy is investigated, and it is found that incorporating external knowledge and adopting natural language paraphrases substantially improve the predictive performance of LLMs for time series. Overall, our study contributes insight into LLMs' advantages and limitations in time series forecasting under different conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter</p></details> |

While previous methods have made considerable efforts to optimize the adaptation process, a crucial question remains: can the model adapt to continually-changing environments with preserved plasticity over a long time? The plasticity refers to the model's capability to adjust predictions in response to non-stationary environments continually. In this work, we explore plasticity, this essential but often overlooked aspect of continual adaptation to facilitate more sustained adaptation in the long run. First, we observe that most CTTA methods experience a steady and consistent decline in plasticity during the long-timescale continual adaptation phase. Moreover, we find that the loss of plasticity is strongly associated with the change in label flip. Based on this correlation, we propose a simple yet effective policy, Adaptive Shrink-Restore (ASR), towards preserving the model's plasticity. In particular, ASR does the weight re-initialization by the adaptive intervals. The adaptive interval is determined based on the change in label flipping. Our method is validated on extensive CTTA benchmarks, achieving excellent performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Adaptive and View-Invariant Vision Transformer with Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation for Real-Time UAV Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20002v1)** | 2024-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual tracking has made significant strides due to the adoption of transformer-based models. Most state-of-the-art trackers struggle to meet real-time processing demands on mobile platforms with constrained computing resources, particularly for real-time unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking. To achieve a better balance between performance and efficiency, we introduce AVTrack, an adaptive computation framework designed to selectively activate transformer blocks for real-time UAV tracking. The proposed Activation Module (AM) dynamically optimizes the ViT architecture by selectively engaging relevant components, thereby enhancing inference efficiency without significant compromise to tracking performance. Furthermore, to tackle the challenges posed by extreme changes in viewing angles often encountered in UAV tracking, the proposed method enhances ViTs' effectiveness by learning view-invariant representations through mutual information (MI) maximization. Two effective design principles are proposed in the AVTrack. Building on it, we propose an improved tracker, dubbed AVTrack-MD, which introduces the novel MI maximization-based multi-teacher knowledge distillation (MD) framework. It harnesses the benefits of multiple teachers, specifically the off-the-shelf tracking models from the AVTrack, by integrating and refining their outputs, thereby guiding the learning process of the compact student network. Specifically, we maximize the MI between the softened feature representations from the multi-teacher models and the student model, leading to improved generalization and performance of the student model, particularly in noisy conditions. Extensive experiments on multiple UAV tracking benchmarks demonstrate that AVTrack-MD not only achieves performance comparable to the AVTrack baseline but also reduces model complexity, resulting in a significant 17\% increase in average tracking speed.</p></details> |  |

SEIR-like models have been particularly successful in providing accurate short-term predictions. This study fills a notable literature gap by exploring the following question: Is it possible to incorporate a nonparametric susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) COVID-19 model into the inverse-problem regularization framework when the transmission coefficient varies over time? Our positive response considers varying degrees of disease severity, vaccination, and other time-dependent parameters. In addition, we demonstrate the continuity, differentiability, and injectivity of the operator that link the transmission parameter to the observed infection numbers. By employing Tikhonov-type regularization to the corresponding inverse problem, we establish the existence and stability of regularized solutions. Numerical examples using both synthetic and real data illustrate the model's estimation accuracy and its ability to fit the data effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 6 figures (with subfigures)</p></details> |

Within the realm of simulating turbulent flows, large eddy simulation (LES) has emerged as a prevalent alternative to direct numerical simulation (DNS), offering computational efficiency. However, LES cannot accurately capture the full spectrum of turbulent transport scales and is present only at a lower spatial resolution. Reconstructing high-fidelity DNS data from the lower-resolution LES data is essential for numerous applications, but it poses significant challenges to existing super-resolution techniques, primarily due to the complex spatio-temporal nature of turbulent flows. This paper proposes a novel flow reconstruction approach that leverages physical knowledge to model flow dynamics. Different from traditional super-resolution techniques, the proposed approach uses LES data only in the testing phase through a degradation-based refinement approach to enforce physical constraints and mitigate cumulative reconstruction errors over time. Furthermore, a feature sampling strategy is developed to enable flow data reconstruction across different resolutions. The results on two distinct sets of turbulent flow data indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method in reconstructing high-resolution DNS data, preserving the inherent physical attributes of flow transport, and achieving DNS reconstruction at different resolutions.</p></details> | 14 pages |

An initially non-interpretable predictive model to improve the forecast of a classical time-series 'base model' is used. 'Explainability' of the correction is provided by fitting the base model again to the data from which the error prediction is removed (subtracted), yielding a difference in the model parameters which can be interpreted. We provide illustrative examples to demonstrate the potential of the method to discover and explain underlying patterns in the data.</p></details> |  |

Instead of estimating a high-dimensional model at each time and inferring changes later, we directly learn the differential parameter, i.e., the time derivative of the parameter. The main idea is treating the time score function of an exponential family model as a linear model of the differential parameter for direct estimation. We use time score matching to estimate parameter derivatives. We prove the consistency of a regularized score matching objective and demonstrate the finite-sample normality of a debiased estimator in high-dimensional settings. Our methodology effectively infers differential structures in high-dimensional graphical models, verified on simulated and real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Danie...</summary><p>Daniel J.

| **[Direct estimates of irreversibility from time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19772v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The arrow of time can be quantified through the Kullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the distributions of forward and reverse trajectories in a system. Many approaches to estimate this rely on specific models, but the use of incorrect models can introduce uncontrolled errors. Here, we describe a model-free method that uses trajectory data directly to estimate the evidence for irreversibility over finite windows of time. To do this we build on previous work to identify and correct for errors that arise from limited sample size. Importantly, our approach accurately recovers $D_{KL} = 0$ in systems that adhere to detailed balance, and the correct nonzero $D_{KL}$ for data generated by well understood models of nonequilibrium systems. We apply our method to trajectories of neural activity in the retina as it responds to naturalistic inputs, and find evidence of irreversibility in single neurons, emphasizing the non-Markovian character of these data. These results open new avenues for investigating how the brain represents the arrow of time.</p></details> |  |

This paper not only aims to bolster existing algorithms by evaluating two distinct pretrained embeddings suited for ambient sensor activations but also introduces a novel hierarchical architecture. We delve into an architecture anchored on Transformer Decoder-based pre-trained embeddings, reminiscent of the GPT design, and contrast it with the previously established state-of-the-art (SOTA) ELMo embeddings for ambient sensors. Our proposed hierarchical structure leverages the strengths of each pre-trained embedding, enabling the discernment of activity dependencies and sequence order, thereby enhancing classification precision. To further refine recognition, we incorporate into our proposed architecture an hour-of-the-day embedding. Empirical evaluations underscore the preeminence of the Transformer Decoder embedding in classification endeavors. Additionally, our innovative hierarchical design significantly bolsters the efficacy of both pre-trained embeddings, notably in capturing inter-activity nuances. The integration of temporal aspects subtly but distinctively augments classification, especially for time-sensitive activities. In conclusion, our GPT-inspired hierarchical approach, infused with temporal insights, outshines the SOTA ELMo benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Forget: Bayesian Time Series Forecasting using Recurrent Sparse Spectrum Signature Gaussian Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19727v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The signature kernel is a kernel between time series of arbitrary length and comes with strong theoretical guarantees from stochastic analysis. It has found applications in machine learning such as covariance functions for Gaussian processes. A strength of the underlying signature features is that they provide a structured global description of a time series. However, this property can quickly become a curse when local information is essential and forgetting is required; so far this has only been addressed with ad-hoc methods such as slicing the time series into subsegments. To overcome this, we propose a principled, data-driven approach by introducing a novel forgetting mechanism for signatures. This allows the model to dynamically adapt its context length to focus on more recent information. To achieve this, we revisit the recently introduced Random Fourier Signature Features, and develop Random Fourier Decayed Signature Features (RFDSF) with Gaussian processes (GPs). This results in a Bayesian time series forecasting algorithm with variational inference, that offers a scalable probabilistic algorithm that processes and transforms a time series into a joint predictive distribution over time steps in one pass using recurrence. For example, processing a sequence of length $10^4$ steps in $\approx 10^{-2}$ seconds and in $< 1\text{GB}$ of GPU memory. We demonstrate that it outperforms other GP-based alternatives and competes with state-of-the-art probabilistic time series forecasting algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gradient Alignment Improves Test-Time Adaptation for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07343v4)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although recent years have witnessed significant advancements in medical image segmentation, the pervasive issue of domain shift among medical images from diverse centres hinders the effective deployment of pre-trained models. Many Test-time Adaptation (TTA) methods have been proposed to address this issue by fine-tuning pre-trained models with test data during inference. These methods, however, often suffer from less-satisfactory optimization due to suboptimal optimization direction (dictated by the gradient) and fixed step-size (predicated on the learning rate). In this paper, we propose the Gradient alignment-based Test-time adaptation (GraTa) method to improve both the gradient direction and learning rate in the optimization procedure. Unlike conventional TTA methods, which primarily optimize the pseudo gradient derived from a self-supervised objective, our method incorporates an auxiliary gradient with the pseudo one to facilitate gradient alignment. Such gradient alignment enables the model to excavate the similarities between different gradients and correct the gradient direction to approximate the empirical gradient related to the current segmentation task. Additionally, we design a dynamic learning rate based on the cosine similarity between the pseudo and auxiliary gradients, thereby empowering the adaptive fine-tuning of pre-trained models on diverse test data. Extensive experiments establish the effectiveness of the proposed gradient alignment and dynamic learning rate and substantiate the superiority of our GraTa method over other state-of-the-art TTA methods on a benchmark medical image segmentation task.

| **[A Hybrid Technique for Plant Disease Identification and Localisation in Real-time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19682v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past decade, several image-processing methods and algorithms have been proposed for identifying plant diseases based on visual data. DNN (Deep Neural Networks) have recently become popular for this task. Both traditional image processing and DNN-based methods encounter significant performance issues in real-time detection owing to computational limitations and a broad spectrum of plant disease features. This article proposes a novel technique for identifying and localising plant disease based on the Quad-Tree decomposition of an image and feature learning simultaneously. The proposed algorithm significantly improves accuracy and faster convergence in high-resolution images with relatively low computational load. Hence it is ideal for deploying the algorithm in a standalone processor in a remotely operated image acquisition and disease detection system, ideally mounted on drones and robots working on large agricultural fields. The technique proposed in this article is hybrid as it exploits the advantages of traditional image processing methods and DNN-based models at different scales, resulting in faster inference. The F1 score is approximately 0.80 for four disease classes corresponding to potato and tomato crops.</p></details> |  |
| **[Convergence of SGD with momentum in the nonconvex case: A time window-based analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16954v3)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The stochastic gradient descent method with momentum (SGDM) is a common approach for solving large-scale and stochastic optimization problems. Despite its popularity, the convergence behavior of SGDM remains less understood in nonconvex scenarios. This is primarily due to the absence of a sufficient descent property and challenges in simultaneously controlling the momentum and stochastic errors in an almost sure sense. To address these challenges, we investigate the behavior of SGDM over specific time windows, rather than examining the descent of consecutive iterates as in traditional studies. This time window-based approach simplifies the convergence analysis and enables us to establish the iterate convergence result for SGDM under the {\L}ojasiewicz property. We further provide local convergence rates which depend on the underlying {\L}ojasiewicz exponent and the utilized step size schemes.</p></details> | 23 pages |
| **[PLN and NARS Often Yield Similar strength $\times$ confidence Given Highly Uncertain Term Probabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19524v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We provide a comparative analysis of the deduction, induction, and abduction formulas used in Probabilistic Logic Networks (PLN) and the Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS), two uncertain reasoning frameworks aimed at AGI. One difference between the two systems is that, at the level of individual inference rules, PLN directly leverages both term and relationship probabilities, whereas NARS only leverages relationship frequencies and has no simple analogue of term probabilities. Thus we focus here on scenarios where there is high uncertainty about term probabilities, and explore how this uncertainty influences the comparative inferential conclusions of the two systems. We compare the product of strength and confidence ($s\times c$) in PLN against the product of frequency and confidence ($f\times c$) in NARS (quantities we refer to as measuring the "power" of an uncertain statement) in cases of high term probability uncertainty, using heuristic analyses and elementary numerical computations. We find that in many practical situations with high term probability uncertainty, PLN and NARS formulas give very similar results for the power of an inference conclusion, even though they sometimes come to these similar numbers in quite different ways.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-time classification of EEG signals using Machine Learning deployment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19515v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prevailing educational methods predominantly rely on traditional classroom instruction or online delivery, often limiting the teachers' ability to engage effectively with all the students simultaneously. A more intrinsic method of evaluating student attentiveness during lectures can enable the educators to tailor the course materials and their teaching styles in order to better meet the students' needs. The aim of this paper is to enhance teaching quality in real time, thereby fostering a higher student engagement in the classroom activities. By monitoring the students' electroencephalography (EEG) signals and employing machine learning algorithms, this study proposes a comprehensive solution for addressing this challenge. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for simplifying the analysis of complex variables, enabling the effective assessment of the students' concentration levels based on specific parameters. However, the real-time impact of machine learning models necessitates a careful consideration as their deployment is concerned. This study proposes a machine learning-based approach for predicting the level of students' comprehension with regard to a certain topic. A browser interface was introduced that accesses the values of the system's parameters to determine a student's level of concentration on a chosen topic. The deployment of the proposed system made it necessary to address the real-time challenges faced by the students, consider the system's cost, and establish trust in its efficacy. This paper presents the efforts made for approaching this pertinent issue through the implementation of innovative technologies and provides a framework for addressing key considerations for future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Romanian Journal of Information Technology and Automatic Control</p></details> |
| **[RAIN: Real-time Animation of Infinite Video Stream](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19489v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Live animation has gained immense popularity for enhancing online engagement, yet achieving high-quality, real-time, and stable animation with diffusion models remains challenging, especially on consumer-grade GPUs. Existing methods struggle with generating long, consistent video streams efficiently, often being limited by latency issues and degraded visual quality over extended periods. In this paper, we introduce RAIN, a pipeline solution capable of animating infinite video streams in real-time with low latency using a single RTX 4090 GPU. The core idea of RAIN is to efficiently compute frame-token attention across different noise levels and long time-intervals while simultaneously denoising a significantly larger number of frame-tokens than previous stream-based methods. This design allows RAIN to generate video frames with much shorter latency and faster speed, while maintaining long-range attention over extended video streams, resulting in enhanced continuity and consistency. Consequently, a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned with RAIN in just a few epochs can produce video streams in real-time and low latency without much compromise in quality or consistency, up to infinite long. Despite its advanced capabilities, the RAIN only introduces a few additional 1D attention blocks, imposing minimal additional burden. Experiments in benchmark datasets and generating super-long videos demonstrating that RAIN can animate characters in real-time with much better quality, accuracy, and consistency than competitors while costing less latency. All code and models will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Time Series Analysis of Assertions in the Linux Kernel](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19465v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assertions are a classical and typical software development technique. These are extensively used also in operating systems and their kernels, including the Linux kernel. The paper patches a gap in existing knowledge by empirically examining the longitudinal evolution of assertion use in the Linux kernel. According to the results, the use of assertions that cause a kernel panic has slightly but not substantially decreased from the kernel's third to the sixth release series. At the same time, however, the use of softer assertion variants has increased; these do not cause a panic by default but instead produce warnings. With these time series results, the paper contributes to the existing but limited empirical knowledge base about operating system kernels and their long-term evolution.</p></details> | Submitted |

While recent advancements have utilized real-world time-lapse data for training, enabling the estimation of consistent backgrounds and realistic rain streaks, these methods often suffer from computational and memory consumption, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel solution: the Rain Streak Prototype Unit (RsPU). The RsPU efficiently encodes rain streak-relevant features as real-time prototypes derived from time-lapse data, eliminating the need for excessive memory resources. Our de-raining network combines encoder-decoder networks with the RsPU, allowing us to learn and encapsulate diverse rain streak-relevant features as concise prototypes, employing an attention-based approach. To ensure the effectiveness of our approach, we propose a feature prototype loss encompassing cohesion and divergence components. This loss function captures both the compactness and diversity aspects of the prototypical rain streak features within the RsPU. Our method evaluates various de-raining benchmarks, accompanied by comprehensive ablation studies. We show that it can achieve competitive results in various rain images compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by BMVC 2024</p></details> |

Although dimensionality reduction has traditionally focused on the variable space-achieving notable success in minimizing data redundancy and computational complexity-less attention has been paid to reducing the temporal dimension. In this study, we revisit Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a classical dimensionality reduction technique, to explore its utility in temporal dimension reduction for time series data. It is generally thought that applying PCA to the temporal dimension would disrupt temporal dependencies, leading to limited exploration in this area. However, our theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that applying PCA to sliding series windows not only maintains model performance, but also enhances computational efficiency. In auto-regressive forecasting, the temporal structure is partially preserved through windowing, and PCA is applied within these windows to denoise the time series while retaining their statistical information. By preprocessing time-series data with PCA, we reduce the temporal dimensionality before feeding it into TSA models such as Linear, Transformer, CNN, and RNN architectures. This approach accelerates training and inference and reduces resource consumption. Notably, PCA improves Informer training and inference speed by up to 40% and decreases GPU memory usage of TimesNet by 30%, without sacrificing model accuracy. Comparative analysis against other reduction methods further highlights the effectiveness of PCA in improving the efficiency of TSA models.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Its ability to amplify and resonate with the pilot's psyche enables real-time mental control, creating unique applications such as psychomagnetic fields and sensory-based weaponry. This paper presents the development of a novel robotic control system inspired by the Psycho Frame, combining electroencephalography (EEG) and deep learning for real-time control of robotic systems. By capturing and interpreting brainwave data through EEG, the system extends human cognitive commands to robotic actions, reflecting the seamless synchronization of thought and machine, much like the Psyco Frame's integration with a Newtype pilot's mental faculties. This research demonstrates how modern AI techniques can expand the limits of human-machine interaction, potentially transcending traditional input methods and enabling a deeper, more intuitive control of complex robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

To combat the Doppler shift induced by time-varying channels, each device adopts orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation. Our objective is minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) for the target function estimation. Due to the multipath time-varying channels, the OTFS-based AirComp not only suffers from noise but also interference. Specifically, we propose three schemes, namely S1, S2, and S3, for the target function estimation. S1 directly estimates the target function under the impacts of noise and interference. S2 mitigates the interference by introducing a zero padding-assisted OTFS. In S3, we propose an iterative algorithm to estimate the function in a matrix form. In the numerical results, we evaluate the performance of S1, S2, and S3 from the perspectives of MSE and computational complexity, and compare them with benchmarks. Specifically, compared to benchmarks, S3 outperforms them with a significantly lower MSE but incurs a higher computational complexity. In contrast, S2 demonstrates a reduction in both MSE and computational complexity. Lastly, S1 shows superior error performance at small SNR and reduced computational complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 11 figures, accepted by IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications.

| **[Pointwise-in-Time Explanation for Linear Temporal Logic Rules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13956v3)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The new field of Explainable Planning (XAIP) has produced a variety of approaches to explain and describe the behavior of autonomous agents to human observers. Many summarize agent behavior in terms of the constraints, or ''rules,'' which the agent adheres to during its trajectories. In this work, we narrow the focus from summary to specific moments in individual trajectories, offering a ''pointwise-in-time'' view. Our novel framework, which we define on Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) rules, assigns an intuitive status to any rule in order to describe the trajectory progress at individual time steps; here, a rule is classified as active, satisfied, inactive, or violated. Given a trajectory, a user may query for status of specific LTL rules at individual trajectory time steps. In this paper, we present this novel framework, named Rule Status Assessment (RSA), and provide an example of its implementation. We find that pointwise-in-time status assessment is useful as a post-hoc diagnostic, enabling a user to systematically track the agent's behavior with respect to a set of rules.</p></details> | <details><summary>See r...</summary><p>See related publication in Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) 2023</p></details> |

However, their application in anomaly detection and prediction remains underexplored, with growing concerns regarding their black-box nature, lack of interpretability and applicability. This paper critically evaluates the efficacy of TSFM in anomaly detection and prediction tasks. We systematically analyze TSFM across multiple datasets, including those characterized by the absence of discernible patterns, trends and seasonality. Our analysis shows that while TSFMs can be extended for anomaly detection and prediction, traditional statistical and deep learning models often match or outperform TSFM in these tasks. Additionally, TSFMs require high computational resources but fail to capture sequential dependencies effectively or improve performance in few-shot or zero-shot scenarios. \noindent The preprocessed datasets, codes to reproduce the results and supplementary materials are available at https://github.com/smtmnfg/TSFM.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables.

In the proposed scheme, a small portion of video frames is sampled in an unsupervised manner and presented to human annotators, who then label the frames with action categories. Unlike point-level supervision, which requires annotators to search for every action instance in an untrimmed video, frames to annotate are selected without human intervention in AAPL supervision. We also propose a detection model and learning method to effectively utilize the AAPL labels. Extensive experiments on the variety of datasets (THUMOS '14, FineAction, GTEA, BEOID, and ActivityNet 1.3) demonstrate that the proposed approach is competitive with or outperforms prior methods for video-level and point-level supervision in terms of the trade-off between the annotation cost and detection performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI-...</summary><p>AAAI-25.

| **[Weber-Fechner Law in Temporal Difference learning derived from Control as Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21004v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates a novel nonlinear update rule based on temporal difference (TD) errors in reinforcement learning (RL). The update rule in the standard RL states that the TD error is linearly proportional to the degree of updates, treating all rewards equally without no bias. On the other hand, the recent biological studies revealed that there are nonlinearities in the TD error and the degree of updates, biasing policies optimistic or pessimistic. Such biases in learning due to nonlinearities are expected to be useful and intentionally leftover features in biological learning. Therefore, this research explores a theoretical framework that can leverage the nonlinearity between the degree of the update and TD errors. To this end, we focus on a control as inference framework, since it is known as a generalized formulation encompassing various RL and optimal control methods. In particular, we investigate the uncomputable nonlinear term needed to be approximately excluded in the derivation of the standard RL from control as inference. By analyzing it, Weber-Fechner law (WFL) is found, namely, perception (a.k.a. the degree of updates) in response to stimulus change (a.k.a. TD error) is attenuated by increase in the stimulus intensity (a.k.a. the value function). To numerically reveal the utilities of WFL on RL, we then propose a practical implementation using a reward-punishment framework and modifying the definition of optimality. Analysis of this implementation reveals that two utilities can be expected i) to increase rewards to a certain level early, and ii) to sufficiently suppress punishment. We finally investigate and discuss the expected utilities through simulations and robot experiments. As a result, the proposed RL algorithm with WFL shows the expected utilities that accelerate the reward-maximizing startup and continue to suppress punishments during learning.</p></details> | 36 pages 9 figures |
| **[Influence Maximization in Temporal Networks with Persistent and Reactive Behaviors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20936v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Influence maximization in temporal social networks presents unique challenges due to the dynamic interactions that evolve over time. Traditional diffusion models often fall short in capturing the real-world complexities of active-inactive transitions among nodes, obscuring the true behavior of influence spread. In dynamic networks, nodes do not simply transition to an active state once; rather, they can oscillate between active and inactive states, with the potential for reactivation and reinforcement over time. This reactivation allows previously influenced nodes to regain influence potency, enhancing their ability to spread influence to others and amplifying the overall diffusion process. Ignoring these transitions can thus conceal the cumulative impact of influence, making it essential to account for them in any effective diffusion model. To address these challenges, we introduce the Continuous Persistent Susceptible-Infected Model with Reinforcement and Re-activation (cpSI-R), which explicitly incorporates active-inactive transitions, capturing the progressive reinforcement that makes nodes more potent spreaders upon reactivation. This model naturally leads to a submodular and monotone objective function, which supports efficient optimization for seed selection in influence maximization tasks. Alongside cpSI-R, we propose an efficient temporal snapshot sampling method, simplifying the analysis of evolving networks. We then adapt the prior algorithms of seed selection to our model and sampling strategy, resulting in reduced computational costs and enhanced seed selection efficiency. Experimental evaluations on diverse datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in performance over baseline methods, underscoring the effectiveness of cpSI-R for real-world temporal networks</p></details> |  |
| **[UniRS: Unifying Multi-temporal Remote Sensing Tasks through Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20742v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The domain gap between remote sensing imagery and natural images has recently received widespread attention and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated excellent generalization performance in remote sensing multimodal tasks. However, current research is still limited in exploring how remote sensing VLMs handle different types of visual inputs. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{UniRS}, the first vision-language model \textbf{uni}fying multi-temporal \textbf{r}emote \textbf{s}ensing tasks across various types of visual input. UniRS supports single images, dual-time image pairs, and videos as input, enabling comprehensive remote sensing temporal analysis within a unified framework. We adopt a unified visual representation approach, enabling the model to accept various visual inputs. For dual-time image pair tasks, we customize a change extraction module to further enhance the extraction of spatiotemporal features. Additionally, we design a prompt augmentation mechanism tailored to the model's reasoning process, utilizing the prior knowledge of the general-purpose VLM to provide clues for UniRS. To promote multi-task knowledge sharing, the model is jointly fine-tuned on a mixed dataset. Experimental results show that UniRS achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, including visual question answering, change captioning, and video scene classification, highlighting its versatility and effectiveness in unifying these multi-temporal remote sensing tasks. Our code and dataset will be released soon.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Large Language Models-guided Dynamic Adaptation for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14170v3)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning (TKGR) is the process of utilizing temporal information to capture complex relations within a Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) to infer new knowledge. Conventional methods in TKGR typically depend on deep learning algorithms or temporal logical rules. However, deep learning-based TKGRs often lack interpretability, whereas rule-based TKGRs struggle to effectively learn temporal rules that capture temporal patterns. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated extensive knowledge and remarkable proficiency in temporal reasoning. Consequently, the employment of LLMs for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning (TKGR) has sparked increasing interest among researchers. Nonetheless, LLMs are known to function as black boxes, making it challenging to comprehend their reasoning process. Additionally, due to the resource-intensive nature of fine-tuning, promptly updating LLMs to integrate evolving knowledge within TKGs for reasoning is impractical. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Large Language Models-guided Dynamic Adaptation (LLM-DA) method for reasoning on TKGs. Specifically, LLM-DA harnesses the capabilities of LLMs to analyze historical data and extract temporal logical rules. These rules unveil temporal patterns and facilitate interpretable reasoning. To account for the evolving nature of TKGs, a dynamic adaptation strategy is proposed to update the LLM-generated rules with the latest events. This ensures that the extracted rules always incorporate the most recent knowledge and better generalize to the predictions on future events. Experimental results show that without the need of fine-tuning, LLM-DA significantly improves the accuracy of reasoning over several common datasets, providing a robust framework for TKGR tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReTaKe: Reducing Temporal and Knowledge Redundancy for Long Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20504v1)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in video understanding. However, existing VideoLLMs often inherit the limitations of their backbone LLMs in handling long sequences, leading to challenges for long video understanding. Common solutions either simply uniformly sample videos' frames or compress visual tokens, which focus primarily on low-level temporal visual redundancy, overlooking high-level knowledge redundancy. This limits the achievable compression rate with minimal loss. To this end. we introduce a training-free method, $\textbf{ReTaKe}$, containing two novel modules DPSelect and PivotKV, to jointly model and reduce both temporal visual redundancy and knowledge redundancy for long video understanding. Specifically, DPSelect identifies keyframes with local maximum peak distance based on their visual features, which are closely aligned with human video perception. PivotKV employs the obtained keyframes as pivots and conducts KV-Cache compression for the non-pivot tokens with low attention scores, which are derived from the learned prior knowledge of LLMs. Experiments on benchmarks VideoMME, MLVU, and LVBench, show that ReTaKe can support 4x longer video sequences with minimal performance loss (<1%) and outperform all similar-size VideoLLMs with 3%-5%, even surpassing or on par with much larger ones.

However, RL based methods often suffer from low sampling efficiency in the exploration phase, especially for long-horizon manipulation tasks, and generally neglect the semantic information from the task level, resulted in a delayed convergence or even tasks failure. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Temporal-Logic-guided Hybrid policy framework (HyTL) which leverages three-level decision layers to improve the agent's performance. Specifically, the task specifications are encoded via linear temporal logic (LTL) to improve performance and offer interpretability. And a waypoints planning module is designed with the feedback from the LTL-encoded task level as a high-level policy to improve the exploration efficiency. The middle-level policy selects which behavior primitives to execute, and the low-level policy specifies the corresponding parameters to interact with the environment. We evaluate HyTL on four challenging manipulation tasks, which demonstrate its effectiveness and interpretability.

| **[Towards Ideal Temporal Graph Neural Networks: Evaluations and Conclusions after 10,000 GPU Hours](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20256v1)** | 2024-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling dynamic interactions across various domains. The design space of TGNNs is notably complex, given the unique challenges in runtime efficiency and scalability raised by the evolving nature of temporal graphs. We contend that many of the existing works on TGNN modeling inadequately explore the design space, leading to suboptimal designs. Viewing TGNN models through a performance-focused lens often obstructs a deeper understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of each technique. Specifically, benchmarking efforts inherently evaluate models in their original designs and implementations, resulting in unclear accuracy comparisons and misleading runtime. To address these shortcomings, we propose a practical comparative evaluation framework that performs a design space search across well-known TGNN modules based on a unified, optimized code implementation. Using our framework, we make the first efforts towards addressing three critical questions in TGNN design, spending over 10,000 GPU hours: (1) investigating the efficiency of TGNN module designs, (2) analyzing how the effectiveness of these modules correlates with dataset patterns, and (3) exploring the interplay between multiple modules. Key outcomes of this directed investigative approach include demonstrating that the most recent neighbor sampling and attention aggregator outperform uniform neighbor sampling and MLP-Mixer aggregator; Assessing static node memory as an effective node memory alternative, and showing that the choice between static or dynamic node memory should be based on the repetition patterns in the dataset. Our in-depth analysis of the interplay between TGNN modules and dataset patterns should provide a deeper insight into TGNN performance along with potential research directions for designing more general and effective TGNNs.</p></details> |  |

While many species have evolved highly adaptive behavioral responses to such variability, the emerging field of neuromorphic olfaction continues to grapple with the challenge of efficiently sampling and identifying odors in real-time. In this work, we investigate Metal-Oxide (MOx) gas sensor recordings of constant airflow-embedded artificial odor plumes. We discover a data feature that is representative of the presented odor stimulus at a certain concentration - irrespective of temporal variations caused by the plume dynamics. Further, we design a neuromorphic electronic nose front-end circuit for extracting and encoding this feature into analog spikes for gas detection and concentration estimation. The design is inspired by the spiking output of parallel neural pathways in the mammalian olfactory bulb. We test the circuit for gas recognition and concentration estimation in artificial environments, where either single gas pulses or pre-recorded odor plumes were deployed in a constant flow of air. For both environments, our results indicate that the gas concentration is encoded in -- and inversely proportional to the time difference of analog spikes emerging out of two parallel pathways, similar to the spiking output of a mammalian olfactory bulb. The resulting neuromorphic nose could enable data-efficient, real-time robotic plume navigation systems, advancing the capabilities of odor source localization in applications such as environmental monitoring and search-and-rescue.</p></details> |  |
| **[ST$^3$: Accelerating Multimodal Large Language Model by Spatial-Temporal Visual Token Trimming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20105v1)** | 2024-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enhance their perceptual capabilities by integrating visual and textual information. However, processing the massive number of visual tokens incurs a significant computational cost. Existing analysis of the MLLM attention mechanisms remains shallow, leading to coarse-grain token pruning strategies that fail to effectively balance speed and accuracy. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of MLLM attention mechanisms with LLaVA. We find that numerous visual tokens and partial attention computations are redundant during the decoding process. Based on this insight, we propose Spatial-Temporal Visual Token Trimming ($\textbf{ST}^{3}$), a framework designed to accelerate MLLM inference without retraining. $\textbf{ST}^{3}$ consists of two primary components: 1) Progressive Visual Token Pruning (\textbf{PVTP}), which eliminates inattentive visual tokens across layers, and 2) Visual Token Annealing (\textbf{VTA}), which dynamically reduces the number of visual tokens in each layer as the generated tokens grow. Together, these techniques deliver around $\mathbf{2\times}$ faster inference with only about $\mathbf{30\%}$ KV cache memory compared to the original LLaVA, while maintaining consistent performance across various datasets. Crucially, $\textbf{ST}^{3}$ can be seamlessly integrated into existing pre-trained MLLMs, providing a plug-and-play solution for efficient inference.</p></details> | Accepted to AAAI2025 |
| **[STNMamba: Mamba-based Spatial-Temporal Normality Learning for Video Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20084v1)** | 2024-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video anomaly detection (VAD) has been extensively researched due to its potential for intelligent video systems. However, most existing methods based on CNNs and transformers still suffer from substantial computational burdens and have room for improvement in learning spatial-temporal normality. Recently, Mamba has shown great potential for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, providing an effective solution to the above dilemma. To this end, we propose a lightweight and effective Mamba-based network named STNMamba, which incorporates carefully designed Mamba modules to enhance the learning of spatial-temporal normality. Firstly, we develop a dual-encoder architecture, where the spatial encoder equipped with Multi-Scale Vision Space State Blocks (MS-VSSB) extracts multi-scale appearance features, and the temporal encoder employs Channel-Aware Vision Space State Blocks (CA-VSSB) to capture significant motion patterns. Secondly, a Spatial-Temporal Interaction Module (STIM) is introduced to integrate spatial and temporal information across multiple levels, enabling effective modeling of intrinsic spatial-temporal consistency. Within this module, the Spatial-Temporal Fusion Block (STFB) is proposed to fuse the spatial and temporal features into a unified feature space, and the memory bank is utilized to store spatial-temporal prototypes of normal patterns, restricting the model's ability to represent anomalies. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our STNMamba achieves competitive performance with fewer parameters and lower computational costs than existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Continuous Spatial-temporal Dynamics of Turbulent Flow with Test-time Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19927v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The precise simulation of turbulent flows holds immense significance across various scientific and engineering domains, including climate science, freshwater science, and energy-efficient manufacturing. Within the realm of simulating turbulent flows, large eddy simulation (LES) has emerged as a prevalent alternative to direct numerical simulation (DNS), offering computational efficiency. However, LES cannot accurately capture the full spectrum of turbulent transport scales and is present only at a lower spatial resolution. Reconstructing high-fidelity DNS data from the lower-resolution LES data is essential for numerous applications, but it poses significant challenges to existing super-resolution techniques, primarily due to the complex spatio-temporal nature of turbulent flows. This paper proposes a novel flow reconstruction approach that leverages physical knowledge to model flow dynamics. Different from traditional super-resolution techniques, the proposed approach uses LES data only in the testing phase through a degradation-based refinement approach to enforce physical constraints and mitigate cumulative reconstruction errors over time. Furthermore, a feature sampling strategy is developed to enable flow data reconstruction across different resolutions. The results on two distinct sets of turbulent flow data indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method in reconstructing high-resolution DNS data, preserving the inherent physical attributes of flow transport, and achieving DNS reconstruction at different resolutions.</p></details> | 14 pages |

However, the lack of justified graph kernels for spatio-temporal modelling has held back their use in graph problems. We leverage an explicit link between stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) and GPs on graphs, introduce a framework for deriving graph kernels via SPDEs, and derive non-separable spatio-temporal graph kernels that capture interaction across space and time. We formulate the graph kernels for the stochastic heat equation and wave equation. We show that by providing novel tools for spatio-temporal GP modelling on graphs, we outperform pre-existing graph kernels in real-world applications that feature diffusion, oscillation, and other complicated interactions.</p></details> |  |

However, existing whole-body-object interaction video benchmarks overlook the truth that open-world objects are diverse, that is, they usually provide limited and predefined object classes. Therefore, we introduce a new open-world benchmark: Grounding Interacted Objects (GIO) including 1,098 interacted objects class and 290K interacted object boxes annotation. Accordingly, an object grounding task is proposed expecting vision systems to discover interacted objects. Even though today's detectors and grounding methods have succeeded greatly, they perform unsatisfactorily in localizing diverse and rare objects in GIO. This profoundly reveals the limitations of current vision systems and poses a great challenge. Thus, we explore leveraging spatio-temporal cues to address object grounding and propose a 4D question-answering framework (4D-QA) to discover interacted objects from diverse videos. Our method demonstrates significant superiority in extensive experiments compared to current baselines.

We build on an encoder-decoder architecture with parallel decoding and make two key contributions. First, we introduce a bi-directional action context regularizer module on the top of the decoder that ensures temporal context coherence in temporally adjacent segments. Second, we learn from classified segments a transition matrix that models the probability of transitioning from one action to another and the sequence is optimized globally over the full prediction interval. In addition, we use a specialized encoder for the task of action segmentation to increase the quality of the predictions in the observation interval at inference time, leading to a better understanding of the past. We validate our methods on four benchmark datasets for LTA, the EpicKitchen-55, EGTEA+, 50Salads and Breakfast demonstrating superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods, including probabilistic models and also those based on Large Language Models, that assume trimmed video as input. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting PCA for time series reduction in temporal dimension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19423v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Revisiting PCA for Time Series Reduction in Temporal Dimension; Jiaxin Gao, Wenbo Hu, Yuntian Chen; Deep learning has significantly advanced time series analysis (TSA), enabling the extraction of complex patterns for tasks like classification, forecasting, and regression. Although dimensionality reduction has traditionally focused on the variable space-achieving notable success in minimizing data redundancy and computational complexity-less attention has been paid to reducing the temporal dimension. In this study, we revisit Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a classical dimensionality reduction technique, to explore its utility in temporal dimension reduction for time series data. It is generally thought that applying PCA to the temporal dimension would disrupt temporal dependencies, leading to limited exploration in this area. However, our theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that applying PCA to sliding series windows not only maintains model performance, but also enhances computational efficiency. In auto-regressive forecasting, the temporal structure is partially preserved through windowing, and PCA is applied within these windows to denoise the time series while retaining their statistical information. By preprocessing time-series data with PCA, we reduce the temporal dimensionality before feeding it into TSA models such as Linear, Transformer, CNN, and RNN architectures. This approach accelerates training and inference and reduces resource consumption. Notably, PCA improves Informer training and inference speed by up to 40% and decreases GPU memory usage of TimesNet by 30%, without sacrificing model accuracy. Comparative analysis against other reduction methods further highlights the effectiveness of PCA in improving the efficiency of TSA models.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Most modern trajectory planning techniques rely on numerical optimization because high-quality, expressive trajectories that satisfy various constraints can be systematically computed. However, meeting computation time constraints and the potential for numerical instabilities can limit the use of optimization-based planners in safety-critical scenarios. This work presents an optimization-free planning framework that stitches short trajectory segments together with graph search to compute long range, expressive, and near-optimal trajectories in real-time. Our STITCHER algorithm is shown to outperform modern optimization-based planners through our innovative planning architecture and several algorithmic developments that make real-time planning possible. Extensive simulation testing is conducted to analyze the algorithmic components that make up STITCHER, and a thorough comparison with two state-of-the-art optimization planners is performed. It is shown STITCHER can generate trajectories through complex environments over long distances (tens of meters) with low computation times (milliseconds).</p></details> | V1 Draft |

Trajectory prediction spans both short-term and long-term horizons, each requiring distinct considerations: short-term predictions rely on accurately capturing the vehicle's dynamics, while long-term predictions rely on accurately modeling the interaction patterns within the environment. However current approaches, either physics-based or learning-based models, always ignore these distinct considerations, making them struggle to find the optimal prediction for both short-term and long-term horizon. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamics-Enhanced Learning MOdel (DEMO), a novel approach that combines a physics-based Vehicle Dynamics Model with advanced deep learning algorithms. DEMO employs a two-stage architecture, featuring a Dynamics Learning Stage and an Interaction Learning Stage, where the former stage focuses on capturing vehicle motion dynamics and the latter focuses on modeling interaction. By capitalizing on the respective strengths of both methods, DEMO facilitates multi-horizon predictions for future trajectories. Experimental results on the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM), Macau Connected Autonomous Driving (MoCAD), Highway Drone (HighD), and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that DEMO outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines in both short-term and long-term prediction horizons.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Information Fusion</p></details> |

However, EEG source imaging (ESI) based kinematics prediction is sparsely explored in the literature. In this study, pre-movement EEG features are utilized to predict three-dimensional (3D) hand kinematics for the grasp-and-lift motor task. A public dataset, WAY-EEG-GAL, is utilized for MKP analysis. In particular, sensor-domain (EEG data) and source-domain (ESI data) based features from the frontoparietal region are explored for MKP. Deep learning-based models are explored to achieve efficient kinematics decoding. Various time-lagged and window sizes are analyzed for hand kinematics prediction. Subsequently, intra-subject and inter-subject MKP analysis is performed to investigate the subject-specific and subject-independent motor-learning capabilities of the neural decoders. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is used as the performance metric for kinematics trajectory decoding. The rEEGNet neural decoder achieved the best performance with sensor-domain and source-domain features with a time lag and window size of 100 ms and 450 ms, respectively. The highest mean PCC values of 0.790, 0.795, and 0.637 are achieved using sensor-domain features, while 0.769, 0.777, and 0.647 are achieved using source-domain features in x, y, and z-directions, respectively. This study explores the feasibility of trajectory prediction using EEG sensor-domain and source-domain EEG features for the grasp-and-lift task. Furthermore, inter-subject trajectory estimation is performed using the proposed deep learning decoder with EEG source domain features.</p></details> |  |

In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in the synthesis of controllers for systems with complex dynamics and modest online compute budgets. However, the poor sample efficiency of RL and the challenges of reward design make training slow and sometimes unstable, especially for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we leverage the inherent Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional "quotient" MDP to be lifted to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fully-actuated space robot), and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error after the same number of training steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally to this work.

In the case of numerical solution, it is dependent on the original optimal control problem, the choice of a control transcription, and the behavior of a gradient based numerical solver. In this paper we formulate the parameterized global search problem as the task of sampling a conditional probability distribution with support on the neighborhoods of local basins of attraction to the high quality solutions. The conditional distribution is learned and represented using deep generative models that allow for prediction of how the local basins change as parameters vary. The approach is benchmarked on a low thrust spacecraft trajectory optimization problem in the circular restricted three-body problem, showing significant speed-up over a simple multi-start method and vanilla machine learning approaches.

Facing the dual eavesdropping threats, we aim to enhance the average achievable secrecy rate for the communication user by jointly designing the UAV trajectory together with the transmit information and sensing beamforming, while satisfying the requirements on sensing performance and sensing security, as well as the UAV power and flight constraints. To address the non-convex nature of the optimization problem, we employ the alternating optimization (AO) strategy, jointly with the successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) methods.

Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods. Our codes, data, and checkpoints are available at \href{https://qiushisun.github.io/OS-Genesis-Home/}{OS-Genesis Homepage}.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[A data driven approach to classify descriptors based on their efficiency in translating noisy trajectories into physically-relevant information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12570v3)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing the physical complexity of many-body dynamical systems can be challenging. Starting from the trajectories of their constitutive units (raw data), typical approaches require selecting appropriate descriptors to convert them into time-series, which are then analyzed to extract interpretable information. However, identifying the most effective descriptor is often non-trivial. Here, we report a data-driven approach to compare the efficiency of various descriptors in extracting information from noisy trajectories and translating it into physically relevant insights. As a prototypical system with non-trivial internal complexity, we analyze molecular dynamics trajectories of an atomistic system where ice and water coexist in equilibrium near the solid/liquid transition temperature. We compare general and specific descriptors often used in aqueous systems: number of neighbors, molecular velocities, Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP), Local Environments and Neighbors Shuffling (LENS), Orientational Tetrahedral Order, and distance from the fifth neighbor ($d_5$). Using Onion Clustering -- an efficient unsupervised method for single-point time-series analysis -- we assess the maximum extractable information for each descriptor and rank them via a high-dimensional metric. Our results show that advanced descriptors like SOAP and LENS outperform classical ones due to higher signal-to-noise ratios. Nonetheless, even simple descriptors can rival or exceed advanced ones after local signal denoising. For example, $d_5$, initially among the weakest, becomes the most effective at resolving the system's non-local dynamical complexity after denoising. This work highlights the critical role of noise in information extraction from molecular trajectories and offers a data-driven approach to identify optimal descriptors for systems with characteristic internal complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures + 3 in supporting information (at the bottom of the manuscript)</p></details> |
| **[TrajGEOS: Trajectory Graph Enhanced Orientation-based Sequential Network for Mobility Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19092v1)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human mobility studies how people move to access their needed resources and plays a significant role in urban planning and location-based services. As a paramount task of human mobility modeling, next location prediction is challenging because of the diversity of users' historical trajectories that gives rise to complex mobility patterns and various contexts. Deep sequential models have been widely used to predict the next location by leveraging the inherent sequentiality of trajectory data. However, they do not fully leverage the relationship between locations and fail to capture users' multi-level preferences. This work constructs a trajectory graph from users' historical traces and proposes a \textbf{Traj}ectory \textbf{G}raph \textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{O}rientation-based \textbf{S}equential network (TrajGEOS) for next-location prediction tasks. TrajGEOS introduces hierarchical graph convolution to capture location and user embeddings. Such embeddings consider not only the contextual feature of locations but also the relation between them, and serve as additional features in downstream modules. In addition, we design an orientation-based module to learn users' mid-term preferences from sequential modeling modules and their recent trajectories. Extensive experiments on three real-world LBSN datasets corroborate the value of graph and orientation-based modules and demonstrate that TrajGEOS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the next location prediction task.</p></details> |  |

While several CTP methods have been developed for this problem, we posit that none of these methods (1) jointly considers the mutual ternary dependency between three key units (i.e., user, position, and company) of a career and (2) captures the characteristic shifts of key units in career over time, leading to an inaccurate understanding of the job movement patterns in the labor market. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel solution, named as CAPER, that solves the challenges via sophisticated temporal knowledge graph (TKG) modeling. It enables the utilization of a graph-structured knowledge base with rich expressiveness, effectively preserving the changes in job movement patterns. Furthermore, we devise an extrapolated career reasoning task on TKG for a realistic evaluation. The experiments on a real-world career trajectory dataset demonstrate that CAPER consistently and significantly outperforms four baselines, two recent TKG reasoning methods, and five state-of-the-art CTP methods in predicting one's future companies and positions--i.e., on average, yielding 6.80% and 34.58% more accurate predictions, respectively.

| **[Single Trajectory Distillation for Accelerating Image and Video Style Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18945v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based stylization methods typically denoise from a specific partial noise state for image-to-image and video-to-video tasks. This multi-step diffusion process is computationally expensive and hinders real-world application. A promising solution to speed up the process is to obtain few-step consistency models through trajectory distillation. However, current consistency models only force the initial-step alignment between the probability flow ODE (PF-ODE) trajectories of the student and the imperfect teacher models. This training strategy can not ensure the consistency of whole trajectories. To address this issue, we propose single trajectory distillation (STD) starting from a specific partial noise state. We introduce a trajectory bank to store the teacher model's trajectory states, mitigating the time cost during training. Besides, we use an asymmetric adversarial loss to enhance the style and quality of the generated images. Extensive experiments on image and video stylization demonstrate that our method surpasses existing acceleration models in terms of style similarity and aesthetic evaluations. Our code and results will be available on the project page: https://single-trajectory-distillation.github.io.</p></details> |  |

Existing solutions directly train a generative model for observed trajectories and calculate the conditional generative probability $P({T}|{C})$ as the anomaly risk, where ${T}$ and ${C}$ represent the trajectory and SD pair respectively. However, we argue that the observed trajectories are confounded by road network preference which is a common cause of both SD distribution and trajectories. Existing methods ignore this issue limiting their generalization ability on out-of-distribution trajectories. In this paper, we define the debiased trajectory anomaly detection problem and propose a causal implicit generative model, namely CausalTAD, to solve it. CausalTAD adopts do-calculus to eliminate the confounding bias of road network preference and estimates $P({T}|do({C}))$ as the anomaly criterion. Extensive experiments show that CausalTAD can not only achieve superior performance on trained trajectories but also generally improve the performance of out-of-distribution data, with improvements of $2.1\% \sim 5.7\%$ and $10.6\% \sim 32.7\%$ respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2024</p></details> |

In response, this paper introduces a novel framework that utilizes audio array for 3D UAV trajectory estimation. Our approach incorporates a self-supervised learning model, starting with the conversion of audio data into mel-spectrograms, which are analyzed through an encoder to extract crucial temporal and spectral information. Simultaneously, UAV trajectories are estimated using LiDAR point clouds via unsupervised methods. These LiDAR-based estimations act as pseudo labels, enabling the training of an Audio Perception Network without requiring labeled data. In this architecture, the LiDAR-based system operates as the Teacher Network, guiding the Audio Perception Network, which serves as the Student Network. Once trained, the model can independently predict 3D trajectories using only audio signals, with no need for LiDAR data or external ground truth during deployment. To further enhance precision, we apply Gaussian Process modeling for improved spatiotemporal tracking. Our method delivers top-tier performance on the MMAUD dataset, establishing a new benchmark in trajectory estimation using self-supervised learning techniques without reliance on ground truth annotations.</p></details> | Accepted for ICASSP |

To predict the states of the system, the Holt's exponential smoothing techniques and nonlinear dynamic equations of gas pipelines are applied to establish the power and gas system equations, respectively. The square-root cubature Kalman filter algorithm is utilized to address the numerical challenges posed by the strongly nonlinear system equations. The boundary conditions in the gas system include the flow balances at sink nodes, and the mass flow rates of loads have to be predicted at each computation step. For the prediction of load mass flows, the long short-term memory network is employed, known for its effectiveness in time series prediction. Consequently, a combined method based on the square-root cubature Kalman filter and the long short-term memory network is proposed for tracking integrated gas and power systems. To evaluate the tracking performances of the proposed method, the IEEE-39 bus power system and GasLib-40 node gas system are used to form the testing system. Simulation results demonstrate high precision in tracking the dynamic states of power and gas systems. Two indexes are introduced for a numerical analysis of the tracking results, indicating that the accuracy of this method surpasses that of traditional measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics</p></details> |

Although considerable research efforts have been made recently, the inherent trajectory uncertainty caused by various factors including the dynamic driving intends and the diverse driving scenarios still poses significant challenges to accurate trajectory prediction. To address this issue, we propose C2F-TP, a coarse-to-fine denoising framework for uncertainty-aware vehicle trajectory prediction. C2F-TP features an innovative two-stage coarse-to-fine prediction process. Specifically, in the spatial-temporal interaction stage, we propose a spatial-temporal interaction module to capture the inter-vehicle interactions and learn a multimodal trajectory distribution, from which a certain number of noisy trajectories are sampled. Next, in the trajectory refinement stage, we design a conditional denoising model to reduce the uncertainty of the sampled trajectories through a step-wise denoising operation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real datasets NGSIM and highD that are widely adopted in trajectory prediction.

However, in the human task-solving trajectories, we observe significant misalignments between human intentions and the recorded trajectories, which can undermine AI model training. This paper addresses the challenges of these misalignments by proposing a visualization tool and a heuristic algorithm designed to detect and categorize discrepancies in trajectory data. Although the heuristic algorithm requires a set of predefined human intentions to function, which we currently cannot extract, the visualization tool offers valuable insights into the nature of these misalignments. We expect that eliminating these misalignments could significantly improve the utility of trajectory data for AI model training. We also propose that future work should focus on developing methods, such as Topic Modeling, to accurately extract human intentions from trajectory data, thereby enhancing the alignment between user actions and AI learning processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Similarity Trajectories: Linking Sampling Process to Artifacts in Diffusion-Generated Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17109v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artifact detection algorithms are crucial to correcting the output generated by diffusion models. However, because of the variety of artifact forms, existing methods require substantial annotated data for training. This requirement limits their scalability and efficiency, which restricts their wide application. This paper shows that the similarity of denoised images between consecutive time steps during the sampling process is related to the severity of artifacts in images generated by diffusion models. Building on this observation, we introduce the concept of Similarity Trajectory to characterize the sampling process and its correlation with the image artifacts presented. Using an annotated data set of 680 images, which is only 0.1% of the amount of data used in the prior work, we trained a classifier on these trajectories to predict the presence of artifacts in images. By performing 10-fold validation testing on the balanced annotated data set, the classifier can achieve an accuracy of 72.35%, highlighting the connection between the Similarity Trajectory and the occurrence of artifacts. This approach enables differentiation between artifact-exhibiting and natural-looking images using limited training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyperNet Fields: Efficiently Training Hypernetworks without Ground Truth by Learning Weight Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17040v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To efficiently adapt large models or to train generative models of neural representations, Hypernetworks have drawn interest. While hypernetworks work well, training them is cumbersome, and often requires ground truth optimized weights for each sample. However, obtaining each of these weights is a training problem of its own-one needs to train, e.g., adaptation weights or even an entire neural field for hypernetworks to regress to. In this work, we propose a method to train hypernetworks, without the need for any per-sample ground truth. Our key idea is to learn a Hypernetwork `Field` and estimate the entire trajectory of network weight training instead of simply its converged state. In other words, we introduce an additional input to the Hypernetwork, the convergence state, which then makes it act as a neural field that models the entire convergence pathway of a task network. A critical benefit in doing so is that the gradient of the estimated weights at any convergence state must then match the gradients of the original task -- this constraint alone is sufficient to train the Hypernetwork Field. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through the task of personalized image generation and 3D shape reconstruction from images and point clouds, demonstrating competitive results without any per-sample ground truth.</p></details> |  |
| **[Swept Volume-Aware Trajectory Planning and MPC Tracking for Multi-Axle Swerve-Drive AMRs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16875v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-axle autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) are set to revolutionize the future of robotics in logistics. As the backbone of next-generation solutions, these robots face a critical challenge: managing and minimizing the swept volume during turns while maintaining precise control. Traditional systems designed for standard vehicles often struggle with the complex dynamics of multi-axle configurations, leading to inefficiency and increased safety risk in confined spaces. Our innovative framework overcomes these limitations by combining swept volume minimization with Signed Distance Field (SDF) path planning and model predictive control (MPC) for independent wheel steering. This approach not only plans paths with an awareness of the swept volume but actively minimizes it in real-time, allowing each axle to follow a precise trajectory while significantly reducing the space the vehicle occupies. By predicting future states and adjusting the turning radius of each wheel, our method enhances both maneuverability and safety, even in the most constrained environments. Unlike previous works, our solution goes beyond basic path calculation and tracking, offering real-time path optimization with minimal swept volume and efficient individual axle control. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive approach to tackle these challenges, delivering life-saving improvements in control, efficiency, and safety for multi-axle AMRs. Furthermore, we will open-source our work to foster collaboration and enable others to advance safer, more efficient autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Efficient MPPI Trajectory Generation with Unscented Guidance: U-MPPI Control Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12369v3)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The classical Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control framework, while effective in many applications, lacks reliable safety features due to its reliance on a risk-neutral trajectory evaluation technique, which can present challenges for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Furthermore, when the majority of MPPI sampled trajectories concentrate in high-cost regions, it may generate an infeasible control sequence. To address this challenge, we propose the U-MPPI control strategy, a novel methodology that can effectively manage system uncertainties while integrating a more efficient trajectory sampling strategy. The core concept is to leverage the Unscented Transform (UT) to propagate not only the mean but also the covariance of the system dynamics, going beyond the traditional MPPI method. As a result, it introduces a novel and more efficient trajectory sampling strategy, significantly enhancing state-space exploration and ultimately reducing the risk of being trapped in local minima. Furthermore, by leveraging the uncertainty information provided by UT, we incorporate a risk-sensitive cost function that explicitly accounts for risk or uncertainty throughout the trajectory evaluation process, resulting in a more resilient control system capable of handling uncertain conditions. By conducting extensive simulations of 2D aggressive autonomous navigation in both known and unknown cluttered environments, we verify the efficiency and robustness of our proposed U-MPPI control strategy compared to the baseline MPPI. We further validate the practicality of U-MPPI through real-world demonstrations in unknown cluttered environments, showcasing its superior ability to incorporate both the UT and local costmap into the optimization problem without introducing additional complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper comprises 20 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables, 1 algorithm, and 1 appendix.

| **[Surrogate Modeling of Trajectory Map-matching in Urban Road Networks using Transformer Sequence-to-Sequence Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12460v3)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale geolocation telematics data acquired from connected vehicles has the potential to significantly enhance mobility infrastructures and operational systems within smart cities. To effectively utilize this data, it is essential to accurately match the geolocation data to the road segments. However, this matching is often not trivial due to the low sampling rate and errors exacerbated by multipath effects in urban environments. Traditionally, statistical modeling techniques such as Hidden-Markov models incorporating domain knowledge into the matching process have been extensively used for map-matching tasks. However, rule-based map-matching tasks are noise-sensitive and inefficient in processing large-scale trajectory data. Deep learning techniques directly learn the relationship between observed data and road networks from the data, often without the need for hand-crafted rules or domain knowledge. This renders them an efficient approach for map-matching large-scale datasets and more robust to the noise. This paper introduces a deep-learning model, specifically the transformer-based encoder-decoder model, to perform as a surrogate for offline map-matching algorithms. The encoder-decoder architecture initially encodes the series of noisy GPS points into a representation that automatically captures hidden contextual structures and spatial correlations between GPS points. Subsequently, the decoder associates data points with the road network features and thus transforms these representations into a sequence of road segments. The model is trained and evaluated using GPS traces collected in Manhattan, New York. Achieving an accuracy of 75%, transformer-based encoder-decoder models extensively employed in natural language processing presented a promising performance for translating noisy GPS data to the navigated routes in urban road networks.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

Our simulator efficiently models vehicle motion, generating trajectories that can be supervised to fit real-world data. By leveraging its differentiable nature, IDM parameters are optimized using gradient-based methods. With the capability to simulate up to 2 million vehicles in real time, the system is scalable for large-scale trajectory optimization. We show that we can use the simulator to filter noise in the input trajectories (trajectory filtering), reconstruct dense trajectories from sparse ones (trajectory reconstruction), and predict future trajectories (trajectory prediction), with all generated trajectories adhering to physical laws. We validate our simulator and algorithm on several datasets including NGSIM and Waymo Open Dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Choice Between Partial Trajectories: Disentangling Goals from Beliefs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22690v3)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI agents generate increasingly sophisticated behaviors, manually encoding human preferences to guide these agents becomes more challenging. To address this, it has been suggested that agents instead learn preferences from human choice data. This approach requires a model of choice behavior that the agent can use to interpret the data. For choices between partial trajectories of states and actions, previous models assume choice probabilities are determined by the partial return or the cumulative advantage. We consider an alternative model based instead on the bootstrapped return, which adds to the partial return an estimate of the future return. Benefits of the bootstrapped return model stem from its treatment of human beliefs. Unlike partial return, choices based on bootstrapped return reflect human beliefs about the environment. Further, while recovering the reward function from choices based on cumulative advantage requires that those beliefs are correct, doing so from choices based on bootstrapped return does not. To motivate the bootstrapped return model, we formulate axioms and prove an Alignment Theorem. This result formalizes how, for a general class of preferences, such models are able to disentangle goals from beliefs. This ensures recovery of an aligned reward function when learning from choices based on bootstrapped return. The bootstrapped return model also affords greater robustness to choice behavior. Even when choices are based on partial return, learning via a bootstrapped return model recovers an aligned reward function. The same holds with choices based on the cumulative advantage if the human and the agent both adhere to correct and consistent beliefs about the environment. On the other hand, if choices are based on bootstrapped return, learning via partial return or cumulative advantage models does not generally produce an aligned reward function.</p></details> |  |
| **[Effective and Efficient Representation Learning for Flight Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16581v1)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flight trajectory data plays a vital role in the traffic management community, especially for downstream tasks such as trajectory prediction, flight recognition, and anomaly detection. Existing works often utilize handcrafted features and design models for different tasks individually, which heavily rely on domain expertise and are hard to extend. We argue that different flight analysis tasks share the same useful features of the trajectory. Jointly learning a unified representation for flight trajectories could be beneficial for improving the performance of various tasks. However, flight trajectory representation learning (TRL) faces two primary challenges, \ie unbalanced behavior density and 3D spatial continuity, which disable recent general TRL methods. In this paper, we propose Flight2Vec , a flight-specific representation learning method to address these challenges. Specifically, a behavior-adaptive patching mechanism is used to inspire the learned representation to pay more attention to behavior-dense segments. Moreover, we introduce a motion trend learning technique that guides the model to memorize not only the precise locations, but also the motion trend to generate better representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Flight2Vec significantly improves performance in downstream tasks such as flight trajectory prediction, flight recognition, and anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Recurrent Aligned Network for Generalized Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05810v2)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is a crucial component in computer vision and robotics, but remains challenging due to the domain shift problem. Previous studies have tried to tackle this problem by leveraging a portion of the trajectory data from the target domain to adapt the model. However, such domain adaptation methods are impractical in real-world scenarios, as it is infeasible to collect trajectory data from all potential target domains. In this paper, we study a task named generalized pedestrian trajectory prediction, with the aim of generalizing the model to unseen domains without accessing their trajectories. To tackle this task, we introduce a Recurrent Aligned Network~(RAN) to minimize the domain gap through domain alignment. Specifically, we devise a recurrent alignment module to effectively align the trajectory feature spaces at both time-state and time-sequence levels by the recurrent alignment strategy.Furthermore, we introduce a pre-aligned representation module to combine social interactions with the recurrent alignment strategy, which aims to consider social interactions during the alignment process instead of just target trajectories. We extensively evaluate our method and compare it with state-of-the-art methods on three widely used benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate the superior generalization capability of our method. Our work not only fills the gap in the generalization setting for practical pedestrian trajectory prediction but also sets strong baselines in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Dataset Trajectory Return Regularization for Offline Preference-based Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09104v2)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) typically operates in two phases: first, use human preferences to learn a reward model and annotate rewards for a reward-free offline dataset; second, learn a policy by optimizing the learned reward via offline RL. However, accurately modeling step-wise rewards from trajectory-level preference feedback presents inherent challenges. The reward bias introduced, particularly the overestimation of predicted rewards, leads to optimistic trajectory stitching, which undermines the pessimism mechanism critical to the offline RL phase. To address this challenge, we propose In-Dataset Trajectory Return Regularization (DTR) for offline PbRL, which leverages conditional sequence modeling to mitigate the risk of learning inaccurate trajectory stitching under reward bias. Specifically, DTR employs Decision Transformer and TD-Learning to strike a balance between maintaining fidelity to the behavior policy with high in-dataset trajectory returns and selecting optimal actions based on high reward labels. Additionally, we introduce an ensemble normalization technique that effectively integrates multiple reward models, balancing the tradeoff between reward differentiation and accuracy. Empirical evaluations on various benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DTR over other state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, Proceedings of the 39th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-25)</p></details> |

If a planned trajectory violates traffic rules, it is common to replan a new trajectory from scratch. We instead propose a trajectory repair technique to save computation time.

Experiments in high-fidelity simulators and in the real world demonstrate the benefits of our proposed approach in various scenarios. Even in complex environments with intricate rules, we efficiently and reliably repair rule-violating trajectories, enabling automated vehicles to swiftly resume legally safe operation in real-time.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 IEEE.

In complex scenarios like sports, agents' trajectories are influenced by group interactions and intentions, including team strategies and opponent actions. To this end, we propose a novel diffusion-based trajectory prediction framework that integrates group-level interactions into a conditional diffusion model, enabling the generation of diverse trajectories aligned with specific group activity. To capture dynamic semantic intentions, we frame group interaction prediction as a cooperative game, using Banzhaf interaction to model cooperation trends. We then fuse semantic intentions with enhanced agent embeddings, which are refined through both global and local aggregation. Furthermore, we expand the NBA SportVU dataset by adding human annotations of team-level tactics for trajectory and tactic prediction tasks. Extensive experiments on three widely-adopted datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Trajectory Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15429v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning safe behaviors without engaging in risky online interactions with the environment. Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |

Still, existing methods that perform dragging in the 2D space usually face ambiguity when handling out-of-plane movements. In this work, we augment the interaction with a new dimension, i.e., the depth dimension, such that users are allowed to assign a relative depth for each point on the trajectory. That way, our new interaction paradigm not only inherits the convenience from 2D dragging, but facilitates trajectory control in the 3D space, broadening the scope of creativity. We propose a pioneering method for 3D trajectory control in image-to-video synthesis by abstracting object masks into a few cluster points. These points, accompanied by the depth information and the instance information, are finally fed into a video diffusion model as the control signal. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, dubbed LeviTor, in precisely manipulating the object movements when producing photo-realistic videos from static images.

| **[STRAP: Robot Sub-Trajectory Retrieval for Augmented Policy Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15182v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot learning is witnessing a significant increase in the size, diversity, and complexity of pre-collected datasets, mirroring trends in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. Many robot learning methods treat such datasets as multi-task expert data and learn a multi-task, generalist policy by training broadly across them. Notably, while these generalist policies can improve the average performance across many tasks, the performance of generalist policies on any one task is often suboptimal due to negative transfer between partitions of the data, compared to task-specific specialist policies. In this work, we argue for the paradigm of training policies during deployment given the scenarios they encounter: rather than deploying pre-trained policies to unseen problems in a zero-shot manner, we non-parametrically retrieve and train models directly on relevant data at test time. Furthermore, we show that many robotics tasks share considerable amounts of low-level behaviors and that retrieval at the "sub"-trajectory granularity enables significantly improved data utilization, generalization, and robustness in adapting policies to novel problems. In contrast, existing full-trajectory retrieval methods tend to underutilize the data and miss out on shared cross-task content. This work proposes STRAP, a technique for leveraging pre-trained vision foundation models and dynamic time warping to retrieve sub-sequences of trajectories from large training corpora in a robust fashion. STRAP outperforms both prior retrieval algorithms and multi-task learning methods in simulated and real experiments, showing the ability to scale to much larger offline datasets in the real world as well as the ability to learn robust control policies with just a handful of real-world demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website at https://weirdlabuw.github.io/strap/</p></details> |

Diffusion is an iterative algorithm in which samples are generated step-by-step, starting from pure noise. This process introduces the notion of diffusion trajectories, i.e., paths from the standard Gaussian distribution to the target image distribution. In this context, we study discriminative algorithms operating on these trajectories. Specifically, given a pre-trained diffusion model, we consider the problem of classifying images as part of the training dataset, generated by the model or originating from an external source. Our approach demonstrates the presence of patterns across steps that can be leveraged for classification. We also conduct ablation studies, which reveal that using higher-order gradient features to characterize the trajectories leads to significant performance gains and more robust algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction with Difficulty-Guided Feature Enhancement Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18551v3)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving as it aims to forecast the future movements of traffic participants. Traditional methods usually perform holistic inference on the trajectories of agents, neglecting the differences in prediction difficulty among agents. This paper proposes a novel Difficulty-Guided Feature Enhancement Network (DGFNet), which leverages the prediction difficulty differences among agents for multi-agent trajectory prediction. Firstly, we employ spatio-temporal feature encoding and interaction to capture rich spatio-temporal features. Secondly, a difficulty-guided decoder controls the flow of future trajectories into subsequent modules, obtaining reliable future trajectories. Then, feature interaction and fusion are performed through the future feature interaction module. Finally, the fused agent features are fed into the final predictor to generate the predicted trajectory distributions for multiple participants. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Argoverse 1\&2 motion forecasting benchmarks. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each module. Moreover, compared with SOTA methods, our method balances trajectory prediction accuracy and real-time inference speed.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a model predictive control (MPC) approach integrated with a hysteresis inverse based on the Hammerstein modeling structure of the PFSM. The MPC is designed to decouple the rate-dependent dual-axis linear components, with an augmented error integral variable introduced in the state space to eliminate steady-state errors. Moreover, proofs of zero steady-state error and disturbance rejection are provided. The hysteresis inverse model is then cascaded to compensate for the rate-independent nonlinear components. Finally, PFSM tracking experiments are conducted on step, sinusoidal, triangular, and composite trajectories. Compared to traditional model-free and existing model-based controllers, the proposed method significantly enhances tracking accuracy, demonstrating superior tracking performance and robustness to frequency variations. These results offer valuable insights for engineering applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[EPN: An Ego Vehicle Planning-Informed Network for Target Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14442v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction plays a crucial role in improving the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles, serving as an intermediate link between perception and planning. However, due to the highly dynamic and multimodal nature of the task, accurately predicting the future trajectory of a target vehicle remains a significant challenge. To address these challenges, we propose an Ego vehicle Planning-informed Network (EPN) for multimodal trajectory prediction. Current trajectory prediction methods typically use the historical trajectory and vehicle attributes as inputs, focusing primarily on how historical information influences the future trajectory of the target vehicle. In real-world driving scenarios, however, the future trajectory of a vehicle is influenced not only by its own historical data but also by the behavior of other vehicles on the road. To address this, we incorporate the future planned trajectory of the ego vehicle as an additional input to simulate the mutual influence between the ego vehicle's planned trajectory and the predicted trajectory of the target vehicle. Furthermore, to tackle the challenges of intention ambiguity and large prediction errors often encountered in methods based on driving intentions, we propose a target's endpoint prediction module. This module first predicts the possible endpoints of the target vehicle, then refines these predictions through a correction mechanism, and finally generates a complete multimodal predicted trajectory based on the corrected endpoints. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to other trajectory prediction methods, EPN achieves an average reduction of 34.9%, 30.7%, and 30.4% in RMSE, ADE, and FDE evaluation metrics on the NGSIM dataset, and an average reduction of 64.6%, 64.5%, and 64.3% in RMSE, ADE, and FDE on the HighD dataset. These results highlight the strong performance of EPN in trajectory prediction.</p></details> |  |

This work explores the integration of Transformer based model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based technique to enhance spatial and temporal feature learning in vehicle trajectory prediction. Here, a hybrid model that combines LSTMs for temporal encoding with a Transformer encoder for capturing complex interactions between vehicles is proposed. Spatial trajectory features of the neighboring vehicles are processed and goes through a masked scatter mechanism in a grid based environment, which is then combined with temporal trajectory of the vehicles. This combined trajectory data are learned by sequential LSTM encoding and Transformer based attention layers. The proposed model is benchmarked against predecessor LSTM based methods, including STA-LSTM, SA-LSTM, CS-LSTM, and NaiveLSTM. Our results, while not outperforming it's predecessor, demonstrate the potential of integrating Transformers with LSTM based technique to build interpretable trajectory prediction model. Future work will explore alternative architectures using Transformer applications to further enhance performance.

| **[Multi-UAV Collaborative Trajectory Planning for Seamless Data Collection and Transmission](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12494v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted plenty of attention due to their high flexibility and enhanced communication ability. However, the limited coverage and energy of UAVs make it difficult to provide timely wireless service for large-scale sensor networks, which also exist in multiple UAVs. To this end, the advanced collaboration mechanism of UAVs urgently needs to be designed. In this paper, we propose a multi-UAV collaborative scheme for seamless data collection and transmission, where UAVs are dispatched to collection points (CPs) to collect and transmit the time-critical data to the ground base station (BS) simultaneously through the cooperative backhaul link. Specifically, the mission completion time is minimized by optimizing the trajectories, task allocation, collection time scheduling, and transmission topology of UAVs while ensuring backhaul link to the BS. However, the formulated problem is non-convex and challenging to solve directly. To tackle this problem, the CP locations and transmission topology of UAVs are obtained by sensor node (SN) clustering and region division. Next, the transmission connectivity condition between UAVs is derived to facilitate the trajectory discretization and thus reduce the dimensions of variables. This simplifies the problem to optimizing the UAV hovering locations, hovering time, and CP serving sequence. Then, we propose a point-matching-based trajectory planning algorithm to solve the problem efficiently. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves significant performance gains over the two benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, submitted to WCNC Workshop 2025</p></details> |

To build accurate maps, data from mobile 3D LiDAR sensors is often used. Mapping requires correctly aligning the individual point clouds to each other to obtain a globally consistent map. In this paper, we investigate the problem of multi-scan alignment to obtain globally consistent point cloud maps. We propose a 3D LiDAR bundle adjustment approach to solve the global alignment problem and jointly optimize the available data. Utilizing a continuous-time trajectory allows us to consider the ego-motion of the LiDAR scanner while recording a single scan directly in the least squares adjustment. Furthermore, pruning the search space of correspondences and utilizing out-of-core circular buffer enables our approach to align thousands of point clouds efficiently. We successfully align point clouds recorded with a handheld LiDAR, as well as ones mounted on a vehicle, and are able to perform multi-session alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Traditional models often struggle with real-time processing, capturing non-linearity and uncertainty in traffic environments, efficiency in dense traffic, and modeling temporal dynamics of interactions. We introduce NEST (Neuromodulated Small-world Hypergraph Trajectory Prediction), a novel framework that integrates Small-world Networks and hypergraphs for superior interaction modeling and prediction accuracy. This integration enables the capture of both local and extended vehicle interactions, while the Neuromodulator component adapts dynamically to changing traffic conditions. We validate the NEST model on several real-world datasets, including nuScenes, MoCAD, and HighD. The results consistently demonstrate that NEST outperforms existing methods in various traffic scenarios, showcasing its exceptional generalization capability, efficiency, and temporal foresight. Our comprehensive evaluation illustrates that NEST significantly improves the reliability and operational efficiency of autonomous driving systems, making it a robust solution for trajectory prediction in complex traffic environments.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI-25 |

This means that both the filtering and predicted densities for the set of targets are PMBM. In this paper, we first show that the PMBM density is also conjugate for sets of trajectories with the standard point target measurement model. Second, based on this theoretical foundation, we develop two trajectory PMBM filters that provide recursions to calculate the posterior density for the set of all trajectories that have ever been present in the surveillance area, and the posterior density of the set of trajectories present at the current time step in the surveillance area. These two filters therefore provide complete probabilistic information on the considered trajectories enabling optimal trajectory estimation. Third, we establish that the density of the set of trajectories in any time window, given the measurements in a possibly different time window, is also a PMBM. Finally, the trajectory PMBM filters are evaluated via simulations, and are shown to yield state-of-the-art performance compared to other multi-target tracking algorithms based on random finite sets and multiple hypothesis tracking.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted in IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems.

A battery energy storage system (BESS) is commonly used to manage these demand charges. Economic model predictive control (EMPC) with a reference trajectory can be used to dispatch the BESS to optimize the microgrid operating cost. Since demand charges are incurred monthly, EMPC requires a full-month reference trajectory for asymptotic stability guarantees that result in optimal operating costs. However, a full-month reference trajectory is unrealistic from a renewable generation forecast perspective. Therefore, to construct a practical EMPC with a reference trajectory, an EMPC formulation considering both non-coincident demand and on-peak demand charges is designed in this work for 24 to 48 h prediction horizons. The corresponding reference trajectory is computed at each EMPC step by solving an optimal control problem over 24 to 48 h reference (trajectory) horizon. Furthermore, BESS state of charge regulation constraints are incorporated to guarantee the BESS energy level in the long term. Multiple reference and prediction horizon lengths are compared for both shrinking and rolling horizons with real-world data. The proposed EMPC with 48 h rolling reference and prediction horizons outperforms the traditional EMPC benchmark with a 2% reduction in the annual cost, proving its economic benefits.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid</p></details> |

Our framework begins by generating panoptic occupancy local semantic maps and accurate localization information from data aligned between a monocular camera, IMU, and GPS. This information is combined with input terrain point clouds or preloaded terrain information to initialize the planning process. We propose the Radiant Field-Informed Coverage Planning algorithm, which utilizes a diffusion field model to dynamically adjust the robot's coverage trajectory and speed based on environmental attributes such as dirtiness and dryness. By modeling the spatial influence of the robot's actions using a Gaussian field, ensures a speed-optimized, uniform coverage trajectory while adapting to varying environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a Toy-GS method for accurately rendering large-scale free camera trajectories. Specifically, we propose an adaptive spatial division approach for free trajectories to divide cameras and the sparse point cloud of the entire scene into various regions according to camera poses. Training each local Gaussian in parallel for each area enables us to concentrate on texture details and minimize GPU memory usage. Next, we use the multi-view constraint and position-aware point adaptive control (PPAC) to improve the rendering quality of texture details. In addition, our regional fusion approach combines local and global Gaussians to enhance rendering quality with an increasing number of divided areas. Extensive experiments have been carried out to confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of Toy-GS, leading to state-of-the-art results on two public large-scale datasets as well as our SCUTic dataset. Our proposal demonstrates an enhancement of 1.19 dB in PSNR and conserves 7 G of GPU memory when compared to various benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, the development of such agents is hindered by the lack of high-quality, multi-step trajectory data required for effective training. Existing approaches rely on expensive and labor-intensive human annotation, making them unsustainable at scale. To address this challenge, we propose AgentTrek, a scalable data synthesis pipeline that generates high-quality GUI agent trajectories by leveraging web tutorials. Our method automatically gathers tutorial-like texts from the internet, transforms them into task goals with step-by-step instructions, and employs a visual-language model agent to simulate their execution in a real digital environment. A VLM-based evaluator ensures the correctness of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with these synthesized trajectories significantly improves their grounding and planning performance over the current models. Moreover, our approach is more cost-efficient compared to traditional human annotation methods. This work underscores the potential of guided replay with web tutorials as a viable strategy for large-scale GUI agent training, paving the way for more capable and autonomous digital agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://agenttrek.github.io</p></details> |

This study addresses this gap by introducing an online nonlinear programming trajectory optimization framework that integrates a differentiable energy model into autonomous systems. By leveraging traffic and slope profile predictions within a safety-critical framework, the proposed method enhances fuel efficiency for both sedans and diesel trucks by 3.71\% and 7.15\%, respectively, when compared to traditional model-agnostic quadratic programming techniques. These improvements translate to a potential \$6.14 billion economic benefit for the U.S. trucking industry. This work bridges the gap between model-agnostic autonomous driving and model-aware ECO-driving, highlighting a practical pathway for integrating energy efficiency into real-time trajectory planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robot Agnostic Visual Servoing considering kinematic constraints enabled by a decoupled network trajectory planner structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07017v3)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a visual servoing method consisting of a detection network and a velocity trajectory planner. First, the detection network estimates the objects position and orientation in the image space. Furthermore, these are normalized and filtered. The direction and orientation is then the input to the trajectory planner, which considers the kinematic constrains of the used robotic system. This allows safe and stable control, since the kinematic boundary values are taken into account in planning. Also, by having direction estimation and velocity planner separated, the learning part of the method does not directly influence the control value. This also enables the transfer of the method to different robotic systems without retraining, therefore being robot agnostic. We evaluate our method on different visual servoing tasks with and without clutter on two different robotic systems. Our method achieved mean absolute position errors of <0.5 mm and orientation errors of <1{\deg}. Additionally, we transferred the method to a new system which differs in robot and camera, emphasizing robot agnostic capability of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>\copy...</summary><p>\copyright 2024 IEEE.

This paper delves into the development of an innovative Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) framework, specifically tailored for beamforming and trajectory prediction processes. Central to this research is the exploration of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-enabled communication system, which seamlessly integrates ISAC technology. This integration underscores the synergistic interplay between sensing and communication capabilities. The proposed system initially deploys omnidirectional beams for the sensing-focused phase, subsequently transitioning to directional beams for precise object tracking. This process incorporates an Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF) methodology for the accurate estimation and prediction of object states. A novel frame structure is introduced, employing historical sensing data to optimize beamforming in real-time for subsequent time slots, a strategy we refer to as 'temporal-assisted' beamforming. To refine the temporal-assisted beamforming technique, we employ Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) in tandem with Iterative Rank Minimization (IRM), yielding high-quality suboptimal solutions. Comparative analysis with conventional pilot-based systems reveals that our approach yields a substantial improvement of 156\% in multi-object scenarios and 136\% in single-object scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Giving constraints in natural language form has great potential for practical scenarios due to its flexible transfer capability and accessibility. Previous safe RL methods with natural language constraints typically need to design cost functions manually for each constraint, which requires domain expertise and lacks flexibility. In this paper, we harness the dual role of text in this task, using it not only to provide constraint but also as a training signal. We introduce the Trajectory-level Textual Constraints Translator (TTCT) to replace the manually designed cost function. Our empirical results demonstrate that TTCT effectively comprehends textual constraint and trajectory, and the policies trained by TTCT can achieve a lower violation rate than the standard cost function. Extra studies are conducted to demonstrate that the TTCT has zero-shot transfer capability to adapt to constraint-shift environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Here our interest lies in understanding how individuals' health trajectories evolve in a nationwide longitudinal dataset with coded features, such as clinical codes, procedures, and drug purchases. We introduce a straightforward approach for training a Transformer-based deep learning model in a way that lets us analyze how individuals' trajectories change over time. This is achieved by modifying the training objective and by applying a causal attention mask. We focus here on a general task of predicting the onset of a range of common diseases in a given future forecast interval. However, instead of providing a single prediction about diagnoses that could occur in this forecast interval, our approach enable the model to provide continuous predictions at every time point up until, and conditioned on, the time of the forecast period. We find that this model performs comparably to other models, including a bi-directional transformer model, in terms of basic prediction performance while at the same time offering promising trajectory modeling properties. We explore a couple of ways to use this model for analyzing health trajectories and aiding in early detection of events that forecast possible later disease onsets. We hypothesize that this method may be helpful in continuous monitoring of peoples' health trajectories and enabling interventions in ongoing health trajectories, as well as being useful in retrospective analyses.</p></details> |  |

Moving objects trigger events with precise timestamps along their trajectory, enabling smooth continuous-time estimation. However, few works have attempted to optimize the information loss during event representation construction, imposing a ceiling on this task. Fully exploiting event cameras requires representations that simultaneously preserve fine-grained temporal information, stable and characteristic 2D visual features, and temporally consistent information density, an unmet challenge in existing representations. We introduce Labits: Layered Bidirectional Time Surfaces, a simple yet elegant representation designed to retain all these features. Additionally, we propose a dedicated module for extracting active pixel local optical flow (APLOF), significantly boosting the performance. Our approach achieves an impressive 49% reduction in trajectory end-point error (TEPE) compared to the previous state-of-the-art on the MultiFlow dataset.

However, motion plans and trajectories for soft manipulators are challenging to calculate due to their deformable nature and nonlinear dynamics. This article introduces a fast real-time trajectory generation approach for soft robot manipulators, which creates dynamically-feasible motions for arbitrary kinematically-feasible paths of the robot's end effector. Our insight is that piecewise constant curvature (PCC) dynamics models of soft robots can be differentially flat, therefore control inputs can be calculated algebraically rather than through a nonlinear differential equation. We prove this flatness under certain conditions, with the curvatures of the robot as the flat outputs. Our two-step trajectory generation approach uses an inverse kinematics procedure to calculate a motion plan of robot curvatures per end-effector position, then, our flatness diffeomorphism generates corresponding control inputs that respect velocity. We validate our approach through simulations of our representative soft robot manipulator along three different trajectories, demonstrating a margin of 23x faster than real-time at a frequency of 100 Hz. This approach could allow fast verifiable replanning of soft robots' motions in safety-critical physical environments, crucial for deployment in the real world.</p></details> |  |

Each joint has limits in the ranges of position, velocity and acceleration, the latter making jerks in joint space undesirable. The proposed approach takes this nonlinear optimization problem whose variables are path speed and joint trajectory and reformulates it into a bi-level problem. The lower-level formulation is a convex subproblem that considers a fixed joint trajectory and maximizes path speed while considering all joint velocity and acceleration constraints. Under particular conditions, this subproblem has a closed-form solution. Then, we solve a higher-level subproblem by leveraging the directional derivative of the lower-level value with respect to the joint trajectory parameters. In particular, we use this direction to implement a Primal-Dual method that considers the path accuracy and joint position constraints. We show the efficacy of our proposed approach with simulations and experimental results.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 14 pictures</p></details> |

Previous methods on controllable video generation primarily leverage 2D control signals to manipulate object motions and have achieved remarkable synthesis results. However, 2D control signals are inherently limited in expressing the 3D nature of object motions. To overcome this problem, we introduce 3DTrajMaster, a robust controller that regulates multi-entity dynamics in 3D space, given user-desired 6DoF pose (location and rotation) sequences of entities. At the core of our approach is a plug-and-play 3D-motion grounded object injector that fuses multiple input entities with their respective 3D trajectories through a gated self-attention mechanism. In addition, we exploit an injector architecture to preserve the video diffusion prior, which is crucial for generalization ability. To mitigate video quality degradation, we introduce a domain adaptor during training and employ an annealed sampling strategy during inference. To address the lack of suitable training data, we construct a 360-Motion Dataset, which first correlates collected 3D human and animal assets with GPT-generated trajectory and then captures their motion with 12 evenly-surround cameras on diverse 3D UE platforms. Extensive experiments show that 3DTrajMaster sets a new state-of-the-art in both accuracy and generalization for controlling multi-entity 3D motions.

However, these models have been shown to generate harmful content such as not-safe-for-work (NSFW) images. While approaches have been proposed to erase such abstract concepts from the models, jail-breaking techniques have succeeded in bypassing such safety measures. In this paper, we propose TraSCE, an approach to guide the diffusion trajectory away from generating harmful content. Our approach is based on negative prompting, but as we show in this paper, conventional negative prompting is not a complete solution and can easily be bypassed in some corner cases. To address this issue, we first propose a modification of conventional negative prompting. Furthermore, we introduce a localized loss-based guidance that enhances the modified negative prompting technique by steering the diffusion trajectory. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks in removing harmful content including ones proposed by red teams; and erasing artistic styles and objects. Our proposed approach does not require any training, weight modifications, or training data (both image or prompt), making it easier for model owners to erase new concepts.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to previous methods which often assume simplified geometries of the robot and object or do not explicitly model finger rolling, we propose a method to further extend the capabilities of dexterous manipulation by accounting for non-trivial geometries of both the robot and the object. By integrating the object's Signed Distance Field (SDF) with a sampling method, our method estimates contact and rolling-related variables in a differentiable manner and includes those in a trajectory optimization framework. This formulation naturally allows for the emergence of finger-rolling behaviors, enabling the robot to locally adjust the contact points. To evaluate our method, we introduce a benchmark featuring challenging multi-finger dexterous manipulation tasks, such as screwdriver turning and in-hand reorientation. Our method outperforms baselines in terms of achieving desired object configurations and avoiding dropping the object. We also successfully apply our method to a real-world screwdriver turning task and a cuboid alignment task, demonstrating its robustness to the sim2real gap.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this challenge, we extend our previous work on trajectory planning at unsignalized intersections using Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). The method utilizes the Adaptive Belief Tree (ABT) algorithm, an approximate sampling-based approach to solve POMDPs efficiently. We outline the POMDP formulation process, beginning with discretizing the highway topology to reduce problem complexity. Additionally, we describe the dynamics and measurement models used to predict future states and establish the relationship between available noisy measurements and predictions. Building on our previous work, the dynamics model is expanded to account for lateral movements necessary for lane changes during the merging process. We also define the reward function, which serves as the primary mechanism for specifying the desired behavior of the automated vehicle, combining multiple goals such as avoiding collisions or maintaining appropriate velocity. Our simulation results, conducted on three scenarios based on real-life traffic data from German highways, demonstrate the method's ability to generate safe, collision-free, and efficient merging trajectories. This work shows the versatility of this POMDP-based approach in tackling various automated driving problems.</p></details> |  |

Despite its benefits, the efficiency of FL is often restricted by the communication quality between IoT devices and the central server. To address this issue, we introduce an innovative approach by deploying an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a mobile FL server to enhance the training process of FL. By leveraging the UAV's maneuverability, we establish robust line-of-sight connections with IoT devices, significantly improving communication capacity. To improve the overall training efficiency, we formulate a latency minimization problem by jointly optimizing the bandwidth allocation, computing frequencies, transmit power for both the UAV and IoT devices, and the UAV's trajectory. Then, an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is developed to solve it efficiently. Furthermore, we analyze the convergence and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that our proposed scheme not only outperforms existing benchmark schemes in terms of latency but also achieves training efficiency that closely approximate the ideal scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to IEEE</p></details> |

However, before deploying UAVs in the real world, it is essential to ensure they can operate safely in complex environments, especially with limited communication capabilities. To address this challenge, we propose a control-aware learning-based trajectory prediction algorithm that can enable communication-efficient UAV swarm control in a cluttered environment. Specifically, our proposed algorithm can enable each UAV to predict the planned trajectories of its neighbors in scenarios with various levels of communication capabilities. The predicted planned trajectories will serve as input to a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) approach. The proposed algorithm combines (1) a trajectory prediction model based on EvolveGCN, a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) that can handle dynamic graphs, which is further enhanced by compressed messages from adjacent UAVs, and (2) a KKT-informed training approach that applies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions in the training process to encode DMPC information into the trained neural network. We evaluate our proposed algorithm in a funnel-like environment. Results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, providing close-to-optimal control performance and robustness to limited communication capabilities and measurement noises.</p></details> |  |
| **[ITPNet: Towards Instantaneous Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07369v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction of agents is crucial for the safety of autonomous vehicles, whereas previous approaches usually rely on sufficiently long-observed trajectory to predict the future trajectory of the agents. However, in real-world scenarios, it is not realistic to collect adequate observed locations for moving agents, leading to the collapse of most prediction models. For instance, when a moving car suddenly appears and is very close to an autonomous vehicle because of the obstruction, it is quite necessary for the autonomous vehicle to quickly and accurately predict the future trajectories of the car with limited observed trajectory locations. In light of this, we focus on investigating the task of instantaneous trajectory prediction, i.e., two observed locations are available during inference. To this end, we propose a general and plug-and-play instantaneous trajectory prediction approach, called ITPNet. Specifically, we propose a backward forecasting mechanism to reversely predict the latent feature representations of unobserved historical trajectories of the agent based on its two observed locations and then leverage them as complementary information for future trajectory prediction. Meanwhile, due to the inevitable existence of noise and redundancy in the predicted latent feature representations, we further devise a Noise Redundancy Reduction Former, aiming at to filter out noise and redundancy from unobserved trajectories and integrate the filtered features and observed features into a compact query for future trajectory predictions. In essence, ITPNet can be naturally compatible with existing trajectory prediction models, enabling them to gracefully handle the case of instantaneous trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse and nuScenes datasets demonstrate ITPNet outperforms the baselines, and its efficacy with different trajectory prediction models.</p></details> |  |

The trajectory generation exploits the state predictions of the USV to create periodically updated trajectories for a multirotor UAV to precisely land on the deck of a moving USV even in cases where the deck's inclination is continuously changing. We use an MPC-based scheme to create trajectories that consider both the UAV dynamics and the predicted states of the USV up to the first derivative of position and orientation. Compared to existing approaches, our method dynamically modifies the penalization matrices to precisely follow the corresponding states with respect to the flight phase. Especially during the landing maneuver, the UAV synchronizes attitude with the USV's, allowing for fast landing on a tilted deck. Simulations show the method's reliability in various sea conditions up to Rough sea (wave height 4 m), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in landing speed and accuracy, with twice the precision on average. Finally, real-world experiments validate the simulation results, demonstrating robust landings on a moving USV, while all computations are performed in real-time onboard the UAV.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 17 figures, Ocean Engineering</p></details> |

In this work, we investigate a mixed strategy in MF training that first pre-train motion forecasters on pseudo-labeled data, then fine-tune them on annotated data. To obtain pseudo-labeled trajectories, we propose a simple pipeline that leverages off-the-shelf single-frame 3D object detectors and non-learning trackers. The whole pre-training strategy including pseudo-labeling is coined as PPT. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that: (1) combining PPT with supervised fine-tuning on annotated data achieves superior performance on diverse testbeds, especially under annotation-efficient regimes, (2) scaling up to multiple datasets improves the previous state-of-the-art and (3) PPT helps enhance cross-dataset generalization. Our findings showcase PPT as a promising pre-training solution for robust motion forecasting in diverse autonomous driving contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parameter Adjustments in POMDP-Based Trajectory Planning for Unsignalized Intersections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06405v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the problem of trajectory planning for autonomous vehicles at unsignalized intersections, specifically focusing on scenarios where the vehicle lacks the right of way and yet must cross safely. To address this issue, we have employed a method based on the Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) framework designed for planning under uncertainty. The method utilizes the Adaptive Belief Tree (ABT) algorithm as an approximate solver for the POMDPs. We outline the POMDP formulation, beginning with discretizing the intersection's topology. Additionally, we present a dynamics model for the prediction of the evolving states of vehicles, such as their position and velocity. Using an observation model, we also describe the connection of those states with the imperfect (noisy) available measurements. Our results confirmed that the method is able to plan collision-free trajectories in a series of simulations utilizing real-world traffic data from aerial footage of two distinct intersections. Furthermore, we studied the impact of parameter adjustments of the ABT algorithm on the method's performance. This provides guidance in determining reasonable parameter settings, which is valuable for future method applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deterministic Trajectory Optimization through Probabilistic Optimal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13316v3)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we discuss two algorithms tailored to discrete-time deterministic finite-horizon nonlinear optimal control problems or so-called deterministic trajectory optimization problems. Both algorithms can be derived from an emerging theoretical paradigm that we refer to as probabilistic optimal control. The paradigm reformulates stochastic optimal control as an equivalent probabilistic inference problem and can be viewed as a generalisation of the former. The merit of this perspective is that it allows to address the problem using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. It is shown that the application of this algorithm results in a fixed point iteration of probabilistic policies that converge to the deterministic optimal policy. Two strategies for policy evaluation are discussed, using state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods resulting into two distinct algorithms. The algorithms are structurally closest related to the differential dynamic programming algorithm and related methods that use sigma-point methods to avoid direct gradient evaluations. The main advantage of the algorithms is an improved balance between exploration and exploitation over the iterations, leading to improved numerical stability and accelerated convergence. These properties are demonstrated on different nonlinear systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Data Representation for Motion Forecasting: A Scene-Specific Trajectory Set Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20732v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representing diverse and plausible future trajectories is critical for motion forecasting in autonomous driving. However, efficiently capturing these trajectories in a compact set remains challenging. This study introduces a novel approach for generating scene-specific trajectory sets tailored to different contexts, such as intersections and straight roads, by leveraging map information and actor dynamics. A deterministic goal sampling algorithm identifies relevant map regions, while our Recursive In-Distribution Subsampling (RIDS) method enhances trajectory plausibility by condensing redundant representations. Experiments on the Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 10% improvement in Driving Area Compliance (DAC) compared to baseline methods while maintaining competitive displacement errors. Our work highlights the benefits of mining such scene-aware trajectory sets and how they could capture the complex and heterogeneous nature of actor behavior in real-world driving scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Soft Driving Constraints from Vectorized Scene Embeddings while Imitating Expert Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05717v1)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The primary goal of motion planning is to generate safe and efficient trajectories for vehicles. Traditionally, motion planning models are trained using imitation learning to mimic the behavior of human experts. However, these models often lack interpretability and fail to provide clear justifications for their decisions. We propose a method that integrates constraint learning into imitation learning by extracting driving constraints from expert trajectories. Our approach utilizes vectorized scene embeddings that capture critical spatial and temporal features, enabling the model to identify and generalize constraints across various driving scenarios. We formulate the constraint learning problem using a maximum entropy model, which scores the motion planner's trajectories based on their similarity to the expert trajectory. By separating the scoring process into distinct reward and constraint streams, we improve both the interpretability of the planner's behavior and its attention to relevant scene components. Unlike existing constraint learning methods that rely on simulators and are typically embedded in reinforcement learning (RL) or inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) frameworks, our method operates without simulators, making it applicable to a wider range of datasets and real-world scenarios. Experimental results on the InD and TrafficJams datasets demonstrate that incorporating driving constraints enhances model interpretability and improves closed-loop performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[M$^3$PC: Test-time Model Predictive Control for Pretrained Masked Trajectory Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05675v1)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work in Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown that a unified Transformer trained under a masked auto-encoding objective can effectively capture the relationships between different modalities (e.g., states, actions, rewards) within given trajectory datasets. However, this information has not been fully exploited during the inference phase, where the agent needs to generate an optimal policy instead of just reconstructing masked components from unmasked ones. Given that a pretrained trajectory model can act as both a Policy Model and a World Model with appropriate mask patterns, we propose using Model Predictive Control (MPC) at test time to leverage the model's own predictive capability to guide its action selection. Empirical results on D4RL and RoboMimic show that our inference-phase MPC significantly improves the decision-making performance of a pretrained trajectory model without any additional parameter training. Furthermore, our framework can be adapted to Offline to Online (O2O) RL and Goal Reaching RL, resulting in more substantial performance gains when an additional online interaction budget is provided, and better generalization capabilities when different task targets are specified.

While existing 3D editing methods excel at modifying color, texture, and style, they struggle with extensive geometric or appearance changes, thus limiting their applications. We propose Perturb-and-Revise, which makes possible a variety of NeRF editing. First, we perturb the NeRF parameters with random initializations to create a versatile initialization. We automatically determine the perturbation magnitude through analysis of the local loss landscape. Then, we revise the edited NeRF via generative trajectories. Combined with the generative process, we impose identity-preserving gradients to refine the edited NeRF. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Perturb-and-Revise facilitates flexible, effective, and consistent editing of color, appearance, and geometry in 3D.

In recent years, generative AI models have demonstrated promising results in capturing short and long range dependencies in time series data. While these models have also been applied in healthcare, most of them only predict one value at a time, which is unrealistic in a clinical setting where multiple measures are taken at once. In this work, we extend the framework temporal fusion transformer (TFT), a multi-horizon time series prediction tool, and propose TFT-multi, an end-to-end framework that can predict multiple vital trajectories simultaneously. We apply TFT-multi to forecast 5 vital signs recorded in the intensive care unit: blood pressure, pulse, SpO2, temperature and respiratory rate. We hypothesize that by jointly predicting these measures, which are often correlated with one another, we can make more accurate predictions, especially in variables with large missingness. We validate our model on the public MIMIC dataset and an independent institutional dataset, and demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art univariate prediction tools including the original TFT and Prophet, as well as vector regression modeling for multivariate prediction. Furthermore, we perform a study case analysis by applying our pipeline to forecast blood pressure changes in response to actual and hypothetical pressor administration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Opt2Skill: Imitating Dynamically-feasible Whole-Body Trajectories for Versatile Humanoid Loco-Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20514v3)** | 2024-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid robots are designed to perform diverse loco-manipulation tasks. However, they face challenges due to their high-dimensional and unstable dynamics, as well as the complex contact-rich nature of the tasks. Model-based optimal control methods offer precise and systematic control but are limited by high computational complexity and accurate contact sensing. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) provides robustness and handles high-dimensional spaces but suffers from inefficient learning, unnatural motion, and sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Opt2Skill, an end-to-end pipeline that combines model-based trajectory optimization with RL to achieve robust whole-body loco-manipulation. We generate reference motions for the Digit humanoid robot using differential dynamic programming (DDP) and train RL policies to track these trajectories. Our results demonstrate that Opt2Skill outperforms pure RL methods in both training efficiency and task performance, with optimal trajectories that account for torque limits enhancing trajectory tracking. We successfully transfer our approach to real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Accurate forecasting requires a comprehensive understanding not only of each pedestrian's previous trajectory but also of their interaction with the surrounding environment, an important part of which are other pedestrians moving dynamically in the scene. To learn effective socially-informed representations, we propose a model that uses a reconstructor alongside a conditional variational autoencoder-based trajectory forecasting module. This module generates pseudo-trajectories, which we use as augmentations throughout the training process. To further guide the model towards social awareness, we propose a novel social loss that aids in forecasting of more stable trajectories. We validate our approach through extensive experiments, demonstrating strong performances in comparison to state of-the-art methods on the ETH/UCY and SDD benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2025</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we introduce an effective and scalable data selection method for SFT, SmallToLarge (S2L), which leverages training trajectories from small models to guide the data selection for larger models. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that S2L significantly improves data efficiency in SFT for mathematical problem-solving, reducing the training data to just 11% of the original MathInstruct dataset (Yue et al., 2023) to match full dataset performance while outperforming state-of-the-art data selection algorithms by an average of 4.7% across 6 in- and out-domain evaluation datasets. Remarkably, selecting only 50K data for SFT, S2L achieves a 32.7% accuracy on the most challenging MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) benchmark, improving Phi-2 (Li et al., 2023b) by 16.6%. In clinical text summarization on the MIMIC-III dataset (Johnson et al., 2016), S2L again outperforms training on the full dataset using only 50% of the data. Notably, S2L can perform data selection using a reference model 40x smaller than the target model, proportionally reducing the cost of data selection.</p></details> |  |

Most modern trajectory planning techniques rely on numerical optimization because high-quality, expressive trajectories that satisfy various constraints can be systematically computed. However, meeting computation time constraints and the potential for numerical instabilities can limit the use of optimization-based planners in safety-critical scenarios. This work presents an optimization-free planning framework that stitches short trajectory segments together with graph search to compute long range, expressive, and near-optimal trajectories in real-time. Our STITCHER algorithm is shown to outperform modern optimization-based planners through our innovative planning architecture and several algorithmic developments that make real-time planning possible. Extensive simulation testing is conducted to analyze the algorithmic components that make up STITCHER, and a thorough comparison with two state-of-the-art optimization planners is performed. It is shown STITCHER can generate trajectories through complex environments over long distances (tens of meters) with low computation times (milliseconds).</p></details> | V1 Draft |

Trajectory prediction spans both short-term and long-term horizons, each requiring distinct considerations: short-term predictions rely on accurately capturing the vehicle's dynamics, while long-term predictions rely on accurately modeling the interaction patterns within the environment. However current approaches, either physics-based or learning-based models, always ignore these distinct considerations, making them struggle to find the optimal prediction for both short-term and long-term horizon. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamics-Enhanced Learning MOdel (DEMO), a novel approach that combines a physics-based Vehicle Dynamics Model with advanced deep learning algorithms. DEMO employs a two-stage architecture, featuring a Dynamics Learning Stage and an Interaction Learning Stage, where the former stage focuses on capturing vehicle motion dynamics and the latter focuses on modeling interaction. By capitalizing on the respective strengths of both methods, DEMO facilitates multi-horizon predictions for future trajectories. Experimental results on the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM), Macau Connected Autonomous Driving (MoCAD), Highway Drone (HighD), and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that DEMO outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines in both short-term and long-term prediction horizons.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Information Fusion</p></details> |

However, EEG source imaging (ESI) based kinematics prediction is sparsely explored in the literature. In this study, pre-movement EEG features are utilized to predict three-dimensional (3D) hand kinematics for the grasp-and-lift motor task. A public dataset, WAY-EEG-GAL, is utilized for MKP analysis. In particular, sensor-domain (EEG data) and source-domain (ESI data) based features from the frontoparietal region are explored for MKP. Deep learning-based models are explored to achieve efficient kinematics decoding. Various time-lagged and window sizes are analyzed for hand kinematics prediction. Subsequently, intra-subject and inter-subject MKP analysis is performed to investigate the subject-specific and subject-independent motor-learning capabilities of the neural decoders. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is used as the performance metric for kinematics trajectory decoding. The rEEGNet neural decoder achieved the best performance with sensor-domain and source-domain features with a time lag and window size of 100 ms and 450 ms, respectively. The highest mean PCC values of 0.790, 0.795, and 0.637 are achieved using sensor-domain features, while 0.769, 0.777, and 0.647 are achieved using source-domain features in x, y, and z-directions, respectively. This study explores the feasibility of trajectory prediction using EEG sensor-domain and source-domain EEG features for the grasp-and-lift task. Furthermore, inter-subject trajectory estimation is performed using the proposed deep learning decoder with EEG source domain features.</p></details> |  |

In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in the synthesis of controllers for systems with complex dynamics and modest online compute budgets. However, the poor sample efficiency of RL and the challenges of reward design make training slow and sometimes unstable, especially for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we leverage the inherent Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional "quotient" MDP to be lifted to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fully-actuated space robot), and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error after the same number of training steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally to this work.

In the case of numerical solution, it is dependent on the original optimal control problem, the choice of a control transcription, and the behavior of a gradient based numerical solver. In this paper we formulate the parameterized global search problem as the task of sampling a conditional probability distribution with support on the neighborhoods of local basins of attraction to the high quality solutions. The conditional distribution is learned and represented using deep generative models that allow for prediction of how the local basins change as parameters vary. The approach is benchmarked on a low thrust spacecraft trajectory optimization problem in the circular restricted three-body problem, showing significant speed-up over a simple multi-start method and vanilla machine learning approaches.

Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods. Our codes, data, and checkpoints are available at \href{https://qiushisun.github.io/OS-Genesis-Home/}{OS-Genesis Homepage}.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[A data driven approach to classify descriptors based on their efficiency in translating noisy trajectories into physically-relevant information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12570v3)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing the physical complexity of many-body dynamical systems can be challenging. Starting from the trajectories of their constitutive units (raw data), typical approaches require selecting appropriate descriptors to convert them into time-series, which are then analyzed to extract interpretable information. However, identifying the most effective descriptor is often non-trivial. Here, we report a data-driven approach to compare the efficiency of various descriptors in extracting information from noisy trajectories and translating it into physically relevant insights. As a prototypical system with non-trivial internal complexity, we analyze molecular dynamics trajectories of an atomistic system where ice and water coexist in equilibrium near the solid/liquid transition temperature. We compare general and specific descriptors often used in aqueous systems: number of neighbors, molecular velocities, Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP), Local Environments and Neighbors Shuffling (LENS), Orientational Tetrahedral Order, and distance from the fifth neighbor ($d_5$). Using Onion Clustering -- an efficient unsupervised method for single-point time-series analysis -- we assess the maximum extractable information for each descriptor and rank them via a high-dimensional metric. Our results show that advanced descriptors like SOAP and LENS outperform classical ones due to higher signal-to-noise ratios. Nonetheless, even simple descriptors can rival or exceed advanced ones after local signal denoising. For example, $d_5$, initially among the weakest, becomes the most effective at resolving the system's non-local dynamical complexity after denoising. This work highlights the critical role of noise in information extraction from molecular trajectories and offers a data-driven approach to identify optimal descriptors for systems with characteristic internal complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures + 3 in supporting information (at the bottom of the manuscript)</p></details> |
| **[TrajGEOS: Trajectory Graph Enhanced Orientation-based Sequential Network for Mobility Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19092v1)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human mobility studies how people move to access their needed resources and plays a significant role in urban planning and location-based services. As a paramount task of human mobility modeling, next location prediction is challenging because of the diversity of users' historical trajectories that gives rise to complex mobility patterns and various contexts. Deep sequential models have been widely used to predict the next location by leveraging the inherent sequentiality of trajectory data. However, they do not fully leverage the relationship between locations and fail to capture users' multi-level preferences. This work constructs a trajectory graph from users' historical traces and proposes a \textbf{Traj}ectory \textbf{G}raph \textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{O}rientation-based \textbf{S}equential network (TrajGEOS) for next-location prediction tasks. TrajGEOS introduces hierarchical graph convolution to capture location and user embeddings. Such embeddings consider not only the contextual feature of locations but also the relation between them, and serve as additional features in downstream modules. In addition, we design an orientation-based module to learn users' mid-term preferences from sequential modeling modules and their recent trajectories. Extensive experiments on three real-world LBSN datasets corroborate the value of graph and orientation-based modules and demonstrate that TrajGEOS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the next location prediction task.</p></details> |  |

While several CTP methods have been developed for this problem, we posit that none of these methods (1) jointly considers the mutual ternary dependency between three key units (i.e., user, position, and company) of a career and (2) captures the characteristic shifts of key units in career over time, leading to an inaccurate understanding of the job movement patterns in the labor market. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel solution, named as CAPER, that solves the challenges via sophisticated temporal knowledge graph (TKG) modeling. It enables the utilization of a graph-structured knowledge base with rich expressiveness, effectively preserving the changes in job movement patterns. Furthermore, we devise an extrapolated career reasoning task on TKG for a realistic evaluation. The experiments on a real-world career trajectory dataset demonstrate that CAPER consistently and significantly outperforms four baselines, two recent TKG reasoning methods, and five state-of-the-art CTP methods in predicting one's future companies and positions--i.e., on average, yielding 6.80% and 34.58% more accurate predictions, respectively.

| **[Single Trajectory Distillation for Accelerating Image and Video Style Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18945v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based stylization methods typically denoise from a specific partial noise state for image-to-image and video-to-video tasks. This multi-step diffusion process is computationally expensive and hinders real-world application. A promising solution to speed up the process is to obtain few-step consistency models through trajectory distillation. However, current consistency models only force the initial-step alignment between the probability flow ODE (PF-ODE) trajectories of the student and the imperfect teacher models. This training strategy can not ensure the consistency of whole trajectories. To address this issue, we propose single trajectory distillation (STD) starting from a specific partial noise state. We introduce a trajectory bank to store the teacher model's trajectory states, mitigating the time cost during training. Besides, we use an asymmetric adversarial loss to enhance the style and quality of the generated images. Extensive experiments on image and video stylization demonstrate that our method surpasses existing acceleration models in terms of style similarity and aesthetic evaluations. Our code and results will be available on the project page: https://single-trajectory-distillation.github.io.</p></details> |  |

Existing solutions directly train a generative model for observed trajectories and calculate the conditional generative probability $P({T}|{C})$ as the anomaly risk, where ${T}$ and ${C}$ represent the trajectory and SD pair respectively. However, we argue that the observed trajectories are confounded by road network preference which is a common cause of both SD distribution and trajectories. Existing methods ignore this issue limiting their generalization ability on out-of-distribution trajectories. In this paper, we define the debiased trajectory anomaly detection problem and propose a causal implicit generative model, namely CausalTAD, to solve it. CausalTAD adopts do-calculus to eliminate the confounding bias of road network preference and estimates $P({T}|do({C}))$ as the anomaly criterion. Extensive experiments show that CausalTAD can not only achieve superior performance on trained trajectories but also generally improve the performance of out-of-distribution data, with improvements of $2.1\% \sim 5.7\%$ and $10.6\% \sim 32.7\%$ respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2024</p></details> |

In response, this paper introduces a novel framework that utilizes audio array for 3D UAV trajectory estimation. Our approach incorporates a self-supervised learning model, starting with the conversion of audio data into mel-spectrograms, which are analyzed through an encoder to extract crucial temporal and spectral information. Simultaneously, UAV trajectories are estimated using LiDAR point clouds via unsupervised methods. These LiDAR-based estimations act as pseudo labels, enabling the training of an Audio Perception Network without requiring labeled data. In this architecture, the LiDAR-based system operates as the Teacher Network, guiding the Audio Perception Network, which serves as the Student Network. Once trained, the model can independently predict 3D trajectories using only audio signals, with no need for LiDAR data or external ground truth during deployment. To further enhance precision, we apply Gaussian Process modeling for improved spatiotemporal tracking. Our method delivers top-tier performance on the MMAUD dataset, establishing a new benchmark in trajectory estimation using self-supervised learning techniques without reliance on ground truth annotations.</p></details> | Accepted for ICASSP |

To predict the states of the system, the Holt's exponential smoothing techniques and nonlinear dynamic equations of gas pipelines are applied to establish the power and gas system equations, respectively. The square-root cubature Kalman filter algorithm is utilized to address the numerical challenges posed by the strongly nonlinear system equations. The boundary conditions in the gas system include the flow balances at sink nodes, and the mass flow rates of loads have to be predicted at each computation step. For the prediction of load mass flows, the long short-term memory network is employed, known for its effectiveness in time series prediction. Consequently, a combined method based on the square-root cubature Kalman filter and the long short-term memory network is proposed for tracking integrated gas and power systems. To evaluate the tracking performances of the proposed method, the IEEE-39 bus power system and GasLib-40 node gas system are used to form the testing system. Simulation results demonstrate high precision in tracking the dynamic states of power and gas systems. Two indexes are introduced for a numerical analysis of the tracking results, indicating that the accuracy of this method surpasses that of traditional measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we present TAME, the Temporal Audio-based Mamba for Enhanced Drone Trajectory Estimation and Classification. This innovative anti-UAV detection model leverages a parallel selective state-space model to simultaneously capture and learn both the temporal and spectral features of audio, effectively analyzing propagation of sound. To further enhance temporal features, we introduce a Temporal Feature Enhancement Module, which integrates spectral features into temporal data using residual cross-attention. This enhanced temporal information is then employed for precise 3D trajectory estimation and classification.

Key contributions include the quantum-based state transitions, return calculation, and trajectory search mechanism that utilize quantum principles to demonstrate the realization of RL processes through quantum phenomena. The implementation emphasizes the fundamental role of quantum superposition in enhancing computational efficiency for RL tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the capacity of a quantum model to achieve quantum advantage in RL, highlighting the potential of fully quantum implementations in decision-making tasks.

Although considerable research efforts have been made recently, the inherent trajectory uncertainty caused by various factors including the dynamic driving intends and the diverse driving scenarios still poses significant challenges to accurate trajectory prediction. To address this issue, we propose C2F-TP, a coarse-to-fine denoising framework for uncertainty-aware vehicle trajectory prediction. C2F-TP features an innovative two-stage coarse-to-fine prediction process. Specifically, in the spatial-temporal interaction stage, we propose a spatial-temporal interaction module to capture the inter-vehicle interactions and learn a multimodal trajectory distribution, from which a certain number of noisy trajectories are sampled. Next, in the trajectory refinement stage, we design a conditional denoising model to reduce the uncertainty of the sampled trajectories through a step-wise denoising operation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real datasets NGSIM and highD that are widely adopted in trajectory prediction. The result demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Addressing and Visualizing Misalignments in Human Task-Solving Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14191v2)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of AI model training hinges on the quality of the trajectory data used, particularly in aligning the model's decision with human intentions. However, in the human task-solving trajectories, we observe significant misalignments between human intentions and the recorded trajectories, which can undermine AI model training. This paper addresses the challenges of these misalignments by proposing a visualization tool and a heuristic algorithm designed to detect and categorize discrepancies in trajectory data. Although the heuristic algorithm requires a set of predefined human intentions to function, which we currently cannot extract, the visualization tool offers valuable insights into the nature of these misalignments. We expect that eliminating these misalignments could significantly improve the utility of trajectory data for AI model training. We also propose that future work should focus on developing methods, such as Topic Modeling, to accurately extract human intentions from trajectory data, thereby enhancing the alignment between user actions and AI learning processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Similarity Trajectories: Linking Sampling Process to Artifacts in Diffusion-Generated Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17109v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artifact detection algorithms are crucial to correcting the output generated by diffusion models. However, because of the variety of artifact forms, existing methods require substantial annotated data for training. This requirement limits their scalability and efficiency, which restricts their wide application. This paper shows that the similarity of denoised images between consecutive time steps during the sampling process is related to the severity of artifacts in images generated by diffusion models. Building on this observation, we introduce the concept of Similarity Trajectory to characterize the sampling process and its correlation with the image artifacts presented. Using an annotated data set of 680 images, which is only 0.1% of the amount of data used in the prior work, we trained a classifier on these trajectories to predict the presence of artifacts in images. By performing 10-fold validation testing on the balanced annotated data set, the classifier can achieve an accuracy of 72.35%, highlighting the connection between the Similarity Trajectory and the occurrence of artifacts. This approach enables differentiation between artifact-exhibiting and natural-looking images using limited training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyperNet Fields: Efficiently Training Hypernetworks without Ground Truth by Learning Weight Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17040v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To efficiently adapt large models or to train generative models of neural representations, Hypernetworks have drawn interest. While hypernetworks work well, training them is cumbersome, and often requires ground truth optimized weights for each sample. However, obtaining each of these weights is a training problem of its own-one needs to train, e.g., adaptation weights or even an entire neural field for hypernetworks to regress to. In this work, we propose a method to train hypernetworks, without the need for any per-sample ground truth. Our key idea is to learn a Hypernetwork `Field` and estimate the entire trajectory of network weight training instead of simply its converged state. In other words, we introduce an additional input to the Hypernetwork, the convergence state, which then makes it act as a neural field that models the entire convergence pathway of a task network. A critical benefit in doing so is that the gradient of the estimated weights at any convergence state must then match the gradients of the original task -- this constraint alone is sufficient to train the Hypernetwork Field. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through the task of personalized image generation and 3D shape reconstruction from images and point clouds, demonstrating competitive results without any per-sample ground truth.</p></details> |  |
| **[Swept Volume-Aware Trajectory Planning and MPC Tracking for Multi-Axle Swerve-Drive AMRs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16875v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-axle autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) are set to revolutionize the future of robotics in logistics. As the backbone of next-generation solutions, these robots face a critical challenge: managing and minimizing the swept volume during turns while maintaining precise control. Traditional systems designed for standard vehicles often struggle with the complex dynamics of multi-axle configurations, leading to inefficiency and increased safety risk in confined spaces. Our innovative framework overcomes these limitations by combining swept volume minimization with Signed Distance Field (SDF) path planning and model predictive control (MPC) for independent wheel steering. This approach not only plans paths with an awareness of the swept volume but actively minimizes it in real-time, allowing each axle to follow a precise trajectory while significantly reducing the space the vehicle occupies. By predicting future states and adjusting the turning radius of each wheel, our method enhances both maneuverability and safety, even in the most constrained environments. Unlike previous works, our solution goes beyond basic path calculation and tracking, offering real-time path optimization with minimal swept volume and efficient individual axle control. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive approach to tackle these challenges, delivering life-saving improvements in control, efficiency, and safety for multi-axle AMRs. Furthermore, we will open-source our work to foster collaboration and enable others to advance safer, more efficient autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Efficient MPPI Trajectory Generation with Unscented Guidance: U-MPPI Control Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12369v3)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The classical Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control framework, while effective in many applications, lacks reliable safety features due to its reliance on a risk-neutral trajectory evaluation technique, which can present challenges for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Furthermore, when the majority of MPPI sampled trajectories concentrate in high-cost regions, it may generate an infeasible control sequence. To address this challenge, we propose the U-MPPI control strategy, a novel methodology that can effectively manage system uncertainties while integrating a more efficient trajectory sampling strategy. The core concept is to leverage the Unscented Transform (UT) to propagate not only the mean but also the covariance of the system dynamics, going beyond the traditional MPPI method. As a result, it introduces a novel and more efficient trajectory sampling strategy, significantly enhancing state-space exploration and ultimately reducing the risk of being trapped in local minima. Furthermore, by leveraging the uncertainty information provided by UT, we incorporate a risk-sensitive cost function that explicitly accounts for risk or uncertainty throughout the trajectory evaluation process, resulting in a more resilient control system capable of handling uncertain conditions. By conducting extensive simulations of 2D aggressive autonomous navigation in both known and unknown cluttered environments, we verify the efficiency and robustness of our proposed U-MPPI control strategy compared to the baseline MPPI. We further validate the practicality of U-MPPI through real-world demonstrations in unknown cluttered environments, showcasing its superior ability to incorporate both the UT and local costmap into the optimization problem without introducing additional complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper comprises 20 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables, 1 algorithm, and 1 appendix.

| **[Surrogate Modeling of Trajectory Map-matching in Urban Road Networks using Transformer Sequence-to-Sequence Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12460v3)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale geolocation telematics data acquired from connected vehicles has the potential to significantly enhance mobility infrastructures and operational systems within smart cities. To effectively utilize this data, it is essential to accurately match the geolocation data to the road segments. However, this matching is often not trivial due to the low sampling rate and errors exacerbated by multipath effects in urban environments. Traditionally, statistical modeling techniques such as Hidden-Markov models incorporating domain knowledge into the matching process have been extensively used for map-matching tasks. However, rule-based map-matching tasks are noise-sensitive and inefficient in processing large-scale trajectory data. Deep learning techniques directly learn the relationship between observed data and road networks from the data, often without the need for hand-crafted rules or domain knowledge. This renders them an efficient approach for map-matching large-scale datasets and more robust to the noise. This paper introduces a deep-learning model, specifically the transformer-based encoder-decoder model, to perform as a surrogate for offline map-matching algorithms. The encoder-decoder architecture initially encodes the series of noisy GPS points into a representation that automatically captures hidden contextual structures and spatial correlations between GPS points. Subsequently, the decoder associates data points with the road network features and thus transforms these representations into a sequence of road segments. The model is trained and evaluated using GPS traces collected in Manhattan, New York. Achieving an accuracy of 75%, transformer-based encoder-decoder models extensively employed in natural language processing presented a promising performance for translating noisy GPS data to the navigated routes in urban road networks.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

With the capability to simulate up to 2 million vehicles in real time, the system is scalable for large-scale trajectory optimization. We show that we can use the simulator to filter noise in the input trajectories (trajectory filtering), reconstruct dense trajectories from sparse ones (trajectory reconstruction), and predict future trajectories (trajectory prediction), with all generated trajectories adhering to physical laws.

| **[Choice Between Partial Trajectories: Disentangling Goals from Beliefs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22690v3)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI agents generate increasingly sophisticated behaviors, manually encoding human preferences to guide these agents becomes more challenging. To address this, it has been suggested that agents instead learn preferences from human choice data. This approach requires a model of choice behavior that the agent can use to interpret the data. For choices between partial trajectories of states and actions, previous models assume choice probabilities are determined by the partial return or the cumulative advantage. We consider an alternative model based instead on the bootstrapped return, which adds to the partial return an estimate of the future return. Benefits of the bootstrapped return model stem from its treatment of human beliefs. Unlike partial return, choices based on bootstrapped return reflect human beliefs about the environment. Further, while recovering the reward function from choices based on cumulative advantage requires that those beliefs are correct, doing so from choices based on bootstrapped return does not. To motivate the bootstrapped return model, we formulate axioms and prove an Alignment Theorem. This result formalizes how, for a general class of preferences, such models are able to disentangle goals from beliefs. This ensures recovery of an aligned reward function when learning from choices based on bootstrapped return. The bootstrapped return model also affords greater robustness to choice behavior. Even when choices are based on partial return, learning via a bootstrapped return model recovers an aligned reward function. The same holds with choices based on the cumulative advantage if the human and the agent both adhere to correct and consistent beliefs about the environment. On the other hand, if choices are based on bootstrapped return, learning via partial return or cumulative advantage models does not generally produce an aligned reward function.</p></details> |  |
| **[Effective and Efficient Representation Learning for Flight Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16581v1)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flight trajectory data plays a vital role in the traffic management community, especially for downstream tasks such as trajectory prediction, flight recognition, and anomaly detection. Existing works often utilize handcrafted features and design models for different tasks individually, which heavily rely on domain expertise and are hard to extend. We argue that different flight analysis tasks share the same useful features of the trajectory. Jointly learning a unified representation for flight trajectories could be beneficial for improving the performance of various tasks. However, flight trajectory representation learning (TRL) faces two primary challenges, \ie unbalanced behavior density and 3D spatial continuity, which disable recent general TRL methods. In this paper, we propose Flight2Vec , a flight-specific representation learning method to address these challenges. Specifically, a behavior-adaptive patching mechanism is used to inspire the learned representation to pay more attention to behavior-dense segments. Moreover, we introduce a motion trend learning technique that guides the model to memorize not only the precise locations, but also the motion trend to generate better representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Flight2Vec significantly improves performance in downstream tasks such as flight trajectory prediction, flight recognition, and anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Previous studies have tried to tackle this problem by leveraging a portion of the trajectory data from the target domain to adapt the model. However, such domain adaptation methods are impractical in real-world scenarios, as it is infeasible to collect trajectory data from all potential target domains. In this paper, we study a task named generalized pedestrian trajectory prediction, with the aim of generalizing the model to unseen domains without accessing their trajectories. To tackle this task, we introduce a Recurrent Aligned Network~(RAN) to minimize the domain gap through domain alignment. Specifically, we devise a recurrent alignment module to effectively align the trajectory feature spaces at both time-state and time-sequence levels by the recurrent alignment strategy.Furthermore, we introduce a pre-aligned representation module to combine social interactions with the recurrent alignment strategy, which aims to consider social interactions during the alignment process instead of just target trajectories. We extensively evaluate our method and compare it with state-of-the-art methods on three widely used benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate the superior generalization capability of our method. Our work not only fills the gap in the generalization setting for practical pedestrian trajectory prediction but also sets strong baselines in this field.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately modeling step-wise rewards from trajectory-level preference feedback presents inherent challenges. The reward bias introduced, particularly the overestimation of predicted rewards, leads to optimistic trajectory stitching, which undermines the pessimism mechanism critical to the offline RL phase. To address this challenge, we propose In-Dataset Trajectory Return Regularization (DTR) for offline PbRL, which leverages conditional sequence modeling to mitigate the risk of learning inaccurate trajectory stitching under reward bias. Specifically, DTR employs Decision Transformer and TD-Learning to strike a balance between maintaining fidelity to the behavior policy with high in-dataset trajectory returns and selecting optimal actions based on high reward labels. Additionally, we introduce an ensemble normalization technique that effectively integrates multiple reward models, balancing the tradeoff between reward differentiation and accuracy. Empirical evaluations on various benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DTR over other state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, Proceedings of the 39th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-25)</p></details> |

In complex scenarios like sports, agents' trajectories are influenced by group interactions and intentions, including team strategies and opponent actions. To this end, we propose a novel diffusion-based trajectory prediction framework that integrates group-level interactions into a conditional diffusion model, enabling the generation of diverse trajectories aligned with specific group activity. To capture dynamic semantic intentions, we frame group interaction prediction as a cooperative game, using Banzhaf interaction to model cooperation trends. We then fuse semantic intentions with enhanced agent embeddings, which are refined through both global and local aggregation. Furthermore, we expand the NBA SportVU dataset by adding human annotations of team-level tactics for trajectory and tactic prediction tasks.

Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[LeviTor: 3D Trajectory Oriented Image-to-Video Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15214v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The intuitive nature of drag-based interaction has led to its growing adoption for controlling object trajectories in image-to-video synthesis. Still, existing methods that perform dragging in the 2D space usually face ambiguity when handling out-of-plane movements. In this work, we augment the interaction with a new dimension, i.e., the depth dimension, such that users are allowed to assign a relative depth for each point on the trajectory. That way, our new interaction paradigm not only inherits the convenience from 2D dragging, but facilitates trajectory control in the 3D space, broadening the scope of creativity. We propose a pioneering method for 3D trajectory control in image-to-video synthesis by abstracting object masks into a few cluster points. These points, accompanied by the depth information and the instance information, are finally fed into a video diffusion model as the control signal. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, dubbed LeviTor, in precisely manipulating the object movements when producing photo-realistic videos from static images.

| **[STRAP: Robot Sub-Trajectory Retrieval for Augmented Policy Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15182v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot learning is witnessing a significant increase in the size, diversity, and complexity of pre-collected datasets, mirroring trends in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. Many robot learning methods treat such datasets as multi-task expert data and learn a multi-task, generalist policy by training broadly across them. Notably, while these generalist policies can improve the average performance across many tasks, the performance of generalist policies on any one task is often suboptimal due to negative transfer between partitions of the data, compared to task-specific specialist policies. In this work, we argue for the paradigm of training policies during deployment given the scenarios they encounter: rather than deploying pre-trained policies to unseen problems in a zero-shot manner, we non-parametrically retrieve and train models directly on relevant data at test time. Furthermore, we show that many robotics tasks share considerable amounts of low-level behaviors and that retrieval at the "sub"-trajectory granularity enables significantly improved data utilization, generalization, and robustness in adapting policies to novel problems. In contrast, existing full-trajectory retrieval methods tend to underutilize the data and miss out on shared cross-task content. This work proposes STRAP, a technique for leveraging pre-trained vision foundation models and dynamic time warping to retrieve sub-sequences of trajectories from large training corpora in a robust fashion. STRAP outperforms both prior retrieval algorithms and multi-task learning methods in simulated and real experiments, showing the ability to scale to much larger offline datasets in the real world as well as the ability to learn robust control policies with just a handful of real-world demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website at https://weirdlabuw.github.io/strap/</p></details> |

Diffusion is an iterative algorithm in which samples are generated step-by-step, starting from pure noise. This process introduces the notion of diffusion trajectories, i.e., paths from the standard Gaussian distribution to the target image distribution. In this context, we study discriminative algorithms operating on these trajectories. Specifically, given a pre-trained diffusion model, we consider the problem of classifying images as part of the training dataset, generated by the model or originating from an external source. Our approach demonstrates the presence of patterns across steps that can be leveraged for classification. We also conduct ablation studies, which reveal that using higher-order gradient features to characterize the trajectories leads to significant performance gains and more robust algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction with Difficulty-Guided Feature Enhancement Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18551v3)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving as it aims to forecast the future movements of traffic participants. Traditional methods usually perform holistic inference on the trajectories of agents, neglecting the differences in prediction difficulty among agents. This paper proposes a novel Difficulty-Guided Feature Enhancement Network (DGFNet), which leverages the prediction difficulty differences among agents for multi-agent trajectory prediction. Firstly, we employ spatio-temporal feature encoding and interaction to capture rich spatio-temporal features. Secondly, a difficulty-guided decoder controls the flow of future trajectories into subsequent modules, obtaining reliable future trajectories. Then, feature interaction and fusion are performed through the future feature interaction module. Finally, the fused agent features are fed into the final predictor to generate the predicted trajectory distributions for multiple participants. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Argoverse 1\&2 motion forecasting benchmarks. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each module. Moreover, compared with SOTA methods, our method balances trajectory prediction accuracy and real-time inference speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-Accuracy Model Predictive Control with Inverse Hysteresis for High-Speed Trajectory Tracking of Piezoelectric Fast Steering Mirror](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14511v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Piezoelectric fast steering mirrors (PFSM) are widely utilized in beam precision-pointing systems but encounter considerable challenges in achieving high-precision tracking of fast trajectories due to nonlinear hysteresis and mechanical dual-axis cross-coupling. This paper proposes a model predictive control (MPC) approach integrated with a hysteresis inverse based on the Hammerstein modeling structure of the PFSM. The MPC is designed to decouple the rate-dependent dual-axis linear components, with an augmented error integral variable introduced in the state space to eliminate steady-state errors. Moreover, proofs of zero steady-state error and disturbance rejection are provided. The hysteresis inverse model is then cascaded to compensate for the rate-independent nonlinear components. Finally, PFSM tracking experiments are conducted on step, sinusoidal, triangular, and composite trajectories. Compared to traditional model-free and existing model-based controllers, the proposed method significantly enhances tracking accuracy, demonstrating superior tracking performance and robustness to frequency variations. These results offer valuable insights for engineering applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[EPN: An Ego Vehicle Planning-Informed Network for Target Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14442v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction plays a crucial role in improving the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles, serving as an intermediate link between perception and planning. However, due to the highly dynamic and multimodal nature of the task, accurately predicting the future trajectory of a target vehicle remains a significant challenge. To address these challenges, we propose an Ego vehicle Planning-informed Network (EPN) for multimodal trajectory prediction. Current trajectory prediction methods typically use the historical trajectory and vehicle attributes as inputs, focusing primarily on how historical information influences the future trajectory of the target vehicle. In real-world driving scenarios, however, the future trajectory of a vehicle is influenced not only by its own historical data but also by the behavior of other vehicles on the road. To address this, we incorporate the future planned trajectory of the ego vehicle as an additional input to simulate the mutual influence between the ego vehicle's planned trajectory and the predicted trajectory of the target vehicle. Furthermore, to tackle the challenges of intention ambiguity and large prediction errors often encountered in methods based on driving intentions, we propose a target's endpoint prediction module. This module first predicts the possible endpoints of the target vehicle, then refines these predictions through a correction mechanism, and finally generates a complete multimodal predicted trajectory based on the corrected endpoints. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to other trajectory prediction methods, EPN achieves an average reduction of 34.9%, 30.7%, and 30.4% in RMSE, ADE, and FDE evaluation metrics on the NGSIM dataset, and an average reduction of 64.6%, 64.5%, and 64.3% in RMSE, ADE, and FDE on the HighD dataset. These results highlight the strong performance of EPN in trajectory prediction.</p></details> |  |

To overcome these challenges, we propose the RElevance, Proximity, and Validation-Enhanced Cooperative Language Agent (REVECA), a novel cognitive architecture powered by GPT-4o-mini. REVECA enables efficient memory management, optimal planning, and cost-effective prevention of false planning by leveraging Relevance Estimation, Adaptive Planning, and Trajectory-based Validation.

Factors such as demographics, genetic conditions, and lifestyle contribute to diverse phenotypical manifestations, necessitating patient stratification based on these variations. Recent methods like Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) have advanced unsupervised stratification of disease trajectories, but they face potential limitations in robustness, interpretability, and temporal granularity. To address these challenges, we introduce Disease Progression Modelling and Stratification (DP-MoSt), a novel probabilistic method that optimises clusters of continuous trajectories over a long-term disease time-axis while estimating the confidence of trajectory sub-types for each biomarker. We validate DP-MoSt using both synthetic and real-world data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). Our results demonstrate that DP-MoSt effectively identifies both sub-trajectories and subpopulations, and is a promising alternative to current state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Longi...</summary><p>Longitudinal Disease Tracking and Modelling with Medical Images and Data, Oct 2024, Marrachech, Morocco</p></details> |

This work explores the integration of Transformer based model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based technique to enhance spatial and temporal feature learning in vehicle trajectory prediction. Here, a hybrid model that combines LSTMs for temporal encoding with a Transformer encoder for capturing complex interactions between vehicles is proposed. Spatial trajectory features of the neighboring vehicles are processed and goes through a masked scatter mechanism in a grid based environment, which is then combined with temporal trajectory of the vehicles. This combined trajectory data are learned by sequential LSTM encoding and Transformer based attention layers. The proposed model is benchmarked against predecessor LSTM based methods, including STA-LSTM, SA-LSTM, CS-LSTM, and NaiveLSTM. Our results, while not outperforming it's predecessor, demonstrate the potential of integrating Transformers with LSTM based technique to build interpretable trajectory prediction model. Future work will explore alternative architectures using Transformer applications to further enhance performance. This study provides a promising direction for improving trajectory prediction models by leveraging transformer based architectures, paving the way for more robust and interpretable vehicle trajectory prediction system.</p></details> |  |

| **[Multi-UAV Collaborative Trajectory Planning for Seamless Data Collection and Transmission](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12494v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted plenty of attention due to their high flexibility and enhanced communication ability. However, the limited coverage and energy of UAVs make it difficult to provide timely wireless service for large-scale sensor networks, which also exist in multiple UAVs. To this end, the advanced collaboration mechanism of UAVs urgently needs to be designed. In this paper, we propose a multi-UAV collaborative scheme for seamless data collection and transmission, where UAVs are dispatched to collection points (CPs) to collect and transmit the time-critical data to the ground base station (BS) simultaneously through the cooperative backhaul link. Specifically, the mission completion time is minimized by optimizing the trajectories, task allocation, collection time scheduling, and transmission topology of UAVs while ensuring backhaul link to the BS. However, the formulated problem is non-convex and challenging to solve directly. To tackle this problem, the CP locations and transmission topology of UAVs are obtained by sensor node (SN) clustering and region division. Next, the transmission connectivity condition between UAVs is derived to facilitate the trajectory discretization and thus reduce the dimensions of variables. This simplifies the problem to optimizing the UAV hovering locations, hovering time, and CP serving sequence. Then, we propose a point-matching-based trajectory planning algorithm to solve the problem efficiently. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves significant performance gains over the two benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, submitted to WCNC Workshop 2025</p></details> |

To build accurate maps, data from mobile 3D LiDAR sensors is often used. Mapping requires correctly aligning the individual point clouds to each other to obtain a globally consistent map. In this paper, we investigate the problem of multi-scan alignment to obtain globally consistent point cloud maps. We propose a 3D LiDAR bundle adjustment approach to solve the global alignment problem and jointly optimize the available data. Utilizing a continuous-time trajectory allows us to consider the ego-motion of the LiDAR scanner while recording a single scan directly in the least squares adjustment. Furthermore, pruning the search space of correspondences and utilizing out-of-core circular buffer enables our approach to align thousands of point clouds efficiently. We successfully align point clouds recorded with a handheld LiDAR, as well as ones mounted on a vehicle, and are able to perform multi-session alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Traditional models often struggle with real-time processing, capturing non-linearity and uncertainty in traffic environments, efficiency in dense traffic, and modeling temporal dynamics of interactions. We introduce NEST (Neuromodulated Small-world Hypergraph Trajectory Prediction), a novel framework that integrates Small-world Networks and hypergraphs for superior interaction modeling and prediction accuracy. This integration enables the capture of both local and extended vehicle interactions, while the Neuromodulator component adapts dynamically to changing traffic conditions. We validate the NEST model on several real-world datasets, including nuScenes, MoCAD, and HighD. The results consistently demonstrate that NEST outperforms existing methods in various traffic scenarios, showcasing its exceptional generalization capability, efficiency, and temporal foresight. Our comprehensive evaluation illustrates that NEST significantly improves the reliability and operational efficiency of autonomous driving systems, making it a robust solution for trajectory prediction in complex traffic environments.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI-25 |

This means that both the filtering and predicted densities for the set of targets are PMBM. In this paper, we first show that the PMBM density is also conjugate for sets of trajectories with the standard point target measurement model. Second, based on this theoretical foundation, we develop two trajectory PMBM filters that provide recursions to calculate the posterior density for the set of all trajectories that have ever been present in the surveillance area, and the posterior density of the set of trajectories present at the current time step in the surveillance area. These two filters therefore provide complete probabilistic information on the considered trajectories enabling optimal trajectory estimation. Third, we establish that the density of the set of trajectories in any time window, given the measurements in a possibly different time window, is also a PMBM. Finally, the trajectory PMBM filters are evaluated via simulations, and are shown to yield state-of-the-art performance compared to other multi-target tracking algorithms based on random finite sets and multiple hypothesis tracking.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted in IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems.

A battery energy storage system (BESS) is commonly used to manage these demand charges. Economic model predictive control (EMPC) with a reference trajectory can be used to dispatch the BESS to optimize the microgrid operating cost. Since demand charges are incurred monthly, EMPC requires a full-month reference trajectory for asymptotic stability guarantees that result in optimal operating costs. However, a full-month reference trajectory is unrealistic from a renewable generation forecast perspective. Therefore, to construct a practical EMPC with a reference trajectory, an EMPC formulation considering both non-coincident demand and on-peak demand charges is designed in this work for 24 to 48 h prediction horizons. The corresponding reference trajectory is computed at each EMPC step by solving an optimal control problem over 24 to 48 h reference (trajectory) horizon. Furthermore, BESS state of charge regulation constraints are incorporated to guarantee the BESS energy level in the long term. Multiple reference and prediction horizon lengths are compared for both shrinking and rolling horizons with real-world data. The proposed EMPC with 48 h rolling reference and prediction horizons outperforms the traditional EMPC benchmark with a 2% reduction in the annual cost, proving its economic benefits.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid</p></details> |

This information is combined with input terrain point clouds or preloaded terrain information to initialize the planning process. We propose the Radiant Field-Informed Coverage Planning algorithm, which utilizes a diffusion field model to dynamically adjust the robot's coverage trajectory and speed based on environmental attributes such as dirtiness and dryness.

This paper presents a Toy-GS method for accurately rendering large-scale free camera trajectories. Specifically, we propose an adaptive spatial division approach for free trajectories to divide cameras and the sparse point cloud of the entire scene into various regions according to camera poses. Training each local Gaussian in parallel for each area enables us to concentrate on texture details and minimize GPU memory usage. Next, we use the multi-view constraint and position-aware point adaptive control (PPAC) to improve the rendering quality of texture details. In addition, our regional fusion approach combines local and global Gaussians to enhance rendering quality with an increasing number of divided areas. Extensive experiments have been carried out to confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of Toy-GS, leading to state-of-the-art results on two public large-scale datasets as well as our SCUTic dataset. Our proposal demonstrates an enhancement of 1.19 dB in PSNR and conserves 7 G of GPU memory when compared to various benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, the development of such agents is hindered by the lack of high-quality, multi-step trajectory data required for effective training. Existing approaches rely on expensive and labor-intensive human annotation, making them unsustainable at scale. To address this challenge, we propose AgentTrek, a scalable data synthesis pipeline that generates high-quality GUI agent trajectories by leveraging web tutorials. Our method automatically gathers tutorial-like texts from the internet, transforms them into task goals with step-by-step instructions, and employs a visual-language model agent to simulate their execution in a real digital environment.

First, the detection network estimates the objects position and orientation in the image space. Furthermore, these are normalized and filtered. The direction and orientation is then the input to the trajectory planner, which considers the kinematic constrains of the used robotic system. This allows safe and stable control, since the kinematic boundary values are taken into account in planning. Also, by having direction estimation and velocity planner separated, the learning part of the method does not directly influence the control value. This also enables the transfer of the method to different robotic systems without retraining, therefore being robot agnostic. We evaluate our method on different visual servoing tasks with and without clutter on two different robotic systems. Our method achieved mean absolute position errors of <0.5 mm and orientation errors of <1{\deg}. Additionally, we transferred the method to a new system which differs in robot and camera, emphasizing robot agnostic capability of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>\copy...</summary><p>\copyright 2024 IEEE.

This paper delves into the development of an innovative Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) framework, specifically tailored for beamforming and trajectory prediction processes. Central to this research is the exploration of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-enabled communication system, which seamlessly integrates ISAC technology. This integration underscores the synergistic interplay between sensing and communication capabilities. The proposed system initially deploys omnidirectional beams for the sensing-focused phase, subsequently transitioning to directional beams for precise object tracking. This process incorporates an Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF) methodology for the accurate estimation and prediction of object states. A novel frame structure is introduced, employing historical sensing data to optimize beamforming in real-time for subsequent time slots, a strategy we refer to as 'temporal-assisted' beamforming. To refine the temporal-assisted beamforming technique, we employ Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) in tandem with Iterative Rank Minimization (IRM), yielding high-quality suboptimal solutions. Comparative analysis with conventional pilot-based systems reveals that our approach yields a substantial improvement of 156\% in multi-object scenarios and 136\% in single-object scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Giving constraints in natural language form has great potential for practical scenarios due to its flexible transfer capability and accessibility. Previous safe RL methods with natural language constraints typically need to design cost functions manually for each constraint, which requires domain expertise and lacks flexibility. In this paper, we harness the dual role of text in this task, using it not only to provide constraint but also as a training signal. We introduce the Trajectory-level Textual Constraints Translator (TTCT) to replace the manually designed cost function. Our empirical results demonstrate that TTCT effectively comprehends textual constraint and trajectory, and the policies trained by TTCT can achieve a lower violation rate than the standard cost function. Extra studies are conducted to demonstrate that the TTCT has zero-shot transfer capability to adapt to constraint-shift environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Towards modeling evolving longitudinal health trajectories with a transformer-based deep learning model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08873v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Health registers contain rich information about individuals' health histories. Here our interest lies in understanding how individuals' health trajectories evolve in a nationwide longitudinal dataset with coded features, such as clinical codes, procedures, and drug purchases. We introduce a straightforward approach for training a Transformer-based deep learning model in a way that lets us analyze how individuals' trajectories change over time. This is achieved by modifying the training objective and by applying a causal attention mask. We focus here on a general task of predicting the onset of a range of common diseases in a given future forecast interval. However, instead of providing a single prediction about diagnoses that could occur in this forecast interval, our approach enable the model to provide continuous predictions at every time point up until, and conditioned on, the time of the forecast period. We find that this model performs comparably to other models, including a bi-directional transformer model, in terms of basic prediction performance while at the same time offering promising trajectory modeling properties. We explore a couple of ways to use this model for analyzing health trajectories and aiding in early detection of events that forecast possible later disease onsets. We hypothesize that this method may be helpful in continuous monitoring of peoples' health trajectories and enabling interventions in ongoing health trajectories, as well as being useful in retrospective analyses.</p></details> |  |

Moving objects trigger events with precise timestamps along their trajectory, enabling smooth continuous-time estimation. However, few works have attempted to optimize the information loss during event representation construction, imposing a ceiling on this task. Fully exploiting event cameras requires representations that simultaneously preserve fine-grained temporal information, stable and characteristic 2D visual features, and temporally consistent information density, an unmet challenge in existing representations. We introduce Labits: Layered Bidirectional Time Surfaces, a simple yet elegant representation designed to retain all these features. Additionally, we propose a dedicated module for extracting active pixel local optical flow (APLOF), significantly boosting the performance. Our approach achieves an impressive 49% reduction in trajectory end-point error (TEPE) compared to the previous state-of-the-art on the MultiFlow dataset. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 12 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

It highlights the collaborative management of four-dimensional flight trajectories, serving as a common reference for decision-making among stakeholders, including Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs), airspace users, and airport operators. Key enabling technologies such as Performance Based Navigation (PBN), data communications, and System-wide Information Management (SWIM) are discussed, showcasing their roles in rapid information exchange and trajectory optimization. A live flight case study demonstrates TBO concepts through international collaboration, indicating significant improvements in safety, efficiency, and sustainability. The paper presents results from TBO prototype implementations, including enhanced trajectory accuracy, improved flight path efficiency, and real-time adjustments based on evolving conditions. The integration of advanced trajectory optimization engines and automation within the FOC has led to more effective flight planning, allowing airlines to negotiate trajectory changes dynamically and optimize operations throughout the flight lifecycle. Findings suggest that TBO can enhance operational predictability, flexibility, and strategic planning while reducing uncertainty and improving alignment between strategic and tactical actions.

| **[Real-Time Trajectory Generation for Soft Robot Manipulators Using Differential Flatness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08568v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soft robots have the potential to interact with sensitive environments and perform complex tasks effectively. However, motion plans and trajectories for soft manipulators are challenging to calculate due to their deformable nature and nonlinear dynamics. This article introduces a fast real-time trajectory generation approach for soft robot manipulators, which creates dynamically-feasible motions for arbitrary kinematically-feasible paths of the robot's end effector. Our insight is that piecewise constant curvature (PCC) dynamics models of soft robots can be differentially flat, therefore control inputs can be calculated algebraically rather than through a nonlinear differential equation. We prove this flatness under certain conditions, with the curvatures of the robot as the flat outputs. Our two-step trajectory generation approach uses an inverse kinematics procedure to calculate a motion plan of robot curvatures per end-effector position, then, our flatness diffeomorphism generates corresponding control inputs that respect velocity. We validate our approach through simulations of our representative soft robot manipulator along three different trajectories, demonstrating a margin of 23x faster than real-time at a frequency of 100 Hz. This approach could allow fast verifiable replanning of soft robots' motions in safety-critical physical environments, crucial for deployment in the real world.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Bi-Level Optimization Approach to Joint Trajectory Optimization for Redundant Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07859v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we present an approach to minimizing the time necessary for the end-effector of a redundant robot manipulator to traverse a Cartesian path by optimizing the trajectory of its joints. Each joint has limits in the ranges of position, velocity and acceleration, the latter making jerks in joint space undesirable. The proposed approach takes this nonlinear optimization problem whose variables are path speed and joint trajectory and reformulates it into a bi-level problem. The lower-level formulation is a convex subproblem that considers a fixed joint trajectory and maximizes path speed while considering all joint velocity and acceleration constraints. Under particular conditions, this subproblem has a closed-form solution. Then, we solve a higher-level subproblem by leveraging the directional derivative of the lower-level value with respect to the joint trajectory parameters. In particular, we use this direction to implement a Primal-Dual method that considers the path accuracy and joint position constraints. We show the efficacy of our proposed approach with simulations and experimental results.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 14 pictures</p></details> |

Previous methods on controllable video generation primarily leverage 2D control signals to manipulate object motions and have achieved remarkable synthesis results. However, 2D control signals are inherently limited in expressing the 3D nature of object motions. To overcome this problem, we introduce 3DTrajMaster, a robust controller that regulates multi-entity dynamics in 3D space, given user-desired 6DoF pose (location and rotation) sequences of entities. At the core of our approach is a plug-and-play 3D-motion grounded object injector that fuses multiple input entities with their respective 3D trajectories through a gated self-attention mechanism. In addition, we exploit an injector architecture to preserve the video diffusion prior, which is crucial for generalization ability. To mitigate video quality degradation, we introduce a domain adaptor during training and employ an annealed sampling strategy during inference. To address the lack of suitable training data, we construct a 360-Motion Dataset, which first correlates collected 3D human and animal assets with GPT-generated trajectory and then captures their motion with 12 evenly-surround cameras on diverse 3D UE platforms. Extensive experiments show that 3DTrajMaster sets a new state-of-the-art in both accuracy and generalization for controlling multi-entity 3D motions.

| **[TraSCE: Trajectory Steering for Concept Erasure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07658v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have brought them to the public spotlight, becoming widely accessible and embraced by everyday users. However, these models have been shown to generate harmful content such as not-safe-for-work (NSFW) images. While approaches have been proposed to erase such abstract concepts from the models, jail-breaking techniques have succeeded in bypassing such safety measures. In this paper, we propose TraSCE, an approach to guide the diffusion trajectory away from generating harmful content. Our approach is based on negative prompting, but as we show in this paper, conventional negative prompting is not a complete solution and can easily be bypassed in some corner cases. To address this issue, we first propose a modification of conventional negative prompting. Furthermore, we introduce a localized loss-based guidance that enhances the modified negative prompting technique by steering the diffusion trajectory. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks in removing harmful content including ones proposed by red teams; and erasing artistic styles and objects. Our proposed approach does not require any training, weight modifications, or training data (both image or prompt), making it easier for model owners to erase new concepts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-finger Manipulation via Trajectory Optimization with Differentiable Rolling and Geometric Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13229v2)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameterizing finger rolling and finger-object contacts in a differentiable manner is important for formulating dexterous manipulation as a trajectory optimization problem. In contrast to previous methods which often assume simplified geometries of the robot and object or do not explicitly model finger rolling, we propose a method to further extend the capabilities of dexterous manipulation by accounting for non-trivial geometries of both the robot and the object. By integrating the object's Signed Distance Field (SDF) with a sampling method, our method estimates contact and rolling-related variables in a differentiable manner and includes those in a trajectory optimization framework. This formulation naturally allows for the emergence of finger-rolling behaviors, enabling the robot to locally adjust the contact points. To evaluate our method, we introduce a benchmark featuring challenging multi-finger dexterous manipulation tasks, such as screwdriver turning and in-hand reorientation. Our method outperforms baselines in terms of achieving desired object configurations and avoiding dropping the object. We also successfully apply our method to a real-world screwdriver turning task and a cuboid alignment task, demonstrating its robustness to the sim2real gap.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this challenge, we extend our previous work on trajectory planning at unsignalized intersections using Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). The method utilizes the Adaptive Belief Tree (ABT) algorithm, an approximate sampling-based approach to solve POMDPs efficiently. We outline the POMDP formulation process, beginning with discretizing the highway topology to reduce problem complexity. Additionally, we describe the dynamics and measurement models used to predict future states and establish the relationship between available noisy measurements and predictions. Building on our previous work, the dynamics model is expanded to account for lateral movements necessary for lane changes during the merging process. We also define the reward function, which serves as the primary mechanism for specifying the desired behavior of the automated vehicle, combining multiple goals such as avoiding collisions or maintaining appropriate velocity. Our simulation results, conducted on three scenarios based on real-life traffic data from German highways, demonstrate the method's ability to generate safe, collision-free, and efficient merging trajectories. This work shows the versatility of this POMDP-based approach in tackling various automated driving problems.</p></details> |  |

Despite its benefits, the efficiency of FL is often restricted by the communication quality between IoT devices and the central server. To address this issue, we introduce an innovative approach by deploying an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a mobile FL server to enhance the training process of FL. By leveraging the UAV's maneuverability, we establish robust line-of-sight connections with IoT devices, significantly improving communication capacity. To improve the overall training efficiency, we formulate a latency minimization problem by jointly optimizing the bandwidth allocation, computing frequencies, transmit power for both the UAV and IoT devices, and the UAV's trajectory. Then, an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is developed to solve it efficiently. Furthermore, we analyze the convergence and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that our proposed scheme not only outperforms existing benchmark schemes in terms of latency but also achieves training efficiency that closely approximate the ideal scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to IEEE</p></details> |

However, before deploying UAVs in the real world, it is essential to ensure they can operate safely in complex environments, especially with limited communication capabilities. To address this challenge, we propose a control-aware learning-based trajectory prediction algorithm that can enable communication-efficient UAV swarm control in a cluttered environment. Specifically, our proposed algorithm can enable each UAV to predict the planned trajectories of its neighbors in scenarios with various levels of communication capabilities. The predicted planned trajectories will serve as input to a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) approach. The proposed algorithm combines (1) a trajectory prediction model based on EvolveGCN, a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) that can handle dynamic graphs, which is further enhanced by compressed messages from adjacent UAVs, and (2) a KKT-informed training approach that applies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions in the training process to encode DMPC information into the trained neural network. We evaluate our proposed algorithm in a funnel-like environment. Results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, providing close-to-optimal control performance and robustness to limited communication capabilities and measurement noises.</p></details> |  |
| **[ITPNet: Towards Instantaneous Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07369v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction of agents is crucial for the safety of autonomous vehicles, whereas previous approaches usually rely on sufficiently long-observed trajectory to predict the future trajectory of the agents. However, in real-world scenarios, it is not realistic to collect adequate observed locations for moving agents, leading to the collapse of most prediction models. For instance, when a moving car suddenly appears and is very close to an autonomous vehicle because of the obstruction, it is quite necessary for the autonomous vehicle to quickly and accurately predict the future trajectories of the car with limited observed trajectory locations. In light of this, we focus on investigating the task of instantaneous trajectory prediction, i.e., two observed locations are available during inference. To this end, we propose a general and plug-and-play instantaneous trajectory prediction approach, called ITPNet. Specifically, we propose a backward forecasting mechanism to reversely predict the latent feature representations of unobserved historical trajectories of the agent based on its two observed locations and then leverage them as complementary information for future trajectory prediction. Meanwhile, due to the inevitable existence of noise and redundancy in the predicted latent feature representations, we further devise a Noise Redundancy Reduction Former, aiming at to filter out noise and redundancy from unobserved trajectories and integrate the filtered features and observed features into a compact query for future trajectory predictions. In essence, ITPNet can be naturally compatible with existing trajectory prediction models, enabling them to gracefully handle the case of instantaneous trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse and nuScenes datasets demonstrate ITPNet outperforms the baselines, and its efficacy with different trajectory prediction models.</p></details> |  |

The trajectory generation exploits the state predictions of the USV to create periodically updated trajectories for a multirotor UAV to precisely land on the deck of a moving USV even in cases where the deck's inclination is continuously changing. We use an MPC-based scheme to create trajectories that consider both the UAV dynamics and the predicted states of the USV up to the first derivative of position and orientation. Compared to existing approaches, our method dynamically modifies the penalization matrices to precisely follow the corresponding states with respect to the flight phase. Especially during the landing maneuver, the UAV synchronizes attitude with the USV's, allowing for fast landing on a tilted deck. Simulations show the method's reliability in various sea conditions up to Rough sea (wave height 4 m), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in landing speed and accuracy, with twice the precision on average. Finally, real-world experiments validate the simulation results, demonstrating robust landings on a moving USV, while all computations are performed in real-time onboard the UAV.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 17 figures, Ocean Engineering</p></details> |

In this work, we investigate a mixed strategy in MF training that first pre-train motion forecasters on pseudo-labeled data, then fine-tune them on annotated data. To obtain pseudo-labeled trajectories, we propose a simple pipeline that leverages off-the-shelf single-frame 3D object detectors and non-learning trackers. The whole pre-training strategy including pseudo-labeling is coined as PPT. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that: (1) combining PPT with supervised fine-tuning on annotated data achieves superior performance on diverse testbeds, especially under annotation-efficient regimes, (2) scaling up to multiple datasets improves the previous state-of-the-art and (3) PPT helps enhance cross-dataset generalization. Our findings showcase PPT as a promising pre-training solution for robust motion forecasting in diverse autonomous driving contexts.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we have employed a method based on the Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) framework designed for planning under uncertainty. The method utilizes the Adaptive Belief Tree (ABT) algorithm as an approximate solver for the POMDPs. We outline the POMDP formulation, beginning with discretizing the intersection's topology. Additionally, we present a dynamics model for the prediction of the evolving states of vehicles, such as their position and velocity. Using an observation model, we also describe the connection of those states with the imperfect (noisy) available measurements. Our results confirmed that the method is able to plan collision-free trajectories in a series of simulations utilizing real-world traffic data from aerial footage of two distinct intersections. Furthermore, we studied the impact of parameter adjustments of the ABT algorithm on the method's performance. This provides guidance in determining reasonable parameter settings, which is valuable for future method applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deterministic Trajectory Optimization through Probabilistic Optimal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13316v3)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we discuss two algorithms tailored to discrete-time deterministic finite-horizon nonlinear optimal control problems or so-called deterministic trajectory optimization problems. Both algorithms can be derived from an emerging theoretical paradigm that we refer to as probabilistic optimal control. The paradigm reformulates stochastic optimal control as an equivalent probabilistic inference problem and can be viewed as a generalisation of the former. The merit of this perspective is that it allows to address the problem using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. It is shown that the application of this algorithm results in a fixed point iteration of probabilistic policies that converge to the deterministic optimal policy. Two strategies for policy evaluation are discussed, using state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods resulting into two distinct algorithms. The algorithms are structurally closest related to the differential dynamic programming algorithm and related methods that use sigma-point methods to avoid direct gradient evaluations. The main advantage of the algorithms is an improved balance between exploration and exploitation over the iterations, leading to improved numerical stability and accelerated convergence. These properties are demonstrated on different nonlinear systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Data Representation for Motion Forecasting: A Scene-Specific Trajectory Set Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20732v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representing diverse and plausible future trajectories is critical for motion forecasting in autonomous driving. However, efficiently capturing these trajectories in a compact set remains challenging. This study introduces a novel approach for generating scene-specific trajectory sets tailored to different contexts, such as intersections and straight roads, by leveraging map information and actor dynamics. A deterministic goal sampling algorithm identifies relevant map regions, while our Recursive In-Distribution Subsampling (RIDS) method enhances trajectory plausibility by condensing redundant representations. Experiments on the Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 10% improvement in Driving Area Compliance (DAC) compared to baseline methods while maintaining competitive displacement errors. Our work highlights the benefits of mining such scene-aware trajectory sets and how they could capture the complex and heterogeneous nature of actor behavior in real-world driving scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Soft Driving Constraints from Vectorized Scene Embeddings while Imitating Expert Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05717v1)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The primary goal of motion planning is to generate safe and efficient trajectories for vehicles. Traditionally, motion planning models are trained using imitation learning to mimic the behavior of human experts. However, these models often lack interpretability and fail to provide clear justifications for their decisions. We propose a method that integrates constraint learning into imitation learning by extracting driving constraints from expert trajectories. Our approach utilizes vectorized scene embeddings that capture critical spatial and temporal features, enabling the model to identify and generalize constraints across various driving scenarios. We formulate the constraint learning problem using a maximum entropy model, which scores the motion planner's trajectories based on their similarity to the expert trajectory. By separating the scoring process into distinct reward and constraint streams, we improve both the interpretability of the planner's behavior and its attention to relevant scene components. Unlike existing constraint learning methods that rely on simulators and are typically embedded in reinforcement learning (RL) or inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) frameworks, our method operates without simulators, making it applicable to a wider range of datasets and real-world scenarios. Experimental results on the InD and TrafficJams datasets demonstrate that incorporating driving constraints enhances model interpretability and improves closed-loop performance.</p></details> |  |

However, this information has not been fully exploited during the inference phase, where the agent needs to generate an optimal policy instead of just reconstructing masked components from unmasked ones. Given that a pretrained trajectory model can act as both a Policy Model and a World Model with appropriate mask patterns, we propose using Model Predictive Control (MPC) at test time to leverage the model's own predictive capability to guide its action selection. Empirical results on D4RL and RoboMimic show that our inference-phase MPC significantly improves the decision-making performance of a pretrained trajectory model without any additional parameter training. Furthermore, our framework can be adapted to Offline to Online (O2O) RL and Goal Reaching RL, resulting in more substantial performance gains when an additional online interaction budget is provided, and better generalization capabilities when different task targets are specified.

In recent years, generative AI models have demonstrated promising results in capturing short and long range dependencies in time series data. While these models have also been applied in healthcare, most of them only predict one value at a time, which is unrealistic in a clinical setting where multiple measures are taken at once. In this work, we extend the framework temporal fusion transformer (TFT), a multi-horizon time series prediction tool, and propose TFT-multi, an end-to-end framework that can predict multiple vital trajectories simultaneously. We apply TFT-multi to forecast 5 vital signs recorded in the intensive care unit: blood pressure, pulse, SpO2, temperature and respiratory rate. We hypothesize that by jointly predicting these measures, which are often correlated with one another, we can make more accurate predictions, especially in variables with large missingness. We validate our model on the public MIMIC dataset and an independent institutional dataset, and demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art univariate prediction tools including the original TFT and Prophet, as well as vector regression modeling for multivariate prediction. Furthermore, we perform a study case analysis by applying our pipeline to forecast blood pressure changes in response to actual and hypothetical pressor administration.</p></details> |  |

However, they face challenges due to their high-dimensional and unstable dynamics, as well as the complex contact-rich nature of the tasks. Model-based optimal control methods offer precise and systematic control but are limited by high computational complexity and accurate contact sensing. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) provides robustness and handles high-dimensional spaces but suffers from inefficient learning, unnatural motion, and sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Opt2Skill, an end-to-end pipeline that combines model-based trajectory optimization with RL to achieve robust whole-body loco-manipulation. We generate reference motions for the Digit humanoid robot using differential dynamic programming (DDP) and train RL policies to track these trajectories. Our results demonstrate that Opt2Skill outperforms pure RL methods in both training efficiency and task performance, with optimal trajectories that account for torque limits enhancing trajectory tracking. We successfully transfer our approach to real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Accurate forecasting requires a comprehensive understanding not only of each pedestrian's previous trajectory but also of their interaction with the surrounding environment, an important part of which are other pedestrians moving dynamically in the scene. To learn effective socially-informed representations, we propose a model that uses a reconstructor alongside a conditional variational autoencoder-based trajectory forecasting module. This module generates pseudo-trajectories, which we use as augmentations throughout the training process. To further guide the model towards social awareness, we propose a novel social loss that aids in forecasting of more stable trajectories.

We demonstrate through extensive experiments that S2L significantly improves data efficiency in SFT for mathematical problem-solving, reducing the training data to just 11% of the original MathInstruct dataset (Yue et al., 2023) to match full dataset performance while outperforming state-of-the-art data selection algorithms by an average of 4.7% across 6 in- and out-domain evaluation datasets. Remarkably, selecting only 50K data for SFT, S2L achieves a 32.7% accuracy on the most challenging MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) benchmark, improving Phi-2 (Li et al., 2023b) by 16.6%. In clinical text summarization on the MIMIC-III dataset (Johnson et al., 2016), S2L again outperforms training on the full dataset using only 50% of the data. Notably, S2L can perform data selection using a reference model 40x smaller than the target model, proportionally reducing the cost of data selection.</p></details> |  |

| **[Distributed Mixture-of-Agents for Edge Inference with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21200v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) has recently been proposed as a method to enhance performance of large language models (LLMs), enabling multiple individual LLMs to work together for collaborative inference. This collaborative approach results in improved responses to user prompts compared to relying on a single LLM. In this paper, we consider such an MoA architecture in a distributed setting, where LLMs operate on individual edge devices, each uniquely associated with a user and equipped with its own distributed computing power. These devices exchange information using decentralized gossip algorithms, allowing different device nodes to talk without the supervision of a centralized server. In the considered setup, different users have their own LLM models to address user prompts. Additionally, the devices gossip either their own user-specific prompts or augmented prompts to generate more refined answers to certain queries. User prompts are temporarily stored in the device queues when their corresponding LLMs are busy. Given the memory limitations of edge devices, it is crucial to ensure that the average queue sizes in the system remain bounded. In this paper, we address this by theoretically calculating the queuing stability conditions for the device queues under reasonable assumptions, which we validate experimentally as well. Further, we demonstrate through experiments, leveraging open-source LLMs for the implementation of distributed MoA, that certain MoA configurations produce higher-quality responses compared to others, as evaluated on AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark. The implementation is available at: https://github.com/purbeshmitra/distributed_moa.</p></details> |  |

Unlike images, videos possess an additional temporal dimension, which harbors considerable redundant information, making condensation even more crucial. However, video dataset condensation still remains an underexplored area. We aim to bridge this gap by providing a large-scale empirical study with systematic design and fair comparison. Specifically, our work delves into three key aspects to provide valuable empirical insights: (1) temporal processing of video data, (2) establishing a comprehensive evaluation protocol for video dataset condensation, and (3) adaptation of condensation methods to the space-time domain and fair comparisons among them. From this study, we derive several intriguing observations: (i) sample diversity appears to be more crucial than temporal diversity for video dataset condensation, (ii) simple slide-window sampling proves to be effective, and (iii) sample selection currently outperforms dataset distillation in most cases. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on three prominent action recognition datasets (HMDB51, UCF101 and Kinetics-400) and achieve state-of-the-art results on all of them. Our code is available at https://github.com/MCG-NJU/Video-DC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Order Matters in Hallucination: Reasoning Order as Benchmark and Reflexive Prompting for Large-Language-Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05093v3)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have generated significant attention since their inception, finding applications across various academic and industrial domains. However, these models often suffer from the "hallucination problem", where outputs, though grammatically and logically coherent, lack factual accuracy or are entirely fabricated. A particularly troubling issue discovered and widely discussed recently is the numerical comparison error where multiple LLMs incorrectly infer that "9.11$>$9.9". We discovered that the order in which LLMs generate answers and reasoning impacts their consistency. Specifically, results vary significantly when an LLM generates an answer first and then provides the reasoning versus generating the reasoning process first and then the conclusion. Inspired by this, we propose a new benchmark method for assessing LLM consistency: comparing responses generated through these two different approaches. This benchmark effectively identifies instances where LLMs fabricate answers and subsequently generate justifications. Furthermore, we introduce a novel and straightforward prompt strategy designed to mitigate this issue. Experimental results demonstrate that this strategy improves performance across various LLMs compared to direct questioning. This work not only sheds light on a critical flaw in LLMs but also offers a practical solution to enhance their reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, submitted to ACL22025</p></details> |
| **[Facilitating large language model Russian adaptation with Learned Embedding Propagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21140v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid advancements of large language model (LLM) technologies led to the introduction of powerful open-source instruction-tuned LLMs that have the same text generation quality as the state-of-the-art counterparts such as GPT-4. While the emergence of such models accelerates the adoption of LLM technologies in sensitive-information environments the authors of such models don not disclose the training data necessary for replication of the results thus making the achievements model-exclusive. Since those open-source models are also multilingual this in turn reduces the benefits of training a language specific LLMs as improved inference computation efficiency becomes the only guaranteed advantage of such costly procedure. More cost-efficient options such as vocabulary extension and subsequent continued pre-training are also inhibited by the lack of access to high-quality instruction-tuning data since it is the major factor behind the resulting LLM task-solving capabilities. To address the limitations and cut the costs of the language adaptation pipeline we propose Learned Embedding Propagation (LEP). Unlike existing approaches our method has lower training data size requirements due to minimal impact on existing LLM knowledge which we reinforce using novel ad-hoc embedding propagation procedure that allows to skip the instruction-tuning step and instead implant the new language knowledge directly into any existing instruct-tuned variant. We evaluated four Russian vocabulary adaptations for LLaMa-3-8B and Mistral-7B, showing that LEP is competitive with traditional instruction-tuning methods, achieving performance comparable to OpenChat 3.5 and LLaMa-3-8B-Instruct, with further improvements via self-calibration and continued tuning enhancing task-solving capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint version of an article published in the Journal of Language and Education.

The intricate interplay between quasiparticles and emergent order-parameter fields could lead to unusual coarsening dynamics that is beyond the standard theories. However, accurate treatment of both quasiparticles and collective degrees of freedom is a multi-scale challenge in dynamical simulations of correlated electrons. Here we leverage modern machine learning (ML) methods to achieve a linear-scaling algorithm for simulating the coarsening of charge density waves (CDWs), one of the fundamental symmetry breaking phases in functional electron materials. We demonstrate our approach on the square-lattice Hubbard-Holstein model and uncover an intriguing enhancement of CDW coarsening which is related to the screening of on-site potential by electron-electron interactions. Our study provides fresh insights into the role of electron correlations in non-equilibrium dynamics and underscores the promise of ML force-field approaches for advancing multi-scale dynamical modeling of correlated electron systems.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

However, the diversity and complexity of different components pose a significant challenge to cloud security, especially when dealing with sophisticated and advanced cyberattacks. Recent advancements in generative foundation models (GFMs), particularly in the large language models (LLMs), offer promising solutions for security intelligence. By exploiting the powerful abilities in language understanding, data analysis, task inference, action planning, and code generation, we present LLM-PD, a novel proactive defense architecture that defeats various threats in a proactive manner. LLM-PD can efficiently make a decision through comprehensive data analysis and sequential reasoning, as well as dynamically creating and deploying actionable defense mechanisms on the target cloud. Furthermore, it can flexibly self-evolve based on experience learned from previous interactions and adapt to new attack scenarios without additional training. The experimental results demonstrate its remarkable ability in terms of defense effectiveness and efficiency, particularly highlighting an outstanding success rate when compared with other existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages; In submission</p></details> |

While existing benchmarks evaluate these models in context-rich, real-life scenarios, they often overlook fundamental perceptual skills essential for environments deviating from everyday realism. In particular, geometric perception, the ability to interpret spatial relationships and abstract visual patterns, remains underexplored. To address this limitation, we introduce GePBench, a novel benchmark designed to assess the geometric perception capabilities of MLLMs. Results from extensive evaluations reveal that current state-of-the-art MLLMs exhibit significant deficiencies in such tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate that models trained with data sourced from GePBench show notable improvements on a wide range of downstream tasks, underscoring the importance of geometric perception as a foundation for advanced multimodal applications. Our code and datasets will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeIP: A Grammar-Guided Multi-Bit Watermark for Large Language Models of Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15639v3)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code generation. It now becomes crucial to identify whether the code is AI-generated and to determine the specific model used, particularly for purposes such as protecting Intellectual Property (IP) in industry and preventing cheating in programming exercises. To this end, several attempts have been made to insert watermarks into machine-generated code. However, existing approaches are limited to inserting only a single bit of information. In this paper, we introduce CodeIP, a novel multi-bit watermarking technique that inserts additional information to preserve crucial provenance details, such as the vendor ID of an LLM, thereby safeguarding the IPs of LLMs in code generation. Furthermore, to ensure the syntactical correctness of the generated code, we propose constraining the sampling process for predicting the next token by training a type predictor. Experiments conducted on a real-world dataset across five programming languages demonstrate the effectiveness of CodeIP in watermarking LLMs for code generation while maintaining the syntactical correctness of code.</p></details> | 16 pages, 13 figures |

| **[KARPA: A Training-free Method of Adapting Knowledge Graph as References for Large Language Model's Reasoning Path Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20995v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance across a variety of tasks, yet they are often affected by hallucinations and the timeliness of knowledge. Leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs) as external knowledge sources has emerged as a viable solution, but existing methods for LLM-based knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) are often limited by step-by-step decision-making on KGs, restricting the global planning and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, or they require fine-tuning or pre-training on specific KGs. To address these challenges, we propose Knowledge graph Assisted Reasoning Path Aggregation (KARPA), a novel framework that harnesses the global planning abilities of LLMs for efficient and accurate KG reasoning. KARPA operates in three steps: pre-planning relation paths using the LLM's global planning capabilities, matching semantically relevant paths via an embedding model, and reasoning over these paths to generate answers. Unlike existing KGQA methods, KARPA avoids stepwise traversal, requires no additional training, and is adaptable to various LLM architectures. Extensive experimental results show that KARPA achieves state-of-the-art performance in KGQA tasks, delivering both high efficiency and accuracy. Our code will be available on Github.</p></details> | 23 pages, 6 figures |

However, their substantial sizes pose considerable challenges, particularly in computational demands and inference speed, due to their quadratic complexity. In this work, we have identified a key pattern: certain seemingly meaningless special tokens (i.e., separators) contribute disproportionately to attention scores compared to semantically meaningful tokens. This observation suggests that information of the segments between these separator tokens can be effectively condensed into the separator tokens themselves without significant information loss. Guided by this insight, we introduce SepLLM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates inference by compressing these segments and eliminating redundant tokens. Additionally, we implement efficient kernels for training acceleration. Experimental results across training-free, training-from-scratch, and post-training settings demonstrate SepLLM's effectiveness. Notably, using the Llama-3-8B backbone, SepLLM achieves over 50% reduction in KV cache on the GSM8K-CoT benchmark while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, in streaming settings, SepLLM effectively processes sequences of up to 4 million tokens or more while maintaining consistent language modeling capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have made our code publicly available at sepllm.github.io.

| **[MMEvol: Empowering Multimodal Large Language Models with Evol-Instruct](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05840v4)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has seen significant advancements with increasing demands in various fields (e.g., multimodal agents, embodied intelligence). While model-driven approaches attempt to enhance MLLMs capabilities through diverse architectures, the gains have become increasingly marginal. Conversely, data-driven methods, which scale up image-text instruction data, are more effective but face limited data diversity and complexity challenges. The absence of high-quality data constitutes a significant development barrier for MLLMs. To address the data quality bottleneck, we propose MMEvol, a novel multimodal instruction data evolution framework. This framework iteratively improve data quality through a refined combination of fine-grained perception, cognitive reasoning, and interaction evolution, generating a more complex and diverse image-text instruction dataset that empowers MLLMs with enhanced capabilities. Beginning with an initial set of instructions, SEED-163K, we utilize MMEvol to systematically broaden the diversity of instruction types, extend visual reasoning steps to improve cognitive reasoning abilities, and thoroughly explore fine-grained information within images to enhance visual understanding and robustness. To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive qualitative analysis and quantitative experiments across 13 vision-language tasks. Compared to baseline models trained with the initial seed data, the results demonstrate that our method achieves an average accuracy improvement of 3.1 percentage points. Furthermore, our approach reaches state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in nine tasks using significantly less data compared to state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Study of Catastrophic Forgetting in Large Language Models During Continual Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08747v4)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Catastrophic forgetting (CF) is a phenomenon that occurs in machine learning when a model forgets previously learned information while acquiring new knowledge for achieving a satisfactory performance in downstream tasks. As large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance, it is intriguing to investigate whether CF exists during the continual instruction tuning of LLMs. This study empirically evaluates the forgetting phenomenon in LLMs' knowledge during continual instruction tuning from the perspectives of domain knowledge, reasoning, and reading comprehension. The experiments reveal that catastrophic forgetting is generally observed in LLMs ranging from 1b to 7b parameters. Surprisingly, as the model scale increases, the severity of forgetting intensifies in such a model sale range which may result from the much significant initial performance in the larger LLM. Comparing the decoder-only model BLOOMZ with the encoder-decoder model mT0, BLOOMZ exhibits less forgetting and retains more knowledge. Interestingly, we also observe that LLMs can mitigate language biases, such as gender bias, during continual fine-tuning. Furthermore, our findings indicate that general instruction tuning can help alleviate the forgetting phenomenon in LLMs during subsequent fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[DoTA: Weight-Decomposed Tensor Adaptation for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20891v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) reduces the computational and memory demands of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) by approximating updates with low-rank matrices. However, low-rank approximation in two-dimensional space fails to capture high-dimensional structures within the target matrix. Recently, tensor decomposition methods have been explored for fine-tuning LLMs, leveraging their ability to extract structured information. Yet, these approaches primarily rely on random initialization, and the impact of initialization on tensor adaptation remains underexplored. In this paper, we reveal that random initialization significantly diverges from the validation loss achieved by full fine-tuning. To address this, we propose Weight-Decomposed Tensor Adaptation (DoTA), which leverages the Matrix Product Operator (MPO) decomposition of pre-trained weights for effective initialization in fine-tuning LLMs. Additionally, we introduce QDoTA, a quantized version of DoTA designed for 4-bit quantization. Experiments on commonsense and arithmetic reasoning tasks show that DoTA outperforms random initialization methods with fewer parameters. QDoTA further reduces memory consumption and achieves comparable performance to DoTA on commonsense reasoning tasks. We will release our code to support future research.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

Recent studies demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) possess exceptional sentiment understanding capabilities. However, directly deploying LLMs for FSA applications incurs high inference costs. Therefore, this paper investigates the distillation of fine-grained sentiment understanding from LLMs into small language models (SLMs). We prompt LLMs to examine and interpret the sentiments of given reviews and then utilize the generated content to pretrain SLMs. Additionally, we develop a comprehensive FSA benchmark to evaluate both SLMs and LLMs. Extensive experiments on this benchmark reveal that: (1) distillation significantly enhances the performance of SLMs in FSA tasks, achieving a 6.00\% improvement in $F_1$-score, and the distilled model can outperform Llama-2-7b with only 220M parameters; (2) distillation equips SLMs with excellent zero-shot sentiment classification capabilities, enabling them to match or even exceed their teacher models. These results suggest that distillation from LLMs is a highly promising direction for FSA. We will release our code, data, and pretrained model weights at https://github.com/HITSZ-HLT/FSA-Distillation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Capability in Token Space: An Analysis of Large Vision Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18387v2)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scaling capability has been widely validated in neural language models with respect to the number of parameters and the size of training data. One important question is that does the scaling capability also exists similarly with respect to the number of vision tokens in large vision language Model? This study fills the gap by investigating the relationship between the number of vision tokens and the performance on vision-language models. Our theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations demonstrate that the model exhibits scalable performance \(S(N_l)\) with respect to the number of vision tokens \(N_l\), characterized by the relationship \(S(N_l) \approx (c/N_l)^{\alpha}\). Furthermore, we also investigate the impact of a fusion mechanism that integrates the user's question with vision tokens. The results reveal two key findings. First, the scaling capability remains intact with the incorporation of the fusion mechanism. Second, the fusion mechanism enhances model performance, particularly when the user's question is task-specific and relevant. The analysis, conducted on fifteen diverse benchmarks spanning a broad range of tasks and domains, validates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

Considering the constrained power consumption of these devices, the large differential delay and Doppler shift are handled at the satellite receiver. We firstly propose a spreading-based multi-frame transmission scheme with orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation to mitigate the doubly dispersive effect in time and frequency, and then analyze the input-output relationship of the system. Next, we propose a receiver structure based on three modules: a linear module for identifying active devices that leverages the generalized approximate message passing algorithm to eliminate inter-user and inter-carrier interference; a non-linear module that employs the message passing algorithm to jointly estimate the channel and detect the transmitted symbols; and a third module that aims to exploit the three dimensional block channel sparsity in the delay-Doppler-angle domain. Soft information is exchanged among the three modules by careful message scheduling. Furthermore, the expectation-maximization algorithm is integrated to adjust phase rotation caused by the fractional Doppler and to learn the hyperparameters in the priors. Finally, the convolutional neural network is incorporated to enhance the symbol detection. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed transmission scheme boosts the system performance, and the designed algorithms outperform the conventional methods significantly in terms of the device identification, channel estimation, and symbol detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by the IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications</p></details> |
| **[DELA: A Novel Approach for Detecting Errors Induced by Large Atomic Condition Numbers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20804v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerical programs form the foundation of modern science and engineering, providing essential solutions to complex mathematical problems. Therefore, errors in numerical results would lead to harmful consequences, especially in safety-critical applications. Since only a few inputs may lead to substantial errors for numerical programs, it is essential to determine whether a given input could result in a significant error. Existing researchers tend to use the results of high-precision programs to assess whether there is a substantial error, which introduces three main challenges: difficulty of implementation, existence of potential faults in the detection of numerical errors, and long execution time. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named DELA. Our approach is based on the observation that most numerical errors stem from large condition numbers in atomic operations (such as subtraction), which then propagate and accumulate. DELA injects small perturbations into the results of individual atomic operations within the program and compares the outcomes of the original program with the perturbed version to detect errors. We evaluate DELA with datasets from ATOMU and HSED, as well as data from a complex linear system-solving program. Experimental results demonstrate that we can detect all the significant errors that were reported by prior research. DELA shows strong alignment with high-precision programs of ATOMU and HSED, with average Pearson and Spearman correlations of 0.86 and 0.61. Additionally, DELA effectively detects significant errors in complex programs, achieving correlation scores of 0.9763 and 0.8993. More importantly, in experiments with ATOMU and HSED, DELA's perturbed programs run within only 0.13% of the time needed by high-precision versions; while for the linear system-solving programs, DELA is 73.46 times faster than the high-precision programs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model Enabled Multi-Task Physical Layer Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20772v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is continuously reshaping the future 6G wireless communications. Recently, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a promising approach to effectively improve the performance and generalization for different physical layer tasks. However, most existing works finetune dedicated LLM networks for a single wireless communication task separately. Thus performing diverse physical layer tasks introduces extremely high training resources, memory usage, and deployment costs. To solve the problem, we propose a LLM-enabled multi-task physical layer network to unify multiple tasks with a single LLM. Specifically, we first propose a multi-task LLM framework, which finetunes LLM to perform multi-user precoding, signal detection and channel prediction simultaneously. Besides, multi-task instruction module, input encoders, as well as output decoders, are elaborately designed to distinguish multiple tasks and adapted the features of different formats of wireless data for the features of LLM. Numerical simulations are also displayed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models for Classical Chinese Poetry Translation: Benchmarking, Evaluating, and Improving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09945v4)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Different from the traditional translation tasks, classical Chinese poetry translation requires both adequacy and fluency in translating culturally and historically significant content and linguistic poetic elegance. Large language models (LLMs) with impressive multilingual capabilities may bring a ray of hope to achieve this extreme translation demand. This paper first introduces a suitable benchmark (PoetMT) where each Chinese poetry has a recognized elegant translation. Meanwhile, we propose a new metric based on GPT-4 to evaluate the extent to which current LLMs can meet these demands. Our empirical evaluation reveals that the existing LLMs fall short in the challenging task. Hence, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Machine Translation (RAT) method which incorporates knowledge related to classical poetry for advancing the translation of Chinese Poetry in LLMs. Experimental results show that RAT consistently outperforms all comparison methods regarding wildly used BLEU, COMET, BLEURT, our proposed metric, and human evaluation.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Zero-Indexing Internet Search Augmented Generation for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19478v2)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval augmented generation has emerged as an effective method to enhance large language model performance. This approach typically relies on an internal retrieval module that uses various indexing mechanisms to manage a static pre-processed corpus. However, such a paradigm often falls short when it is necessary to integrate the most up-to-date information that has not been updated into the corpus during generative inference time. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that leverages standard search engine APIs to dynamically integrate the latest online information (without maintaining any index for any fixed corpus), thereby improving the quality of generated content. We design a collaborative LLM-based paradigm, where we include: (i) a parser-LLM that determines if the Internet augmented generation is demanded and extracts the search keywords if so with a single inference; (ii) a mixed ranking strategy that re-ranks the retrieved HTML files to eliminate bias introduced from the search engine API; and (iii) an extractor-LLM that can accurately and efficiently extract relevant information from the fresh content in each HTML file. We conduct extensive empirical studies to evaluate the performance of this Internet search augmented generation paradigm. The experimental results demonstrate that our method generates content with significantly improved quality. Our system has been successfully deployed in a production environment to serve 01.AI's generative inference requests.</p></details> |  |

The advent of LLMs, particularly multimodal models, has ushered in a new era of GUI automation. They have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in natural language understanding, code generation, and visual processing. This has paved the way for a new generation of LLM-brained GUI agents capable of interpreting complex GUI elements and autonomously executing actions based on natural language instructions. These agents represent a paradigm shift, enabling users to perform intricate, multi-step tasks through simple conversational commands. Their applications span across web navigation, mobile app interactions, and desktop automation, offering a transformative user experience that revolutionizes how individuals interact with software. This emerging field is rapidly advancing, with significant progress in both research and industry. To provide a structured understanding of this trend, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of LLM-brained GUI agents, exploring their historical evolution, core components, and advanced techniques. We address research questions such as existing GUI agent frameworks, the collection and utilization of data for training specialized GUI agents, the development of large action models tailored for GUI tasks, and the evaluation metrics and benchmarks necessary to assess their effectiveness.

| **[ChartAdapter: Large Vision-Language Model for Chart Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20715v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chart summarization, which focuses on extracting key information from charts and interpreting it in natural language, is crucial for generating and delivering insights through effective and accessible data analysis. Traditional methods for chart understanding and summarization often rely on multi-stage pipelines, which may produce suboptimal semantic alignment between visual and textual information. In comparison, recently developed LLM-based methods are more dependent on the capability of foundation images or languages, while ignoring the characteristics of chart data and its relevant challenges. To address these limitations, we propose ChartAdapter, a novel lightweight transformer module designed to bridge the gap between charts and textual summaries. ChartAdapter employs learnable query vectors to extract implicit semantics from chart data and incorporates a cross-modal alignment projector to enhance vision-to-language generative learning. By integrating ChartAdapter with an LLM, we enable end-to-end training and efficient chart summarization. To further enhance the training, we introduce a three-stage hierarchical training procedure and develop a large-scale dataset specifically curated for chart summarization, comprising 190,618 samples. Experimental results on the standard Chart-to-Text testing set demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, including state-of-the-art models, in generating high-quality chart summaries. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of key components in ChartAdapter. This work highlights the potential of tailored LLM-based approaches to advance chart understanding and sets a strong foundation for future research in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[SelectLLM: Query-Aware Efficient Selection Algorithm for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08545v2)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have seen widespread adoption due to their remarkable performance across various applications, driving the accelerated development of a large number of diverse LLMs. However, these individual LLMs show limitations in generalization and performance on complex tasks due to inherent training biases, model size constraints, and the quality or diversity of pre-training datasets. A promising direction is to efficiently harness the diverse capabilities of LLMs to overcome these individual limitations. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel LLM selection algorithm called SelectLLM, which efficiently directs input queries to the most suitable subset of LLMs from a large pool, ensuring that the selected models collectively provide accurate responses. SelectLLM employs a multi-label classifier and policy based on the classifier's predictions and confidence scores in selecting an optimal, query-aware, and lightweight subset of LLMs. Our findings indicate that the proposed model outperforms existing ensemble-based baselines and achieves competitive performance with similarly sized top-performing LLMs while maintaining efficiency. Specifically, it achieves a huge reduction in inference latency on two challenging reasoning benchmarks: 13% on GSM8K and 70% on MMLU, compared to the top-performing baselines. Also, we establish a theoretical upper bound by an oracle with LLMs and explore in-depth linguistic analysis to understand the performance gap between Oracle and SelectLLM.</p></details> |  |

| **[Memorization Over Reasoning? Exposing and Mitigating Verbatim Memorization in Large Language Models' Character Understanding Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14368v3)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in character understanding tasks, such as analyzing the roles, personalities, and relationships of fictional characters. However, the extensive pre-training corpora used by LLMs raise concerns that they may rely on memorizing popular fictional works rather than genuinely understanding and reasoning about them. In this work, we argue that 'gist memory'-capturing essential meaning - should be the primary mechanism for character understanding tasks, as opposed to 'verbatim memory' - exact match of a string. We introduce a simple yet effective method to mitigate mechanized memorization in character understanding evaluations while preserving the essential implicit cues needed for comprehension and reasoning. Our approach reduces memorization-driven performance on popular fictional works from 96% accuracy to 72% and results in up to an 18% drop in accuracy across various character understanding tasks. These findings underscore the issue of data contamination in existing benchmarks, which often measure memorization rather than true character understanding.</p></details> |  |

While recent work like FunSearch has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged for heuristic design in evolutionary algorithm (EA) frameworks, their potential is not fully realized due to its deficiency in exploitation and exploration. We present UBER (Uncertainty-Based Evolution for Refinement), a method that enhances LLM+EA methods for automatic heuristic design by integrating uncertainty on top of the FunSearch framework. UBER introduces two key innovations: an Uncertainty-Inclusive Evolution Process (UIEP) for adaptive exploration-exploitation balance, and a principled Uncertainty-Inclusive Island Reset (UIIS) strategy for maintaining population diversity. Through extensive experiments on challenging NP-complete problems, UBER demonstrates significant improvements over FunSearch. Our work provides a new direction for the synergy of LLMs and EA, advancing the field of automatic heuristic design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large-scale moral machine experiment on large language models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06790v2)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their potential integration into autonomous driving systems necessitates understanding their moral decision-making capabilities. While our previous study examined four prominent LLMs using the Moral Machine experimental framework, the dynamic landscape of LLM development demands a more comprehensive analysis. Here, we evaluate moral judgments across 52 different LLMs, including multiple versions of proprietary models (GPT, Claude, Gemini) and open-source alternatives (Llama, Gemma), to assess their alignment with human moral preferences in autonomous driving scenarios. Using a conjoint analysis framework, we evaluated how closely LLM responses aligned with human preferences in ethical dilemmas and examined the effects of model size, updates, and architecture. Results showed that proprietary models and open-source models exceeding 10 billion parameters demonstrated relatively close alignment with human judgments, with a significant negative correlation between model size and distance from human judgments in open-source models. However, model updates did not consistently improve alignment with human preferences, and many LLMs showed excessive emphasis on specific ethical principles. These findings suggest that while increasing model size may naturally lead to more human-like moral judgments, practical implementation in autonomous driving systems requires careful consideration of the trade-off between judgment quality and computational efficiency. Our comprehensive analysis provides crucial insights for the ethical design of autonomous systems and highlights the importance of considering cultural contexts in AI moral decision-making.</p></details> | 21 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Exploring Concept Depth: How Large Language Models Acquire Knowledge at Different Layers?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07066v6)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performances across a wide range of tasks. However, the mechanisms by which these models encode tasks of varying complexities remain poorly understood. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that LLMs process concepts of varying complexities in different layers, introducing the idea of ``Concept Depth'' to suggest that more complex concepts are typically acquired in deeper layers. Specifically, we categorize concepts based on their level of abstraction, defining them in the order of increasing complexity within factual, emotional, and inferential tasks. We conduct extensive probing experiments using layer-wise representations across various LLM families (Gemma, LLaMA, Qwen) on various datasets spanning the three domains of tasks. Our findings reveal that models could efficiently conduct probing for simpler tasks in shallow layers, and more complex tasks typically necessitate deeper layers for accurate understanding. Additionally, we examine how external factors, such as adding noise to the input and quantizing the model weights, might affect layer-wise representations. Our findings suggest that these factors can impede the development of a conceptual understanding of LLMs until deeper layers are explored. We hope that our proposed concept and experimental insights will enhance the understanding of the mechanisms underlying LLMs. Our codes are available at \url{https://github.com/Luckfort/CD}.</p></details> | COLING 2025 |

Legislative frameworks such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) have necessitated the development of strategies that preserve privacy while maintaining the utility of data. In this paper, we investigate the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic datasets integrated with Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms, thereby enabling data-driven research and model training without direct exposure of sensitive information. Our approach incorporates DP-based noise injection methods, including Laplace and Gaussian distributions, into the data generation process. We then evaluate the utility of these DP-enhanced synthetic datasets by comparing the performance of ML models trained on them against models trained on the original data. To substantiate privacy guarantees, we assess the resilience of the generated synthetic data to membership inference attacks and related threats. The experimental results demonstrate that integrating DP within LLM-driven synthetic data generation offers a viable balance between privacy protection and data utility. This study provides a foundational methodology and insight into the privacy-preserving capabilities of LLMs, paving the way for compliant and effective ML research and applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 1 figure, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge Editing for Large Language Model with Knowledge Neuronal Ensemble](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20637v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As real-world knowledge is constantly evolving, ensuring the timeliness and accuracy of a model's knowledge is crucial. This has made knowledge editing in large language models increasingly important. However, existing knowledge editing methods face several challenges, including parameter localization coupling, imprecise localization, and a lack of dynamic interaction across layers. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge editing method called Knowledge Neuronal Ensemble (KNE). A knowledge neuronal ensemble represents a group of neurons encoding specific knowledge, thus mitigating the issue of frequent parameter modification caused by coupling in parameter localization. The KNE method enhances the precision and accuracy of parameter localization by computing gradient attribution scores for each parameter at each layer. During the editing process, only the gradients and losses associated with the knowledge neuronal ensemble are computed, with error backpropagation performed accordingly, ensuring dynamic interaction and collaborative updates among parameters. Experimental results on three widely used knowledge editing datasets show that the KNE method significantly improves the accuracy of knowledge editing and achieves, or even exceeds, the performance of the best baseline methods in portability and locality metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models-guided Dynamic Adaptation for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14170v3)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning (TKGR) is the process of utilizing temporal information to capture complex relations within a Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) to infer new knowledge. Conventional methods in TKGR typically depend on deep learning algorithms or temporal logical rules. However, deep learning-based TKGRs often lack interpretability, whereas rule-based TKGRs struggle to effectively learn temporal rules that capture temporal patterns. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated extensive knowledge and remarkable proficiency in temporal reasoning. Consequently, the employment of LLMs for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning (TKGR) has sparked increasing interest among researchers. Nonetheless, LLMs are known to function as black boxes, making it challenging to comprehend their reasoning process. Additionally, due to the resource-intensive nature of fine-tuning, promptly updating LLMs to integrate evolving knowledge within TKGs for reasoning is impractical. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Large Language Models-guided Dynamic Adaptation (LLM-DA) method for reasoning on TKGs. Specifically, LLM-DA harnesses the capabilities of LLMs to analyze historical data and extract temporal logical rules. These rules unveil temporal patterns and facilitate interpretable reasoning. To account for the evolving nature of TKGs, a dynamic adaptation strategy is proposed to update the LLM-generated rules with the latest events. This ensures that the extracted rules always incorporate the most recent knowledge and better generalize to the predictions on future events. Experimental results show that without the need of fine-tuning, LLM-DA significantly improves the accuracy of reasoning over several common datasets, providing a robust framework for TKGR tasks.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in benefiting researchers across various fields. To explore their potential for interdisciplinary collaboration, we collect and analyze data from OpenAlex, an open-source academic database. Our dataset comprises 59,293 LLM-related papers, along with 70,945 machine learning (ML) papers and 73,110 papers from non-LLM/ML fields as control groups. We first employ Shannon Entropy to assess the diversity of collaboration. Our results reveal that many fields have exhibited a more significant increasing trend following the release of ChatGPT as compared to the control groups. In particular, Computer Science and Social Science display a consistent increase in both institution and department entropy. Other fields such as Decision Science, Psychology, and Health Professions have shown minor to significant increases. Our difference-in-difference analysis also indicates that the release of ChatGPT leads to a statistically significant increase in collaboration in several fields, such as Computer Science and Social Science. In addition, we analyze the author networks and find that Computer Science, Medicine, and other Computer Science-related departments are the most prominent. Regarding authors' institutions, our analysis reveals that entities such as Stanford University, Harvard University, and University College London are key players, either dominating centrality or playing crucial roles in connecting research networks. Overall, this study provides valuable information on the current landscape and evolving dynamics of collaboration networks in LLM research. It also suggests potential areas for fostering more diverse collaborations and highlights the need for continued research on the impact of LLMs on scientific practices.</p></details> |  |

However, they are still plagued by object hallucination: the misidentification or misclassification of objects present in images. To this end, we propose HALLUCINOGEN, a novel visual question answering (VQA) object hallucination attack benchmark that utilizes diverse contextual reasoning prompts to evaluate object hallucination in state-of-the-art LVLMs. We design a series of contextual reasoning hallucination prompts to evaluate LVLMs' ability to accurately identify objects in a target image while asking them to perform diverse visual-language tasks such as identifying, locating or performing visual reasoning around specific objects. Further, we extend our benchmark to high-stakes medical applications and introduce MED-HALLUCINOGEN, hallucination attacks tailored to the biomedical domain, and evaluate the hallucination performance of LVLMs on medical images, a critical area where precision is crucial. Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations of eight LVLMs and two hallucination mitigation strategies across multiple datasets to show that current generic and medical LVLMs remain susceptible to hallucination attacks.</p></details> |  |

These models, however, bring forth substantial challenges in the high consumption of computational, memory, energy, and financial resources, especially in environments with limited resource capabilities. This survey aims to systematically address these challenges by reviewing a broad spectrum of techniques designed to enhance the resource efficiency of LLMs. We categorize methods based on their optimization focus: computational, memory, energy, financial, and network resources and their applicability across various stages of an LLM's lifecycle, including architecture design, pretraining, finetuning, and system design. Additionally, the survey introduces a nuanced categorization of resource efficiency techniques by their specific resource types, which uncovers the intricate relationships and mappings between various resources and corresponding optimization techniques. A standardized set of evaluation metrics and datasets is also presented to facilitate consistent and fair comparisons across different models and techniques.

| **[Nullu: Mitigating Object Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models via HalluSpace Projection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13817v2)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown that large vision-language models (LVLMs) often suffer from the issue of object hallucinations (OH). To mitigate this issue, we introduce an efficient method that edits the model weights based on an unsafe subspace, which we call HalluSpace in this paper. With truthful and hallucinated text prompts accompanying the visual content as inputs, the HalluSpace can be identified by extracting the hallucinated embedding features and removing the truthful representations in LVLMs. By orthogonalizing the model weights, input features will be projected into the Null space of the HalluSpace to reduce OH, based on which we name our method Nullu. We reveal that HalluSpaces generally contain statistical bias and unimodal priors of the large language models (LLMs) applied to build LVLMs, which have been shown as essential causes of OH in previous studies. Therefore, null space projection suppresses the LLMs' priors to filter out the hallucinated features, resulting in contextually accurate outputs. Experiments show that our method can effectively mitigate OH across different LVLM families without extra inference costs and also show strong performance in general LVLM benchmarks. Code is released at \url{https://github.com/Ziwei-Zheng/Nullu}.</p></details> |  |

This work presents a generic framework to generate well-structured sentences from given tuples with the help of Large Language Models (LLMs). This study has focused on the following major questions: (i) how to generate sentences from relation tuples, (ii) how to compare and rank them, (iii) can we combine strengths of individual methods and amalgamate them to generate an even bette quality of sentences, and (iv) how to evaluate the final dataset? For the first question, we employ a multifaceted 5-stage pipeline approach, leveraging LLMs in conjunction with template-guided generation. We introduce Sentence Evaluation Index(SEI) that prioritizes factors like grammatical correctness, fluency, human-aligned sentiment, accuracy, and complexity to answer the first part of the second question. To answer the second part of the second question, this work introduces a SEI-Ranker module that leverages SEI to select top candidate generations. The top sentences are then strategically amalgamated to produce the final, high-quality sentence. Finally, we evaluate our dataset on LLM-based and SOTA baselines for relation classification. The proposed dataset features 255 relation types, with 15K sentences in the test set and around 150k in the train set organized in, significantly enhancing relational diversity and complexity. This work not only presents a new comprehensive benchmark dataset for RE/RC task, but also compare different LLMs for generation of quality sentences from relational tuples.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 Figures |
| **[Multi-Objective Large Language Model Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20412v1)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning in the domain of large language models (LLMs) has attracted great attention recently, which aims to effectively eliminate undesirable behaviors from LLMs without full retraining from scratch. In this paper, we explore the Gradient Ascent (GA) approach in LLM unlearning, which is a proactive way to decrease the prediction probability of the model on the target data in order to remove their influence. We analyze two challenges that render the process impractical: gradient explosion and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose Multi-Objective Large Language Model Unlearning (MOLLM) algorithm. We first formulate LLM unlearning as a multi-objective optimization problem, in which the cross-entropy loss is modified to the unlearning version to overcome the gradient explosion issue. A common descent update direction is then calculated, which enables the model to forget the target data while preserving the utility of the LLM. Our empirical results verify that MoLLM outperforms the SOTA GA-based LLM unlearning methods in terms of unlearning effect and model utility preservation.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM2: Let Large Language Models Harness System 2 Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20372v1)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across a myriad of tasks, yet they occasionally yield undesirable outputs. We posit that these limitations are rooted in the foundational autoregressive architecture of LLMs, which inherently lacks mechanisms for differentiating between desirable and undesirable results. Drawing inspiration from the dual-process theory of human cognition, we introduce LLM2, a novel framework that combines an LLM (System 1) with a process-based verifier (System 2). Within LLM2, the LLM is responsible for generating plausible candidates, while the verifier provides timely process-based feedback to distinguish desirable and undesirable outputs. The verifier is trained with a pairwise comparison loss on synthetic process-supervision data generated through our token quality exploration strategy. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks substantiate the efficacy of LLM2, exemplified by an accuracy enhancement from 50.3 to 57.8 (+7.5) for Llama3-1B on GSM8K. Furthermore, when combined with self-consistency, LLM2 achieves additional improvements, boosting major@20 accuracy from 56.2 to 70.2 (+14.0).</p></details> |  |

Most of the researches have focused on the English language only, because of its popularity and abundance on the internet. However, a high-performance language model for Hindi and other Indic languages is lacking in the literature. In this work, we have pre-trained two autoregressive LLM models for the Hindi language, namely HindiLLM-Small and HindiLLM-Medium. We use a two-step process comprising unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. First, we create a large and high-quality text corpus for unsupervised pre-training. Next, we train a Byte-Pair Encoding, named HindiLLM tokenizer, using the pre-training text data. We then perform training on the unlabeled data, known as the pre-training step, to get the HindiLLM base models. Furthermore, we perform fine-tuning of the HindiLLM base models for different tasks like sentiment analysis, text classification, natural language inference, and multiple choice question-answer on popular labeled datasets to measure the real-world performance. The evaluation shows that the HindiLLM-based fine-tuned models outperform several models in most of the language related tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distilling Desired Comments for Enhanced Code Review with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20340v1)** | 2024-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been a growing interest in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for code review thanks to their proven proficiency in code comprehension. The primary objective of most review scenarios is to generate desired review comments (DRCs) that explicitly identify issues to trigger code fixes. However, existing LLM-based solutions are not so effective in generating DRCs for various reasons such as hallucination. To enhance their code review ability, they need to be fine-tuned with a customized dataset that is ideally full of DRCs. Nevertheless, such a dataset is not yet available, while manual annotation of DRCs is too laborious to be practical. In this paper, we propose a dataset distillation method, Desiview, which can automatically construct a distilled dataset by identifying DRCs from a code review dataset. Experiments on the CodeReviewer dataset comprising more than 150K review entries show that Desiview achieves an impressive performance of 88.93%, 80.37%, 86.67%, and 84.44% in terms of Precision, Recall, Accuracy, and F1, respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. To validate the effect of such a distilled dataset on enhancing LLMs' code review ability, we first fine-tune the latest LLaMA series (i.e., LLaMA 3 and LLaMA 3.1) to build model Desiview4FT. We then enhance the model training effect through KTO alignment by feeding those review comments identified as non-DRCs to the LLMs, resulting in model Desiview4FA. Verification results indicate that Desiview4FA slightly outperforms Desiview4FT, while both models have significantly improved against the base models in terms of generating DRCs. Human evaluation confirms that both models identify issues more accurately and tend to generate review comments that better describe the issues contained in the code than the base LLMs do.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

However, hateful memes constantly evolve as new memes emerge by fusing progressive cultural ideas, making existing methods obsolete or ineffective. In this work, we explore the potential of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for hateful meme detection. To this end, we propose Evolver, which incorporates LMMs via Chain-of-Evolution (CoE) Prompting, by integrating the evolution attribute and in-context information of memes. Specifically, Evolver simulates the evolving and expressing process of memes and reasons through LMMs in a step-by-step manner. First, an evolutionary pair mining module retrieves the top-k most similar memes in the external curated meme set with the input meme. Second, an evolutionary information extractor is designed to summarize the semantic regularities between the paired memes for prompting. Finally, a contextual relevance amplifier enhances the in-context hatefulness information to boost the search for evolutionary processes. Extensive experiments on public FHM, MAMI, and HarM datasets show that CoE prompting can be incorporated into existing LMMs to improve their performance. More encouragingly, it can serve as an interpretive tool to promote the understanding of the evolution of social memes.</p></details> |  |

One such task in which LLMs are often employed is scoring, i.e., assigning a numerical value from a certain scale to a subject. In this paper, we strive to understand how LLMs score, specifically in the context of empathy scoring. We develop a novel and comprehensive framework for investigating how effective LLMs are at measuring and scoring empathy of responses in dialogues, and what methods can be employed to deepen our understanding of LLM scoring. Our strategy is to approximate the performance of state-of-the-art and fine-tuned LLMs with explicit and explainable features. We train classifiers using various features of dialogues including embeddings, the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Code, a set of explicit subfactors of empathy as proposed by LLMs, and a combination of the MITI Code and the explicit subfactors. Our results show that when only using embeddings, it is possible to achieve performance close to that of generic LLMs, and when utilizing the MITI Code and explicit subfactors scored by an LLM, the trained classifiers can closely match the performance of fine-tuned LLMs. We employ feature selection methods to derive the most crucial features in the process of empathy scoring. Our work provides a new perspective toward understanding LLM empathy scoring and helps the LLM community explore the potential of LLM scoring in social science studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE BigData 2024</p></details> |

While multiple existing works have investigated the social intelligence of LLMs, (1) most focus on a specific aspect, and the social intelligence of LLMs has yet to be systematically organized and studied; (2) position LLMs as passive observers from a third-person perspective, such as in Theory of Mind (ToM) tests. Compared to the third-person perspective, ego-centric first-person perspective evaluation can align well with actual LLM-based Agent use scenarios. (3) a lack of comprehensive evaluation of behavioral intelligence, with specific emphasis on incorporating critical human-machine interaction scenarios. In light of this, we present EgoSocialArena, a novel framework grounded in the three pillars of social intelligence: cognitive, situational, and behavioral intelligence, aimed to systematically evaluate the social intelligence of LLMs from a first-person perspective. With EgoSocialArena, we have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of eight prominent foundation models, even the most advanced LLMs like o1-preview lag behind human performance by 11.0 points.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new possibilities for processing side and context information within knowledge graphs. However, consistent integration across various systems remains challenging due to the need for domain expert intervention and differences in system characteristics. To address these issues, we propose a consistent approach that extracts both general and specific topics from both side and context information using LLMs. First, general topics are iteratively extracted and updated from side information. Then, specific topics are extracted using context information. Finally, to address synonymous topics generated during the specific topic extraction process, a refining algorithm processes and resolves these issues effectively. This approach allows general topics to capture broad knowledge across diverse item characteristics, while specific topics emphasize detailed attributes, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the semantic features of items and the preferences of users. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in recommendation performance across diverse knowledge graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The 40th ACM/SIGAPP Symposium On Applied Computing(SAC) 2025</p></details> |

However, processing the massive number of visual tokens incurs a significant computational cost. Existing analysis of the MLLM attention mechanisms remains shallow, leading to coarse-grain token pruning strategies that fail to effectively balance speed and accuracy. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of MLLM attention mechanisms with LLaVA. We find that numerous visual tokens and partial attention computations are redundant during the decoding process. Based on this insight, we propose Spatial-Temporal Visual Token Trimming ($\textbf{ST}^{3}$), a framework designed to accelerate MLLM inference without retraining. $\textbf{ST}^{3}$ consists of two primary components: 1) Progressive Visual Token Pruning (\textbf{PVTP}), which eliminates inattentive visual tokens across layers, and 2) Visual Token Annealing (\textbf{VTA}), which dynamically reduces the number of visual tokens in each layer as the generated tokens grow. Together, these techniques deliver around $\mathbf{2\times}$ faster inference with only about $\mathbf{30\%}$ KV cache memory compared to the original LLaVA, while maintaining consistent performance across various datasets. Crucially, $\textbf{ST}^{3}$ can be seamlessly integrated into existing pre-trained MLLMs, providing a plug-and-play solution for efficient inference.</p></details> | Accepted to AAAI2025 |

Despite their proficiency in various tasks, LLMs like PaLM 540B and Llama-3.1 405B face limitations due to large parameter sizes and computational demands, often requiring cloud API use which raises privacy concerns, limits real-time applications on edge devices, and increases fine-tuning costs. Additionally, LLMs often underperform in specialized domains such as healthcare and law due to insufficient domain-specific knowledge, necessitating specialized models. Therefore, Small Language Models (SLMs) are increasingly favored for their low inference latency, cost-effectiveness, efficient development, and easy customization and adaptability. These models are particularly well-suited for resource-limited environments and domain knowledge acquisition, addressing LLMs' challenges and proving ideal for applications that require localized data handling for privacy, minimal inference latency for efficiency, and domain knowledge acquisition through lightweight fine-tuning. The rising demand for SLMs has spurred extensive research and development. However, a comprehensive survey investigating issues related to the definition, acquisition, application, enhancement, and reliability of SLM remains lacking, prompting us to conduct a detailed survey on these topics. The definition of SLMs varies widely, thus to standardize, we propose defining SLMs by their capability to perform specialized tasks and suitability for resource-constrained settings, setting boundaries based on the minimal size for emergent abilities and the maximum size sustainable under resource constraints. For other aspects, we provide a taxonomy of relevant models/methods and develop general frameworks for each category to enhance and utilize SLMs effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>78 pa...</summary><p>78 pages, 32 figures, 14 tables</p></details> |

These data are widely scattered across publications, requiring automated collection methods. However, existing Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and their derivative data collection methods face challenges in accurate image detection and modal matching when processing archaeological catalogs, making automated collection difficult. To address these issues, we propose a novel archaeological catalog collection method based on Large Vision-Language Models that follows an approach comprising three modules: document localization, block comprehension and block matching. Through practical data collection from the Dabagou and Miaozigou pottery catalogs and comparison experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, providing a reliable solution for automated collection of archaeological catalogs.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages,4 figures,www source track</p></details> |

However, the limited access to realistic large-scale game environments has hindered research progress in this area. In this paper, we present AuctionNet, a benchmark for bid decision-making in large-scale ad auctions derived from a real-world online advertising platform. AuctionNet is composed of three parts: an ad auction environment, a pre-generated dataset based on the environment, and performance evaluations of several baseline bid decision-making algorithms. More specifically, the environment effectively replicates the integrity and complexity of real-world ad auctions through the interaction of several modules: the ad opportunity generation module employs deep generative networks to bridge the gap between simulated and real-world data while mitigating the risk of sensitive data exposure; the bidding module implements diverse auto-bidding agents trained with different decision-making algorithms; and the auction module is anchored in the classic Generalized Second Price (GSP) auction but also allows for customization of auction mechanisms as needed. To facilitate research and provide insights into the environment, we have also pre-generated a substantial dataset based on the environment. The dataset contains 10 million ad opportunities, 48 diverse auto-bidding agents, and over 500 million auction records. Performance evaluations of baseline algorithms such as linear programming, reinforcement learning, and generative models for bid decision-making are also presented as a part of AuctionNet. We believe that AuctionNet is applicable not only to research on bid decision-making in ad auctions but also to the general area of decision-making in large-scale games.</p></details> |  |

However, these instructions, encompassing images and text, are susceptible to both intentional and inadvertent attacks. Despite the critical importance of LVLMs' robustness against such threats, current research in this area remains limited. To bridge this gap, we introduce B-AVIBench, a framework designed to analyze the robustness of LVLMs when facing various Black-box Adversarial Visual-Instructions (B-AVIs), including four types of image-based B-AVIs, ten types of text-based B-AVIs, and nine types of content bias B-AVIs (such as gender, violence, cultural, and racial biases, among others). We generate 316K B-AVIs encompassing five categories of multimodal capabilities (ten tasks) and content bias. We then conduct a comprehensive evaluation involving 14 open-source LVLMs to assess their performance. B-AVIBench also serves as a convenient tool for practitioners to evaluate the robustness of LVLMs against B-AVIs. Our findings and extensive experimental results shed light on the vulnerabilities of LVLMs, and highlight that inherent biases exist even in advanced closed-source LVLMs like GeminiProVision and GPT-4V. This underscores the importance of enhancing the robustness, security, and fairness of LVLMs. The source code and benchmark are available at https://github.com/zhanghao5201/B-AVIBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics & Security</p></details> |

Such people face challenges in performing activities of daily living, such as reading, writing, traveling and participating in social gatherings. Many traditional approaches are available to help visually impaired people; however, these are limited in obtaining contextually rich environmental information necessary for independent living. In order to overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a novel wearable vision assistance system that has a hat-mounted camera connected to a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (8GB RAM) with artificial intelligence (AI) technology to deliver real-time feedback to a user through a sound beep mechanism. The key features of this system include a user-friendly procedure for the recognition of new people or objects through a one-click process that allows users to add data on new individuals and objects for later detection, enhancing the accuracy of the recognition over time. The system provides detailed descriptions of objects in the user's environment using a large vision language model (LVLM). In addition, it incorporates a distance sensor that activates a beeping sound using a buzzer as soon as the user is about to collide with an object, helping to ensure safety while navigating their environment. A comprehensive evaluation is carried out to evaluate the proposed AI-based solution against traditional support techniques. Comparative analysis shows that the proposed solution with its innovative combination of hardware and AI (including LVLMs with IoT), is a significant advancement in assistive technology that aims to solve the major issues faced by the community of visually impaired people</p></details> | N-A |

Investigating Large Language Models as Re-Ranking Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09542v3)** | 2024-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot generalization across various language-related tasks, including search engines. However, existing work utilizes the generative ability of LLMs for Information Retrieval (IR) rather than direct passage ranking. The discrepancy between the pre-training objectives of LLMs and the ranking objective poses another challenge. In this paper, we first investigate generative LLMs such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 for relevance ranking in IR. Surprisingly, our experiments reveal that properly instructed LLMs can deliver competitive, even superior results to state-of-the-art supervised methods on popular IR benchmarks. Furthermore, to address concerns about data contamination of LLMs, we collect a new test set called NovelEval, based on the latest knowledge and aiming to verify the model's ability to rank unknown knowledge. Finally, to improve efficiency in real-world applications, we delve into the potential for distilling the ranking capabilities of ChatGPT into small specialized models using a permutation distillation scheme. Our evaluation results turn out that a distilled 440M model outperforms a 3B supervised model on the BEIR benchmark.

However, the predominant pretraining of LLMs on extensive web-based texts remains insufficient for advanced scientific discovery, particularly in chemistry. The scarcity of specialized chemistry data, coupled with the complexity of multi-modal data such as 2D graph, 3D structure and spectrum, present distinct challenges. Although several studies have reviewed Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) in chemistry, there is a conspicuous absence of a systematic survey specifically focused on chemistry-oriented LLMs. In this paper, we outline methodologies for incorporating domain-specific chemistry knowledge and multi-modal information into LLMs, we also conceptualize chemistry LLMs as agents using chemistry tools and investigate their potential to accelerate scientific research. Additionally, we conclude the existing benchmarks to evaluate chemistry ability of LLMs. Finally, we critically examine the current challenges and identify promising directions for future research. Through this comprehensive survey, we aim to assist researchers in staying at the forefront of developments in chemistry LLMs and to inspire innovative applications in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>COLIN...</summary><p>COLING2025,We maintain an up-to-date Github repository at: https://github.com/OpenDFM/LLM4Chemistry</p></details> |

Unlike previous methods that struggle in real-world scenarios or lack interactive editing capabilities, ChatGarment can estimate sewing patterns from in-the-wild images or sketches, generate them from text descriptions, and edit garments based on user instructions, all within an interactive dialogue. These sewing patterns can then be draped into 3D garments, which are easily animatable and simulatable. This is achieved by finetuning a VLM to directly generate a JSON file that includes both textual descriptions of garment types and styles, as well as continuous numerical attributes. This JSON file is then used to create sewing patterns through a programming parametric model. To support this, we refine the existing programming model, GarmentCode, by expanding its garment type coverage and simplifying its structure for efficient VLM fine-tuning. Additionally, we construct a large-scale dataset of image-to-sewing-pattern and text-to-sewing-pattern pairs through an automated data pipeline. Extensive evaluations demonstrate ChatGarment's ability to accurately reconstruct, generate, and edit garments from multimodal inputs, highlighting its potential to revolutionize workflows in fashion and gaming applications.

Despite their great potential, LLMs usually require dedicated pre-training and fine-tuning for domain-specific applications such as wireless networks. These adaptations can be extremely demanding for computational resources and datasets, while most network devices have limited computation power, and there are a limited number of high-quality networking datasets. To this end, this work explores LLM-enabled wireless networks from the prompt engineering perspective, i.e., designing prompts to guide LLMs to generate desired output without updating LLM parameters. Compared with other LLM-driven methods, prompt engineering can better align with the demands of wireless network devices, e.g., higher deployment flexibility, rapid response time, and lower requirements on computation power. In particular, this work first introduces LLM fundamentals and compares different prompting techniques such as in-context learning, chain-of-thought, and self-refinement. Then we propose two novel prompting schemes for network applications: iterative prompting for network optimization, and self-refined prompting for network prediction. The case studies show that the proposed schemes can achieve comparable performance as conventional machine learning techniques, and our proposed prompting-based methods avoid the complexity of dedicated model training and fine-tuning, which is one of the key bottlenecks of existing machine learning techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning over Uncertain Text by Generative Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09614v3)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers the challenges Large Language Models (LLMs) face when reasoning over text that includes information involving uncertainty explicitly quantified via probability values. This type of reasoning is relevant to a variety of contexts ranging from everyday conversations to medical decision-making. Despite improvements in the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, they still exhibit significant difficulties when it comes to probabilistic reasoning. To deal with this problem, we introduce the Bayesian Linguistic Inference Dataset (BLInD), a new dataset specifically designed to test the probabilistic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We use BLInD to find out the limitations of LLMs for tasks involving probabilistic reasoning. In addition, we present several prompting strategies that map the problem to different formal representations, including Python code, probabilistic algorithms, and probabilistic logical programming. We conclude by providing an evaluation of our methods on BLInD and an adaptation of a causal reasoning question-answering dataset. Our empirical results highlight the effectiveness of our proposed strategies for multiple LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Adapt to Other Agents In-Context?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19726v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the research community aims to build better AI assistants that are more dynamic and personalized to the diversity of humans that they interact with, there is increased interest in evaluating the theory of mind capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Indeed, several recent studies suggest that LLM theory of mind capabilities are quite impressive, approximating human-level performance. Our paper aims to rebuke this narrative and argues instead that past studies were not directly measuring agent performance, potentially leading to findings that are illusory in nature as a result. We draw a strong distinction between what we call literal theory of mind i.e. measuring the agent's ability to predict the behavior of others and functional theory of mind i.e. adapting to agents in-context based on a rational response to predictions of their behavior. We find that top performing open source LLMs may display strong capabilities in literal theory of mind, depending on how they are prompted, but seem to struggle with functional theory of mind -- even when partner policies are exceedingly simple. Our work serves to highlight the double sided nature of inductive bias in LLMs when adapting to new situations. While this bias can lead to strong performance over limited horizons, it often hinders convergence to optimal long-term behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Adaptive Reasoning in Large Language Models with Thought Rollback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19707v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been routinely used to solve various tasks using step-by-step reasoning. However, the structure of intermediate reasoning steps, or thoughts, is rigid and unidirectional, such as chains, trees, or acyclic-directed graphs. Consequently, the resulting inflexible and forward-only reasoning may not address challenging tasks and fail when the LLM frequently gives false responses, i.e., ``hallucinations''. This paper proposes a new reasoning framework, called Thought Rollback (TR), allowing LLMs to adaptively build thought structure while maintaining effective reasoning toward problem-solving under ``hallucinations''. The core mechanism of TR is rolling back thoughts, which allows LLMs to perform error analysis on thoughts, and thus roll back to any previously mistaken thought for revision. Subsequently, by including such trial-and-error in the prompt to guide the LLM, each rollback leads to one more reliable reasoning path. Therefore, starting with a simple prompt without human annotations, LLM with TR adaptively and gradually explores thoughts for a correct solution. Comprehensive experiments on mathematical problems and multi-task reasoning demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of TR in terms of problem-solving rate and interaction cost. For instance, the solving rate of GPT-4 with TR outperforms the current best by $9\%$ on the MATH dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024 camera-ready version with 24 pages and 12 figures.

Traditional approaches often model this challenge as a variant of image segmentation, treating the binary segmentation of forged areas as the end product. We argue that the basic binary forgery mask is inadequate for explaining model predictions. It doesn't clarify why the model pinpoints certain areas and treats all forged pixels the same, making it hard to spot the most fake-looking parts. In this study, we mitigate the aforementioned limitations by generating salient region-focused interpretation for the forgery images. To support this, we craft a Multi-Modal Tramper Tracing (MMTT) dataset, comprising facial images manipulated using deepfake techniques and paired with manual, interpretable textual annotations. To harvest high-quality annotation, annotators are instructed to meticulously observe the manipulated images and articulate the typical characteristics of the forgery regions. Subsequently, we collect a dataset of 128,303 image-text pairs. Leveraging the MMTT dataset, we develop ForgeryTalker, an architecture designed for concurrent forgery localization and interpretation. ForgeryTalker first trains a forgery prompter network to identify the pivotal clues within the explanatory text. Subsequently, the region prompter is incorporated into multimodal large language model for finetuning to achieve the dual goals of localization and interpretation. Extensive experiments conducted on the MMTT dataset verify the superior performance of our proposed model. The dataset, code as well as pretrained checkpoints will be made publicly available to facilitate further research and ensure the reproducibility of our results.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 4 tabels</p></details> |

It examines artefacts and events particularly timestamps and metadata to detect anomalies, establish correlations, and reconstruct incident timelines. Traditional methods rely on structured artefacts, such as logs and filesystem metadata, using specialised tools for evidence identification and feature extraction. This paper introduces GenDFIR, a framework leveraging large language models (LLMs), specifically Llama 3.1 8B in zero shot mode, integrated with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent. Incident data is preprocessed into a structured knowledge base, enabling the RAG agent to retrieve relevant events based on user prompts. The LLM interprets this context, offering semantic enrichment. Tested on synthetic data in a controlled environment, results demonstrate GenDFIR's reliability and robustness, showcasing LLMs potential to automate timeline analysis and advance threat detection.</p></details> | 24 pages V5.3 |

Although SSL has been proven effective in speech and audio, its application to music audio has yet to be thoroughly explored. This is partially due to the distinctive challenges associated with modelling musical knowledge, particularly tonal and pitched characteristics of music. To address this research gap, we propose an acoustic Music undERstanding model with large-scale self-supervised Training (MERT), which incorporates teacher models to provide pseudo labels in the masked language modelling (MLM) style acoustic pre-training. In our exploration, we identified an effective combination of teacher models, which outperforms conventional speech and audio approaches in terms of performance. This combination includes an acoustic teacher based on Residual Vector Quantisation - Variational AutoEncoder (RVQ-VAE) and a musical teacher based on the Constant-Q Transform (CQT). Furthermore, we explore a wide range of settings to overcome the instability in acoustic language model pre-training, which allows our designed paradigm to scale from 95M to 330M parameters. Experimental results indicate that our model can generalise and perform well on 14 music understanding tasks and attain state-of-the-art (SOTA) overall scores.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICLR 2024</p></details> |

These models, by leveraging the power of deep learning and massive amounts of data, have demonstrated an unprecedented capacity to understand, generate, and operate programming languages. They can assist developers in completing a broad spectrum of software development activities, encompassing software design, automated programming, and maintenance, which potentially reduces huge human efforts. Integrating LLMs within the SE landscape (LLM4SE) has become a burgeoning trend, necessitating exploring this emergent landscape's challenges and opportunities. The paper aims at revisiting the software development life cycle (SDLC) under LLMs, and highlighting challenges and opportunities of the new paradigm.

The large parameter size of VLMs brings large memory and computation overhead which poses significant challenges for deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is an effective technique to reduce the memory and computation overhead. Existing PTQ methods mainly focus on large language models (LLMs), without considering the differences across other modalities. In this paper, we discover that there is a significant difference in sensitivity between language and vision tokens in large VLMs. Therefore, treating tokens from different modalities equally, as in existing PTQ methods, may over-emphasize the insensitive modalities, leading to significant accuracy loss. To deal with the above issue, we propose a simple yet effective method, Modality-Balanced Quantization (MBQ), for large VLMs. Specifically, MBQ incorporates the different sensitivities across modalities during the calibration process to minimize the reconstruction loss for better quantization parameters. Extensive experiments show that MBQ can significantly improve task accuracy by up to 4.4% and 11.6% under W3 and W4A8 quantization for 7B to 70B VLMs, compared to SOTA baselines. Additionally, we implement a W3 GPU kernel that fuses the dequantization and GEMV operators, achieving a 1.4x speedup on LLaVA-onevision-7B on the RTX 4090.

Current researches on privacy assessment for LVLMs is limited in scope, with gaps in both assessment dimensions and privacy categories. To bridge this gap, we propose Multi-P$^2$A, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the privacy preservation capabilities of LVLMs in terms of privacy awareness and leakage. Privacy awareness measures the model's ability to recognize the privacy sensitivity of input data, while privacy leakage assesses the risk of the model unintentionally disclosing privacy information in its output. We design a range of sub-tasks to thoroughly evaluate the model's privacy protection offered by LVLMs. Multi-P$^2$A covers 26 categories of personal privacy, 15 categories of trade secrets, and 18 categories of state secrets, totaling 31,962 samples. Based on Multi-P$^2$A, we evaluate the privacy preservation capabilities of 21 open-source and 2 closed-source LVLMs. Our results reveal that current LVLMs generally pose a high risk of facilitating privacy breaches, with vulnerabilities varying across personal privacy, trade secret, and state secret.</p></details> |  |

We simulate real-world IR dynamics through various team structures, including centralized, decentralized, and hybrid configurations. By analyzing agent interactions and performance across these setups, we provide insights into optimizing multi-agent collaboration for incident response.

| **[Exploring Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Techniques for Code Generation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10462v3)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities to generate accurate code snippets given natural language intents in a zero-shot manner, i.e., without the need for specific fine-tuning. While prior studies have highlighted the advantages of fine-tuning LLMs, this process incurs high computational costs, making it impractical in resource-scarce environments, particularly for models with billions of parameters. To address these challenges, previous research explored in-context learning (ICL) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) as strategies to guide the LLM generative process with task-specific prompt examples. However, ICL and RAG introduce inconveniences, such as the need for designing contextually relevant prompts and the absence of learning task-specific parameters, thereby limiting downstream task performance. In this context, we foresee parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) as a promising approach to efficiently specialize LLMs to task-specific data while maintaining reasonable resource consumption. In this paper, we deliver a comprehensive study of PEFT techniques for LLMs in the context of automated code generation. Our comprehensive investigation of PEFT techniques for LLMs reveals their superiority and potential over ICL and RAG across a diverse set of LLMs and three representative Python code generation datasets: Conala, CodeAlpacaPy, and APPS. Furthermore, our study highlights the potential for tuning larger LLMs and significant reductions in memory usage by combining PEFT with quantization. Therefore, this study opens opportunities for broader applications of PEFT in software engineering scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/martin-wey/peft-llm-code/.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeUltraFeedback: An LLM-as-a-Judge Dataset for Aligning Large Language Models to Coding Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09032v3)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with user-defined coding preferences is a challenging endeavour that requires a deep assessment of LLMs' outputs. Existing methods and benchmarks rely primarily on automated metrics and static analysis tools, which often fail to capture the nuances of user instructions and LLM outputs. To address this gap, we propose using the LLM-as-a-Judge methodology to evaluate the alignment of LLMs with coding preferences. Based on this approach, we present CodeUltraFeedback, a comprehensive dataset designed to facilitate the evaluation and improvement of LLM alignment. CodeUltraFeedback consists of 10,000 coding instructions, each annotated with four responses generated from a diverse pool of 14 LLMs. These responses are ranked based on five distinct coding preferences using GPT-3.5 as a judge, providing both numerical scores and detailed textual feedback. Our analysis of CodeUltraFeedback reveals that responses from GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are generally preferred over those from open-weight LLMs, highlighting significant differences in alignment between closed and open-weight models. In turn, we explore the usage of CodeUltraFeedback as feedback data to fine-tune and align CodeLlama-7B-Instruct using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) with direct preference optimization (DPO). The resulting aligned CodeLlama-7B-Instruct model outperforms larger LLMs in terms of alignment with coding preferences and shows improved functional correctness on the HumanEval+ benchmark compared to the original instruct model. Therefore, our contributions bridge the gap in preference tuning of LLMs for code and set the stage for further advancements in model alignment and RLAIF in automated software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Find the Intention of Instruction: Comprehensive Evaluation of Instruction Understanding for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19450v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the key strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to interact with humans by generating appropriate responses to given instructions. This ability, known as instruction-following capability, has established a foundation for the use of LLMs across various fields and serves as a crucial metric for evaluating their performance. While numerous evaluation benchmarks have been developed, most focus solely on clear and coherent instructions. However, we have noted that LLMs can become easily distracted by instruction-formatted statements, which may lead to an oversight of their instruction comprehension skills. To address this issue, we introduce the Intention of Instruction (IoInst) benchmark. This benchmark evaluates LLMs' capacity to remain focused and understand instructions without being misled by extraneous instructions. The primary objective of this benchmark is to identify the appropriate instruction that accurately guides the generation of a given context. Our findings suggest that even recently introduced state-of-the-art models still lack instruction understanding capability. Along with the proposition of IoInst in this study, we also present broad analyses of the several strategies potentially applicable to IoInst.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[Feature Alignment-Based Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Compression of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19449v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study proposes a knowledge distillation algorithm based on large language models and feature alignment, aiming to effectively transfer the knowledge of large pre-trained models into lightweight student models, thereby reducing computational costs while maintaining high model performance. Different from the traditional soft label distillation method, this method introduces a multi-layer feature alignment strategy to deeply align the intermediate features and attention mechanisms of the teacher model and the student model, maximally retaining the semantic expression ability and context modeling ability of the teacher model. In terms of method design, a multi-task loss function is constructed, including feature matching loss, attention alignment loss, and output distribution matching loss, to ensure multi-level information transfer through joint optimization. The experiments were comprehensively evaluated on the GLUE data set and various natural language processing tasks. The results show that the proposed model performs very close to the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model in terms of evaluation indicators such as perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE, and CER. At the same time, it far exceeds baseline models such as DeBERTa, XLNet, and GPT-3, showing significant performance improvements and computing efficiency advantages. Research results show that the feature alignment distillation strategy is an effective model compression method that can significantly reduce computational overhead and storage requirements while maintaining model capabilities. Future research can be further expanded in the directions of self-supervised learning, cross-modal feature alignment, and multi-task transfer learning to provide more flexible and efficient solutions for the deployment and optimization of deep learning models.</p></details> | 4 pages |
| **[A Survey on Large Language Model Acceleration based on KV Cache Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19442v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized a wide range of domains such as natural language processing, computer vision, and multi-modal tasks due to their ability to comprehend context and perform logical reasoning. However, the computational and memory demands of LLMs, particularly during inference, pose significant challenges when scaling them to real-world, long-context, and real-time applications. Key-Value (KV) cache management has emerged as a critical optimization technique for accelerating LLM inference by reducing redundant computations and improving memory utilization. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of KV cache management strategies for LLM acceleration, categorizing them into token-level, model-level, and system-level optimizations. Token-level strategies include KV cache selection, budget allocation, merging, quantization, and low-rank decomposition, while model-level optimizations focus on architectural innovations and attention mechanisms to enhance KV reuse. System-level approaches address memory management, scheduling, and hardware-aware designs to improve efficiency across diverse computing environments. Additionally, the survey provides an overview of both text and multimodal datasets and benchmarks used to evaluate these strategies. By presenting detailed taxonomies and comparative analyses, this work aims to offer useful insights for researchers and practitioners to support the development of efficient and scalable KV cache management techniques, contributing to the practical deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.

| **[A Matrix Logic Approach to Efficient Frequent Itemset Discovery in Large Data Sets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19420v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a frequent itemset mining algorithm based on the Boolean matrix method, aiming to solve the storage and computational bottlenecks of traditional frequent pattern mining algorithms in high-dimensional and large-scale transaction databases. By representing the itemsets in the transaction database as Boolean matrices, the algorithm uses Boolean logic operations such as AND and OR to efficiently calculate the support of the itemsets, avoiding the generation and storage of a large number of candidates itemsets in traditional algorithms. The algorithm recursively mines frequent itemsets through matrix operations and can flexibly adapt to different data scales and support thresholds. In the experiment, the public Groceries dataset was selected, and the running efficiency test and frequent itemset mining effect test were designed to evaluate the algorithm's performance indicators such as running time, memory usage, and number of frequent itemsets under different transaction numbers and support thresholds. The experimental results show that the algorithm can efficiently mine a large number of frequent itemsets when the support threshold is low, and focus on strong association rules with high support when the threshold is high. In addition, the changing trends of running time and memory usage show that the Boolean matrix method can still maintain good running efficiency when the number of transactions increases significantly and has high scalability and robustness. Future research can improve memory optimization and matrix block operations, and combine distributed computing and deep learning models to further enhance the algorithm's applicability and real-time processing capabilities in ultra-large-scale data environments. The algorithm has broad application potential and development prospects in the fields of market analysis, recommendation systems, and network security.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a large-scale measurement study of the Starlink network, the largest LEO satellite constellation to date. We begin by proposing an efficient method for discovering active Starlink user routers, identifying approximately 3.2 million IPv6 addresses across 102 countries and 123 regions-representing, to the best of our knowledge, the most complete list of Starlink user routers' active IPv6 addresses. Based on the discovered user routers, we map the Starlink backbone network, which consists of 33 Points of Presence (PoPs) and 70 connections between them. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed statistical analysis of active Starlink users and PoPs. Finally, we summarize the IPv6 address assignment strategy adopted by the Starlink network.

In this paper, MLLMs are utilized to solve joint semantic scene understanding and risk localization tasks, while only relying on front-view images. In the proposed MLLM-SUL framework, a dual-branch visual encoder is first designed to extract features from two resolutions, and rich visual information is conducive to the language model describing risk objects of different sizes accurately. Then for the language generation, LLaMA model is fine-tuned to predict scene descriptions, containing the type of driving scenario, actions of risk objects, and driving intentions and suggestions of ego-vehicle. Ultimately, a transformer-based network incorporating a regression token is trained to locate the risk objects. Extensive experiments on the existing DRAMA-ROLISP dataset and the extended DRAMA-SRIS dataset demonstrate that our method is efficient, surpassing many state-of-the-art image-based and video-based methods. Specifically, our method achieves 80.1% BLEU-1 score and 298.5% CIDEr score in the scene understanding task, and 59.6% accuracy in the localization task.

| **[Towards General Industrial Intelligence: A Survey of Continual Large Models in Industrial IoT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01207v2)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial AI is transitioning from traditional deep learning models to large-scale transformer-based architectures, with the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) playing a pivotal role. IIoT evolves from a simple data pipeline to an intelligent infrastructure, enabling and enhancing these advanced AI systems. This survey explores the integration of IIoT with large models (LMs) and their potential applications in industrial environments. We focus on four primary types of industrial LMs: language-based, vision-based, time-series, and multimodal models. The lifecycle of LMs is segmented into four critical phases: data foundation, model training, model connectivity, and continuous evolution. First, we analyze how IIoT provides abundant and diverse data resources, supporting the training and fine-tuning of LMs. Second, we discuss how IIoT offers an efficient training infrastructure in low-latency and bandwidth-optimized environments. Third, we highlight the deployment advantages of LMs within IIoT, emphasizing IIoT's role as a connectivity nexus fostering emergent intelligence through modular design, dynamic routing, and model merging to enhance system scalability and adaptability. Finally, we demonstrate how IIoT supports continual learning mechanisms, enabling LMs to adapt to dynamic industrial conditions and ensure long-term effectiveness. This paper underscores IIoT's critical role in the evolution of industrial intelligence with large models, offering a theoretical framework and actionable insights for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[PyraNet: A Large Scale Hierarchical Verilog Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06947v2)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there has been a growing interest in leveraging Large Language Models for Verilog code generation. However, the current quality of the generated Verilog code remains suboptimal. This is largely due to the absence of well-defined, well-organized datasets with high-quality samples, as well as a lack of innovative fine-tuning methods and models specifically trained on Verilog. In this paper, we introduce a novel open-source dataset and a corresponding fine-tuning technique, which utilizes a multi-layered structure that we refer to as PyraNet. Our experiments demonstrate that employing the proposed dataset and fine-tuning approach leads to a more accurate fine-tuned model, producing syntactically and functionally correct Verilog code. The evaluation results show improvements by up-to $32.6\%$ in comparison to the CodeLlama-7B baseline model and up-to $16.7\%$ in comparison to the state-of-the-art models using VerilogEval evaluation platform.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Engorgio Prompt Makes Large Language Model Babble on](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19394v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auto-regressive large language models (LLMs) have yielded impressive performance in many real-world tasks. However, the new paradigm of these LLMs also exposes novel threats. In this paper, we explore their vulnerability to inference cost attacks, where a malicious user crafts Engorgio prompts to intentionally increase the computation cost and latency of the inference process. We design Engorgio, a novel methodology, to efficiently generate adversarial Engorgio prompts to affect the target LLM's service availability. Engorgio has the following two technical contributions. (1) We employ a parameterized distribution to track LLMs' prediction trajectory. (2) Targeting the auto-regressive nature of LLMs' inference process, we propose novel loss functions to stably suppress the appearance of the <EOS> token, whose occurrence will interrupt the LLM's generation process. We conduct extensive experiments on 13 open-sourced LLMs with parameters ranging from 125M to 30B. The results show that Engorgio prompts can successfully induce LLMs to generate abnormally long outputs (i.e., roughly 2-13$\times$ longer to reach 90%+ of the output length limit) in a white-box scenario and our real-world experiment demonstrates Engergio's threat to LLM service with limited computing resources.

| **[A blueprint for large-scale quantum-network deployments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01069v2)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum Communications is a field that promises advances in cryptography, quantum computing and clock synchronisation, among other potential applications. However, communication based on quantum phenomena requires an extreme level of isolation from external disturbances, making the transmission of quantum signals together with classical ones difficult. A range of techniques has been tested to introduce quantum communications in already deployed optical networks which also carry legacy traffic. This comes with challenges, not only at the physical layer but also at the operations and management layer. To achieve a broad acceptance among network operators, the joint management and operation of quantum and classical resources, compliance with standards, and quality and legal assurance need to be addressed. This article presents a detailed account of solutions to the above issues, deployed and evaluated in the MadQCI (Madrid Quantum Communication Infrastructure) testbed. This network is designed to integrate quantum communications in the telecommunications ecosystem by installing quantum-key-distribution modules from multiple providers in production nodes of two different operators. The modules were connected through an optical-switched network with more than 130 km of deployed optical fibre. The tests were done in compliance with strict service level agreements that protected the legacy traffic of the pre-existing classical network. The goal was to achieve full quantum-classical compatibility at all levels, while limiting the modifications of optical transport and encryption and complying with as many standards as possible. This effort was intended to serve as a blueprint, which can be used as the foundation of large-scale quantum network deployments. To demonstrate the capabilities of MadQCI, end-to-end encryption services were deployed and a variety of use-cases were showcased.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Large Language Models for Market Research: A Data-augmentation Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19363v1)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed artificial intelligence by excelling in complex natural language processing tasks. Their ability to generate human-like text has opened new possibilities for market research, particularly in conjoint analysis, where understanding consumer preferences is essential but often resource-intensive. Traditional survey-based methods face limitations in scalability and cost, making LLM-generated data a promising alternative. However, while LLMs have the potential to simulate real consumer behavior, recent studies highlight a significant gap between LLM-generated and human data, with biases introduced when substituting between the two. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a novel statistical data augmentation approach that efficiently integrates LLM-generated data with real data in conjoint analysis. Our method leverages transfer learning principles to debias the LLM-generated data using a small amount of human data. This results in statistically robust estimators with consistent and asymptotically normal properties, in contrast to naive approaches that simply substitute human data with LLM-generated data, which can exacerbate bias. We validate our framework through an empirical study on COVID-19 vaccine preferences, demonstrating its superior ability to reduce estimation error and save data and costs by 24.9\% to 79.8\%. In contrast, naive approaches fail to save data due to the inherent biases in LLM-generated data compared to human data. Another empirical study on sports car choices validates the robustness of our results. Our findings suggest that while LLM-generated data is not a direct substitute for human responses, it can serve as a valuable complement when used within a robust statistical framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Skill Adaptation for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19361v1)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Dynamic Skill Adaptation (DSA), an adaptive and dynamic framework to adapt novel and complex skills to Large Language Models (LLMs). Compared with previous work which learns from human-curated and static data in random orders, we propose to first automatically generate and organize the training data by mimicking the learning pathways of human and then dynamically tailor the training data based on the training dynamics. Specifically, inspired by the learning structures and teaching strategies in the human education system, we first construct a skill graph by decomposing complex skills into sub-skills and arranging them based on their dependencies in human syllables. For every skill, we utilize LLMs to generate both textbook-like data which contains detailed descriptions of skills for pre-training and exercise-like data which targets at explicitly utilizing the skills to solve problems for instruction-tuning. Furthermore, during the instruction-tuning, we dynamically update the training data which down-weight easy-to-learn examples, generate more complex examples, and filter out data with errors. Experiments on large language models such as LLAMA and Mistral demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods in adapting math reasoning skills and social study skills.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semi-Supervised Learning from Small Annotated Data and Large Unlabeled Data for Fine-grained PICO Entity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19346v1)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: Extracting PICO elements -- Participants, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcomes -- from clinical trial literature is essential for clinical evidence retrieval, appraisal, and synthesis. Existing approaches do not distinguish the attributes of PICO entities. This study aims to develop a named entity recognition (NER) model to extract PICO entities with fine granularities. Materials and Methods: Using a corpus of 2,511 abstracts with PICO mentions from 4 public datasets, we developed a semi-supervised method to facilitate the training of a NER model, FinePICO, by combining limited annotated data of PICO entities and abundant unlabeled data. For evaluation, we divided the entire dataset into two subsets: a smaller group with annotations and a larger group without annotations. We then established the theoretical lower and upper performance bounds based on the performance of supervised learning models trained solely on the small, annotated subset and on the entire set with complete annotations, respectively. Finally, we evaluated FinePICO on both the smaller annotated subset and the larger, initially unannotated subset. We measured the performance of FinePICO using precision, recall, and F1. Results: Our method achieved precision/recall/F1 of 0.567/0.636/0.60, respectively, using a small set of annotated samples, outperforming the baseline model (F1: 0.437) by more than 16\%. The model demonstrates generalizability to a different PICO framework and to another corpus, which consistently outperforms the benchmark in diverse experimental settings (p-value \textless0.001). Conclusion: This study contributes a generalizable and effective semi-supervised approach to named entity recognition leveraging large unlabeled data together with small, annotated data. It also initially supports fine-grained PICO extraction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards A Holistic Landscape of Situated Theory of Mind in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19619v2)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have generated considerable interest and debate regarding their potential emergence of Theory of Mind (ToM). Several recent inquiries reveal a lack of robust ToM in these models and pose a pressing demand to develop new benchmarks, as current ones primarily focus on different aspects of ToM and are prone to shortcuts and data leakage. In this position paper, we seek to answer two road-blocking questions: (1) How can we taxonomize a holistic landscape of machine ToM? (2) What is a more effective evaluation protocol for machine ToM? Following psychological studies, we taxonomize machine ToM into 7 mental state categories and delineate existing benchmarks to identify under-explored aspects of ToM. We argue for a holistic and situated evaluation of ToM to break ToM into individual components and treat LLMs as an agent who is physically situated in environments and socially situated in interactions with humans. Such situated evaluation provides a more comprehensive assessment of mental states and potentially mitigates the risk of shortcuts and data leakage. We further present a pilot study in a grid world setup as a proof of concept. We hope this position paper can facilitate future research to integrate ToM with LLMs and offer an intuitive means for researchers to better position their work in the landscape of ToM.

While some works have demonstrated the capability of LVLMs to generate segmentation masks that align phrases with natural language descriptions in a single image, they struggle with segmentation-grounded comparisons across multiple images, particularly at finer granularities such as object parts. In this paper, we introduce the new task of part-focused semantic co-segmentation, which seeks to identify and segment common and unique objects and parts across images. To address this task, we present CALICO, the first LVLM that can segment and reason over multiple masks across images, enabling object comparison based on their constituent parts. CALICO features two proposed components, a novel Correspondence Extraction Module, which captures semantic-rich information to identify part-level correspondences between objects, and a Correspondence Adaptation Module, which embeds this information into the LVLM to facilitate multi-image understanding in a parameter-efficient manner. To support training and evaluation, we curate MixedParts, a comprehensive multi-image segmentation dataset containing $\sim$2.4M samples across $\sim$44K images with diverse object and part categories. Experimental results show CALICO, finetuned on only 0.3% of its architecture, achieves robust performance in part-focused semantic co-segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://plan-lab.github.io/calico</p></details> |

Recent studies either develop tool-using or unify specific visual tasks into the autoregressive framework, often at the expense of overall multimodal performance. To address this issue and enhance MLLMs with visual tasks in a scalable fashion, we propose Task Preference Optimization (TPO), a novel method that utilizes differentiable task preferences derived from typical fine-grained visual tasks. TPO introduces learnable task tokens that establish connections between multiple task-specific heads and the MLLM. By leveraging rich visual labels during training, TPO significantly enhances the MLLM's multimodal capabilities and task-specific performance. Through multi-task co-training within TPO, we observe synergistic benefits that elevate individual task performance beyond what is achievable through single-task training methodologies. Our instantiation of this approach with VideoChat and LLaVA demonstrates an overall 14.6% improvement in multimodal performance compared to baseline models. Additionally, MLLM-TPO demonstrates robust zero-shot capabilities across various tasks, performing comparably to state-of-the-art supervised models. The code will be released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/TPO</p></details> | technical report |

In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach called Social Robot Planner (SRLM), which integrates Large Language Models (LLM) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to navigate through human-filled public spaces and provide multiple social services. SRLM infers global planning from human-in-loop commands in real-time, and encodes social information into a LLM-based large navigation model (LNM) for low-level motion execution. Moreover, a DRL-based planner is designed to maintain benchmarking performance, which is blended with LNM by a large feedback model (LFM) to address the instability of current text and LLM-driven LNM. Finally, SRLM demonstrates outstanding performance in extensive experiments. More details about this work are available at: https://sites.google.com/view/navi-srlm</p></details> |  |

With the emergence of large models, time series foundation models (TSFMs) have exhibited remarkable generalization capabilities, such as zero-shot learning, through large-scale pre-training. Meanwhile, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have been widely employed to enhance the performance of foundation models on unseen data, allowing models to access to external knowledge. In this paper, we introduce TimeRAF, a Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting model that enhance zero-shot time series forecasting through retrieval-augmented techniques. We develop customized time series knowledge bases that are tailored to the specific forecasting tasks. TimeRAF employs an end-to-end learnable retriever to extract valuable information from the knowledge base. Additionally, we propose Channel Prompting for knowledge integration, which effectively extracts relevant information from the retrieved knowledge along the channel dimension. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, showing significant improvement across various domains and datasets.</p></details> |  |

While it is long known that neural networks can incorporate soft constraints with techniques such as regularization, strict adherence to hard constraints is generally more difficult. A recent advance in this field, however, has addressed this problem by enabling the direct embedding of optimization layers as differentiable components within deep networks. This paper surveys the evolution and current state of this approach, from early implementations limited to quadratic programming, to more recent frameworks supporting general convex optimization problems. We provide a comprehensive review of the background, theoretical foundations, and emerging applications of this technology. Our analysis includes detailed mathematical proofs and an examination of various use cases that demonstrate the potential of this hybrid approach. This work synthesizes developments at the intersection of optimization theory and deep learning, offering insights into both current capabilities and future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.</p></details> |  |

We make the first attempt and propose a self-supervised pretraining framework to learn fundamental representations of real face images, FSFM, that leverages the synergy between masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID). We explore various facial masking strategies for MIM and present a simple yet powerful CRFR-P masking, which explicitly forces the model to capture meaningful intra-region consistency and challenging inter-region coherency. Furthermore, we devise the ID network that naturally couples with MIM to establish underlying local-to-global correspondence via tailored self-distillation. These three learning objectives, namely 3C, empower encoding both local features and global semantics of real faces. After pretraining, a vanilla ViT serves as a universal vision foundation model for downstream face security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection, cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forgery detection. Extensive experiments on 10 public datasets demonstrate that our model transfers better than supervised pretraining, visual and facial self-supervised learning arts, and even outperforms task-specialized SOTA methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 11 figures, project page: https://fsfm-3c.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Time-Series Foundation Model for Value-at-Risk Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11773v5)** | 2024-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study is the first to explore the performance of a time-series foundation model for Value-at-Risk (VaR) forecasting. Foundation models, pre-trained on vast and varied datasets, can be used in a zero-shot setting with relatively minimal data or further improved through finetuning. We compare the performance of Google's model, called TimesFM, against conventional parametric and non-parametric models, including GARCH, Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS), and empirical quantile estimates, using daily returns from the S\&P 100 index and its constituents over 19 years. Our backtesting results indicate that in terms of the actual-over-expected ratio, the fine-tuned TimesFM model consistently outperforms traditional methods. Regarding the quantile score loss function, it achieves performance comparable to the best econometric approach, the GAS model. Overall, the foundation model is either the best or among the top performers in forecasting VaR across the 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 VaR levels. Fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy, indicating that zero-shot use is not optimal for VaR forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[General Geospatial Inference with a Population Dynamics Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07207v3)** | 2024-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supporting the health and well-being of dynamic populations around the world requires governmental agencies, organizations and researchers to understand and reason over complex relationships between human behavior and local contexts in order to identify high-risk groups and strategically allocate limited resources. Traditional approaches to these classes of problems often entail developing manually curated, task-specific features and models to represent human behavior and the natural and built environment, which can be challenging to adapt to new, or even, related tasks. To address this, we introduce a Population Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM) that aims to capture the relationships between diverse data modalities and is applicable to a broad range of geospatial tasks. We first construct a geo-indexed dataset for postal codes and counties across the United States, capturing rich aggregated information on human behavior from maps, busyness, and aggregated search trends, and environmental factors such as weather and air quality. We then model this data and the complex relationships between locations using a graph neural network, producing embeddings that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks using relatively simple models. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by benchmarking it on 27 downstream tasks spanning three distinct domains: health indicators, socioeconomic factors, and environmental measurements. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 27 geospatial interpolation tasks, and on 25 out of the 27 extrapolation and super-resolution tasks. We combined the PDFM with a state-of-the-art forecasting foundation model, TimesFM, to predict unemployment and poverty, achieving performance that surpasses fully supervised forecasting. The full set of embeddings and sample code are publicly available for researchers.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 16 figures, preprint; v3: updated affiliations</p></details> |

We investigate nine foundational models, focusing on their responses to viewpoint changes, including the often-overlooked accidental viewpoints where specific camera orientations obscure an object's true 3D structure. Our methodology enables recognizing and classifying out-of-distribution (OOD), accidental, and stable viewpoints using feature representations alone, without accessing the actual images. Our findings indicate that while foundation models consistently encode accidental viewpoints, they vary in their interpretation of OOD viewpoints due to inherent biases, at times leading to object misclassifications based on geometric resemblance. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations on three downstream tasks - classification, VQA, and 3D reconstruction - we illustrate the impact of viewpoint instability and underscore the importance of feature robustness across diverse viewing conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages + 3 pages of references. 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, their application in anomaly detection and prediction remains underexplored, with growing concerns regarding their black-box nature, lack of interpretability and applicability. This paper critically evaluates the efficacy of TSFM in anomaly detection and prediction tasks. We systematically analyze TSFM across multiple datasets, including those characterized by the absence of discernible patterns, trends and seasonality. Our analysis shows that while TSFMs can be extended for anomaly detection and prediction, traditional statistical and deep learning models often match or outperform TSFM in these tasks. Additionally, TSFMs require high computational resources but fail to capture sequential dependencies effectively or improve performance in few-shot or zero-shot scenarios. \noindent The preprocessed datasets, codes to reproduce the results and supplementary materials are available at https://github.com/smtmnfg/TSFM.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables.

Owing to its vast volume, diverse sources, and temporal properties, RS data is highly suitable for the development of large Visual Foundation Models (VFMs). VFMs act as robust feature extractors, learning from extensive RS data, and are subsequently fine-tuned for deployment in various geoscientific tasks. However, current VFMs in the RS domain are predominantly pretrained and tailored exclusively for specific characteristics of RS imagery, neglecting the potential of utilizing the multi-dimensional properties of RS data. Therefore, in this work, we propose SeaMo, a pioneering visual foundation model that integrates multi-seasonal and multimodal information in the RS field. SeaMo is designed to harness multiple properties of RS data. Within the masked image modeling framework, we employ non-aligned cropping techniques to extract spatial properties, use multi-source inputs for multimodal integration, and incorporate temporal-multimodal fusion blocks for effective assimilation of multi-seasonal data. SeaMo explicitly models the multi-dimensional properties of RS data, making the model more comprehensive, robust, and versatile. We applied SeaMo to several downstream geoscience tasks, which demonstrated exceptional performance. Extensive ablation studies were conducted to validate the model's superiority.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes novel structured speaker-deficiency adaptation approaches for SSL pre-trained SFMs on such data. Speaker and speech deficiency invariant SFMs were constructed in their supervised adaptive fine-tuning stage to reduce undue bias to training data speakers, and serves as a more neutral and robust starting point for test time unsupervised adaptation. Speech variability attributed to speaker identity and speech impairment severity, or aging induced neurocognitive decline, are modelled using separate adapters that can be combined together to model any seen or unseen speaker. Experiments on the UASpeech dysarthric and DementiaBank Pitt elderly speech corpora suggest structured speaker-deficiency adaptation of HuBERT and Wav2vec2-conformer models consistently outperforms baseline SFMs using either: a) no adapters; b) global adapters shared among all speakers; or c) single attribute adapters modelling speaker or deficiency labels alone by statistically significant WER reductions up to 3.01% and 1.50% absolute (10.86% and 6.94% relative) on the two tasks respectively. The lowest published WER of 19.45% (49.34% on very low intelligibility, 33.17% on unseen words) is obtained on the UASpeech test set of 16 dysarthric speakers.</p></details> |  |

We introduce XRAG, an open-source, modular codebase that facilitates exhaustive evaluation of the performance of foundational components of advanced RAG modules. These components are systematically categorized into four core phases: pre-retrieval, retrieval, post-retrieval, and generation. We systematically analyse them across reconfigured datasets, providing a comprehensive benchmark for their effectiveness. As the complexity of RAG systems continues to escalate, we underscore the critical need to identify potential failure points in RAG systems. We formulate a suite of experimental methodologies and diagnostic testing protocols to dissect the failure points inherent in RAG engineering. Subsequently, we proffer bespoke solutions aimed at bolstering the overall performance of these modules. Our work thoroughly evaluates the performance of advanced core components in RAG systems, providing insights into optimizations for prevalent failure points.</p></details> |  |

However, their effectiveness in large-scale outdoor datasets remains constrained by the scarcity of accurate supervision signals, the extensive noise caused by variable outdoor conditions, and the abundance of unknown objects. In this work, we propose a novel label-free learning method, Adaptive Label Correction (AdaCo), for 3D semantic segmentation. AdaCo first introduces the Cross-modal Label Generation Module (CLGM), providing cross-modal supervision with the formidable interpretive capabilities of the VFMs. Subsequently, AdaCo incorporates the Adaptive Noise Corrector (ANC), updating and adjusting the noisy samples within this supervision iteratively during training. Moreover, we develop an Adaptive Robust Loss (ARL) function to modulate each sample's sensitivity to noisy supervision, preventing potential underfitting issues associated with robust loss. Our proposed AdaCo can effectively mitigate the performance limitations of label-free learning networks in 3D semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments on two outdoor benchmark datasets highlight the superior performance of our method.</p></details> | 2025 AAAI |

In the typical FL paradigm (e.g., FedAvg), model weights are sent to and from the server each round to participating clients. Recently, the use of small pre-trained models has been shown to be effective in federated learning optimization and improving convergence. However, recent state-of-the-art pre-trained models are getting more capable but also have more parameters, known as the "Foundation Models." In conventional FL, sharing the enormous model weights can quickly put a massive communication burden on the system, especially if more capable models are employed. Can we find a solution to enable those strong and readily available pre-trained models in FL to achieve excellent performance while simultaneously reducing the communication burden? To this end, we investigate the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning in federated learning and thus introduce a new framework: FedPEFT. Specifically, we systemically evaluate the performance of FedPEFT across a variety of client stability, data distribution, and differential privacy settings. By only locally tuning and globally sharing a small portion of the model weights, significant reductions in the total communication overhead can be achieved while maintaining competitive or even better performance in a wide range of federated learning scenarios, providing insight into a new paradigm for practical and effective federated systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2024 IEEE International Conference on Big Data</p></details> |

Given the complexities of these high-dimensional models, traditional techniques for constraining agent behavior, which typically rely on low-dimensional, discrete state and action spaces, cannot be directly applied. Drawing inspiration from robotic action selection techniques, we propose the grounded observer framework for constraining foundation model behavior that offers both behavioral guarantees and real-time variability. This method leverages real-time assessment of low-level behavioral characteristics to dynamically adjust model actions and provide contextual feedback. To demonstrate this, we develop a system capable of sustaining contextually appropriate, casual conversations ("small talk"), which we then apply to a robot for novel, unscripted interactions with humans. Finally, we discuss potential applications of the framework for other social contexts and areas for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2412.18023</p></details> |

Artificial Life (ALife) has not yet integrated FMs, thus presenting a major opportunity for the field to alleviate the historical burden of relying chiefly on manual design and trial-and-error to discover the configurations of lifelike simulations. This paper presents, for the first time, a successful realization of this opportunity using vision-language FMs. The proposed approach, called Automated Search for Artificial Life (ASAL), (1) finds simulations that produce target phenomena, (2) discovers simulations that generate temporally open-ended novelty, and (3) illuminates an entire space of interestingly diverse simulations. Because of the generality of FMs, ASAL works effectively across a diverse range of ALife substrates including Boids, Particle Life, Game of Life, Lenia, and Neural Cellular Automata. A major result highlighting the potential of this technique is the discovery of previously unseen Lenia and Boids lifeforms, as well as cellular automata that are open-ended like Conway's Game of Life. Additionally, the use of FMs allows for the quantification of previously qualitative phenomena in a human-aligned way. This new paradigm promises to accelerate ALife research beyond what is possible through human ingenuity alone.</p></details> | 27 pages, 17 figures |

We evaluate pretrained models on downstream tasks for varying amounts of training samples and choices of pretraining datasets. Our preliminary results indicate that embeddings from pretrained models improve generalization only with enough downstream data points and in a degree which depends on the quantity and properties of pretraining data.

However, existing FMs still perform poorly in the energy fields, such as building energy forecasting (BEF). This paper studies the adaptation of FM to BEF tasks. We demonstrate the shortcomings of fine-tuning FM straightforwardly from both the perspectives of FM and the data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new \textit{contrastive curriculum learning}-based training method. Our method optimizes the ordering of training data in the context of TSFM adaptation. Experiments show that our method can improve the zero/few-shot performance by 14.6\% compared to the existing FMs. Our code and new TSFM will be available at <Anonymous Github Repo>.</p></details> |  |

The VAE framework uses hyper-priors to model latent space dependencies, enhancing compression efficiency. The SR module refines low-resolution representations into high-resolution outputs, improving reconstruction quality. By alternating between 2D and 3D convolutions, the model efficiently captures spatiotemporal correlations in scientific data while maintaining low computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that the FM generalizes well to unseen domains and varying data shapes, achieving up to 4 times higher compression ratios than state-of-the-art methods after domain-specific fine-tuning. The SR module improves compression ratio by 30 percent compared to simple upsampling techniques. This approach significantly reduces storage and transmission costs for large-scale scientific simulations while preserving data integrity and fidelity.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies on foundation model-based recommendation have emphasized the Transformer architecture's remarkable ability to capture complex, non-linear user-item interaction relationships. This paper aims to advance foundation model-based recommendersystems by introducing enhancements to multifaceted user modeling capabilities. We propose a novel Transformer layer designed specifically for recommendation, using the self-attention mechanism to capture sequential user-item interaction patterns. Specifically, we design a group gating network to identify user groups, enabling hierarchical discovery across different layers, thereby capturing the multifaceted nature of user interests through multiple Transformer layers. Furthermore, to broaden the data scope and further enhance multifaceted user modeling, we extend the framework to a federated setting, enabling the use of private datasets while ensuring privacy.

In this paper, we instead propose and study a more challenging type of retrieval task, called hidden rationale retrieval, in which query and document are not similar but can be inferred by reasoning chains, logic relationships, or empirical experiences. To address such problems, an instruction-tuned Large language model (LLM) with a cross-encoder architecture could be a reasonable choice. To further strengthen pioneering LLM-based retrievers, we design a special instruction that transforms the retrieval task into a generative task by prompting LLM to answer a binary-choice question. The model can be fine-tuned with direct preference optimization (DPO). The framework is also optimized for computational efficiency with no performance degradation. We name this retrieval framework by RaHoRe and verify its zero-shot and fine-tuned performance superiority on Emotional Support Conversation (ESC), compared with previous retrieval works. Our study suggests the potential to employ LLM as a foundation for a wider scope of retrieval tasks.

However, model capability breaks down in very specific tasks, such as the classification of "Gutachtenstil" appraisal style components, or with complex contexts, such as complete legal opinions. Even with extended context and effective prompting strategies, they cannot match the Bag-of-Words baseline. To combat this, we introduce a Retrieval Augmented Generation based prompt example selection method that substantially improves predictions in high data availability scenarios. We further evaluate the performance of pre-trained LLMs on two standard tasks for argument mining and automated essay scoring and find it to be more adequate. Throughout, pre-trained LLMs improve upon the baseline in scenarios with little or no labeled data with Chain-of-Thought prompting further helping in the zero-shot case.</p></details> | 11 pages |

However, the use of logic in the context of both human and machine reasoning is typically through the dual 'reductive' perspective: collections of sufficient premisses are generated from putative conclusions. We call this paradigm, 'reductive logic'. This expression of logic encompass as diverse reasoning activities as proving a formula in a formal system to seeking to meet a friend before noon on Saturday. This paper is a semantical analysis of reductive logic. In particular, we provide mathematical foundations for representing and reasoning about 'reduction operators'. Heuristically, reduction operators may be thought of as `backwards' inference rules. In this paper, we address their mathematical representation, how they are used in the context of reductive reasoning, and, crucially, what makes them 'valid'.</p></details> |  |

First, we prove the availability of rotary position embedding in the state space duality algorithm, which reduces the perplexity of the hybrid quadratic causal self-attention and state space duality by more than 4%, to ensure that the combining sequence transformation unifies position encoding. Second, we propose dynamic mask attention, which maintains 100% accuracy in the more challenging multi-query associative recall task, improving by more than 150% compared to quadratic causal self-attention and state space duality, to ensure that the combining sequence transformation selectively filters relevant information. Third, we design cross domain mixture of experts, which makes the computational speed of expert retrieval with more than 1024 experts 8 to 10 times faster than the mixture of experts, to ensure that the combining state transformation quickly retrieval mixture.

This paper studies the challenging CL setting of class-incremental learning (CIL). CIL has two key challenges: catastrophic forgetting (CF) and inter-task class separation (ICS). Despite numerous proposed methods, these issues remain persistent obstacles. This paper proposes a novel CIL method, called Kernel Linear Discriminant Analysis (KLDA), that can effectively avoid CF and ICS problems. It leverages only the powerful features learned in a foundation model (FM). However, directly using these features proves suboptimal. To address this, KLDA incorporates the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel and its Random Fourier Features (RFF) to enhance the feature representations from the FM, leading to improved performance. When a new task arrives, KLDA computes only the mean for each class in the task and updates a shared covariance matrix for all learned classes based on the kernelized features. Classification is performed using Linear Discriminant Analysis. Our empirical evaluation using text and image classification datasets demonstrates that KLDA significantly outperforms baselines. Remarkably, without relying on replay data, KLDA achieves accuracy comparable to joint training of all classes, which is considered the upper bound for CIL performance. The KLDA code is available at https://github.com/salehmomeni/klda.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards scientific discovery with dictionary learning: Extracting biological concepts from microscopy foundation models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16247v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dictionary learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful interpretability tool for large language models. By extracting known concepts (e.g., Golden-Gate Bridge) from human-interpretable data (e.g., text), sparse DL can elucidate a model's inner workings. In this work, we ask if DL can also be used to discover unknown concepts from less human-interpretable scientific data (e.g., cell images), ultimately enabling modern approaches to scientific discovery. As a first step, we use DL algorithms to study microscopy foundation models trained on multi-cell image data, where little prior knowledge exists regarding which high-level concepts should arise. We show that sparse dictionaries indeed extract biologically-meaningful concepts such as cell type and genetic perturbation type. We also propose a new DL algorithm, Iterative Codebook Feature Learning~(ICFL), and combine it with a pre-processing step that uses PCA whitening from a control dataset. In our experiments, we demonstrate that both ICFL and PCA improve the selectivity of extracted features compared to TopK sparse autoencoders.</p></details> |  |

However, their open nature also makes them vulnerable to exploitation by malicious actors, including state-sponsored entities, who can conduct information operations (IOs) to manipulate public opinion. The spread of misinformation, false news, and misleading claims threatens democratic processes and societal cohesion, making it crucial to develop methods for the timely detection of inauthentic activity to protect the integrity of online discourse. In this work, we introduce a methodology designed to identify users orchestrating information operations, a.k.a. \textit{IO drivers}, across various influence campaigns. Our framework, named \texttt{IOHunter}, leverages the combined strengths of Language Models and Graph Neural Networks to improve generalization in \emph{supervised}, \emph{scarcely-supervised}, and \emph{cross-IO} contexts. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple sets of IOs originating from six countries, significantly surpassing existing approaches. This research marks a step toward developing Graph Foundation Models specifically tailored for the task of IO detection on social media platforms.</p></details> | 9 pages |

The powerful yet incomplete nature of these models has spurred a wide range of mechanisms to augment them with capabilities such as in-context learning, information retrieval, and code interpreting. We propose Vieira, a declarative framework that unifies these mechanisms in a general solution for programming with foundation models. Vieira follows a probabilistic relational paradigm and treats foundation models as stateless functions with relational inputs and outputs. It supports neuro-symbolic applications by enabling the seamless combination of such models with logic programs, as well as complex, multi-modal applications by streamlining the composition of diverse sub-models. We implement Vieira by extending the Scallop compiler with a foreign interface that supports foundation models as plugins. We implement plugins for 12 foundation models including GPT, CLIP, and SAM. We evaluate Vieira on 9 challenging tasks that span language, vision, and structured and vector databases. Our evaluation shows that programs in Vieira are concise, can incorporate modern foundation models, and have comparable or better accuracy than competitive baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Vision-Language Foundation Model to Enhance Efficiency of Chest X-ray Interpretation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12208v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over 1.4 billion chest X-rays (CXRs) are performed annually due to their cost-effectiveness as an initial diagnostic test. This scale of radiological studies provides a significant opportunity to streamline CXR interpretation and documentation. While foundation models are a promising solution, the lack of publicly available large-scale datasets and benchmarks inhibits their iterative development and real-world evaluation. To overcome these challenges, we constructed a large-scale dataset (CheXinstruct), which we utilized to train a vision-language foundation model (CheXagent). We systematically demonstrated competitive performance across eight distinct task types on our novel evaluation benchmark (CheXbench). Beyond technical validation, we assessed the real-world utility of CheXagent in directly drafting radiology reports. Our clinical assessment with eight radiologists revealed a 36% time saving for residents using CheXagent-drafted reports, while attending radiologists showed no significant time difference editing resident-drafted or CheXagent-drafted reports. The CheXagent-drafted reports improved the writing efficiency of both radiology residents and attending radiologists in 81% and 61% of cases, respectively, without loss of quality. Overall, we demonstrate that CheXagent can effectively perform a variety of CXR interpretation tasks and holds potential to assist radiologists in routine clinical workflows.</p></details> | 26 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Foundation Models Meet Low-Cost Sensors: Test-Time Adaptation for Rescaling Disparity for Zero-Shot Metric Depth Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14103v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development of foundation models for monocular depth estimation such as Depth Anything paved the way to zero-shot monocular depth estimation. Since it returns an affine-invariant disparity map, the favored technique to recover the metric depth consists in fine-tuning the model. However, this stage is costly to perform because of the training but also due to the creation of the dataset. It must contain images captured by the camera that will be used at test time and the corresponding ground truth. Moreover, the fine-tuning may also degrade the generalizing capacity of the original model. Instead, we propose in this paper a new method to rescale Depth Anything predictions using 3D points provided by low-cost sensors or techniques such as low-resolution LiDAR, stereo camera, structure-from-motion where poses are given by an IMU. Thus, this approach avoids fine-tuning and preserves the generalizing power of the original depth estimation model while being robust to the noise of the sensor or of the depth model. Our experiments highlight improvements relative to other metric depth estimation methods and competitive results compared to fine-tuned approaches.

| **[Adaptive Concept Bottleneck for Foundation Models Under Distribution Shifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14097v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in foundation models (FMs) have led to a paradigm shift in machine learning. The rich, expressive feature representations from these pre-trained, large-scale FMs are leveraged for multiple downstream tasks, usually via lightweight fine-tuning of a shallow fully-connected network following the representation. However, the non-interpretable, black-box nature of this prediction pipeline can be a challenge, especially in critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and security. In this paper, we explore the potential of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) for transforming complex, non-interpretable foundation models into interpretable decision-making pipelines using high-level concept vectors. Specifically, we focus on the test-time deployment of such an interpretable CBM pipeline "in the wild", where the input distribution often shifts from the original training distribution. We first identify the potential failure modes of such a pipeline under different types of distribution shifts. Then we propose an adaptive concept bottleneck framework to address these failure modes, that dynamically adapts the concept-vector bank and the prediction layer based solely on unlabeled data from the target domain, without access to the source (training) dataset. Empirical evaluations with various real-world distribution shifts show that our adaptation method produces concept-based interpretations better aligned with the test data and boosts post-deployment accuracy by up to 28%, aligning the CBM performance with that of non-interpretable classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The preliminary version of the work appeared in the ICML 2024 Workshop on Foundation Models in the Wild</p></details> |
| **[Data-Efficient Inference of Neural Fluid Fields via SciML Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13897v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in 3D vision have enabled successful progress in inferring neural fluid fields and realistic rendering of fluid dynamics. However, these methods require real-world flow captures, which demand dense video sequences and specialized lab setups, making the process costly and challenging. Scientific machine learning (SciML) foundation models, which are pretrained on extensive simulations of partial differential equations (PDEs), encode rich multiphysics knowledge and thus provide promising sources of domain priors for inferring fluid fields. Nevertheless, their potential to advance real-world vision problems remains largely underexplored, raising questions about the transferability and practical utility of these foundation models. In this work, we demonstrate that SciML foundation model can significantly improve the data efficiency of inferring real-world 3D fluid dynamics with improved generalization. At the core of our method is leveraging the strong forecasting capabilities and meaningful representations of SciML foundation models. We equip neural fluid fields with a novel collaborative training approach that utilizes augmented views and fluid features extracted by our foundation model. Our method demonstrates significant improvements in both quantitative metrics and visual quality, showcasing the practical applicability of SciML foundation models in real-world fluid dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analyzing Toxicity in Open Source Software Communications Using Psycholinguistics and Moral Foundations Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13133v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Studies have shown that toxic behavior can cause contributors to leave, and hinder newcomers' (especially from underrepresented communities) participation in Open Source Software (OSS) projects. Thus, detection of toxic language plays a crucial role in OSS collaboration and inclusivity. Off-the-shelf toxicity detectors are ineffective when applied to OSS communications, due to the distinct nature of toxicity observed in these channels (e.g., entitlement and arrogance are more frequently observed on GitHub than on Reddit or Twitter). In this paper, we investigate a machine learning-based approach for the automatic detection of toxic communications in OSS. We leverage psycholinguistic lexicons, and Moral Foundations Theory to analyze toxicity in two types of OSS communication channels; issue comments and code reviews. Our evaluation indicates that our approach can achieve a significant performance improvement (up to 7% increase in F1 score) over the existing domain-specific toxicity detector. We found that using moral values as features is more effective than linguistic cues, resulting in 67.50% F1-measure in identifying toxic instances in code review data and 64.83% in issue comments. While the detection accuracy is far from accurate, this improvement demonstrates the potential of integrating moral and psycholinguistic features in toxicity detection models. These findings highlight the importance of context-specific models that consider the unique communication styles within OSS, where interpersonal and value-driven language dynamics differ markedly from general social media platforms. Future work could focus on refining these models to further enhance detection accuracy, possibly by incorporating community-specific norms and conversational context to better capture the nuanced expressions of toxicity in OSS environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundations of the Theory of Performance-Based Ranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04227v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ranking entities such as algorithms, devices, methods, or models based on their performances, while accounting for application-specific preferences, is a challenge. To address this challenge, we establish the foundations of a universal theory for performance-based ranking. First, we introduce a rigorous framework built on top of both the probability and order theories. Our new framework encompasses the elements necessary to (1) manipulate performances as mathematical objects, (2) express which performances are worse than or equivalent to others, (3) model tasks through a variable called satisfaction, (4) consider properties of the evaluation, (5) define scores, and (6) specify application-specific preferences through a variable called importance. On top of this framework, we propose the first axiomatic definition of performance orderings and performance-based rankings. Then, we introduce a universal parametric family of scores, called ranking scores, that can be used to establish rankings satisfying our axioms, while considering application-specific preferences. Finally, we show, in the case of two-class classification, that the family of ranking scores encompasses well-known performance scores, including the accuracy, the true positive rate (recall, sensitivity), the true negative rate (specificity), the positive predictive value (precision), and F1. However, we also show that some other scores commonly used to compare classifiers are unsuitable to derive performance orderings satisfying the axioms. Therefore, this paper provides the computer vision and machine learning communities with a rigorous framework for evaluating and ranking entities.</p></details> |  |
| **[SARATR-X: Towards Building A Foundation Model for SAR Target Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09365v3)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable progress in synthetic aperture radar automatic target recognition (SAR ATR), recent efforts have concentrated on detecting and classifying a specific category, e.g., vehicles, ships, airplanes, or buildings. One of the fundamental limitations of the top-performing SAR ATR methods is that the learning paradigm is supervised, task-specific, limited-category, closed-world learning, which depends on massive amounts of accurately annotated samples that are expensively labeled by expert SAR analysts and have limited generalization capability and scalability. In this work, we make the first attempt towards building a foundation model for SAR ATR, termed SARATR-X. SARATR-X learns generalizable representations via self-supervised learning (SSL) and provides a cornerstone for label-efficient model adaptation to generic SAR target detection and classification tasks. Specifically, SARATR-X is trained on 0.18 M unlabelled SAR target samples, which are curated by combining contemporary benchmarks and constitute the largest publicly available dataset till now. Considering the characteristics of SAR images, a backbone tailored for SAR ATR is carefully designed, and a two-step SSL method endowed with multi-scale gradient features was applied to ensure the feature diversity and model scalability of SARATR-X. The capabilities of SARATR-X are evaluated on classification under few-shot and robustness settings and detection across various categories and scenes, and impressive performance is achieved, often competitive with or even superior to prior fully supervised, semi-supervised, or self-supervised algorithms. Our SARATR-X and the curated dataset are released at https://github.com/waterdisappear/SARATR-X to foster research into foundation models for SAR image interpretation.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Efficient Transfer Learning for Video-language Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11223v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models provide a robust foundation for efficient transfer learning across various downstream tasks. In the field of video action recognition, mainstream approaches often introduce additional parameter modules to capture temporal information. While the increased model capacity brought by these additional parameters helps better fit the video-specific inductive biases, existing methods require learning a large number of parameters and are prone to catastrophic forgetting of the original generalizable knowledge. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Multi-modal Spatio-Temporal Adapter (MSTA) to improve the alignment between representations in the text and vision branches, achieving a balance between general knowledge and task-specific knowledge. Furthermore, to mitigate over-fitting and enhance generalizability, we introduce a spatio-temporal description-guided consistency constraint. This constraint involves feeding template inputs (i.e., ``a video of $\{\textbf{cls}\}$'') into the trainable language branch, while LLM-generated spatio-temporal descriptions are input into the pre-trained language branch, enforcing consistency between the outputs of the two branches. This mechanism prevents over-fitting to downstream tasks and improves the distinguishability of the trainable branch within the spatio-temporal semantic space. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach across four tasks: zero-shot transfer, few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and fully-supervised learning. Compared to many state-of-the-art methods, our MSTA achieves outstanding performance across all evaluations, while using only 2-7\% of the trainable parameters in the original model. Code will be avaliable at https://github.com/chenhaoxing/ETL4Video.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Fine-Tuning of Single-Cell Foundation Models Enables Zero-Shot Molecular Perturbation Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13478v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting transcriptional responses to novel drugs provides a unique opportunity to accelerate biomedical research and advance drug discovery efforts. However, the inherent complexity and high dimensionality of cellular responses, combined with the extremely limited available experimental data, makes the task challenging. In this study, we leverage single-cell foundation models (FMs) pre-trained on tens of millions of single cells, encompassing multiple cell types, states, and disease annotations, to address molecular perturbation prediction. We introduce a drug-conditional adapter that allows efficient fine-tuning by training less than 1% of the original foundation model, thus enabling molecular conditioning while preserving the rich biological representation learned during pre-training. The proposed strategy allows not only the prediction of cellular responses to novel drugs, but also the zero-shot generalization to unseen cell lines. We establish a robust evaluation framework to assess model performance across different generalization tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art results across all settings, with significant improvements in the few-shot and zero-shot generalization to new cell lines compared to existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

To achieve high reliability and scalability in deploying these agent services, it is essential to collaboratively optimize computational and communication resources, thereby ensuring effective resource allocation and seamless service delivery. In pursuit of this vision, this paper proposes a unified framework aimed at providing a comprehensive survey on deploying FM-based agent services across heterogeneous devices, with the emphasis on the integration of model and resource optimization to establish a robust infrastructure for these services. Particularly, this paper begins with exploring various low-level optimization strategies during inference and studies approaches that enhance system scalability, such as parallelism techniques and resource scaling methods. The paper then discusses several prominent FMs and investigates research efforts focused on inference acceleration, including techniques such as model compression and token reduction. Moreover, the paper also investigates critical components for constructing agent services and highlights notable intelligent applications. Finally, the paper presents potential research directions for developing real-time agent services with high Quality of Service (QoS).</p></details> |  |

OCTCube-M first developed OCTCube, a 3D foundation model pre-trained on 26,685 3D OCT volumes encompassing 1.62 million 2D OCT images. It then exploits a novel multi-modal contrastive learning framework COEP to integrate other retinal imaging modalities, such as fundus autofluorescence and infrared retinal imaging, into OCTCube, efficiently extending it into multi-modal foundation models. OCTCube achieves best performance on predicting 8 retinal diseases, demonstrating strong generalizability on cross-cohort, cross-device and cross-modality prediction. OCTCube can also predict cross-organ nodule malignancy (CT) and low cardiac ejection fraction as well as systemic diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension, revealing its wide applicability beyond retinal diseases. We further develop OCTCube-IR using COEP with 26,685 OCT and IR image pairs. OCTCube-IR can accurately retrieve between OCT and IR images, allowing joint analysis between 3D and 2D retinal imaging modalities. Finally, we trained a tri-modal foundation model OCTCube-EF from 4 million 2D OCT images and 400K en face retinal images. OCTCube-EF attains the best performance on predicting the growth rate of geographic atrophy (GA) across datasets collected from 6 multi-center global trials conducted in 23 countries. This improvement is statistically equivalent to running a clinical trial with more than double the size of the original study. Our analysis based on another retrospective case study reveals OCTCube-EF's ability to avoid false positive Phase-III results according to its accurate treatment effect estimation on the Phase-II results. In sum, OCTCube-M is a 3D multi-modal foundation model framework that integrates OCT and other retinal imaging modalities revealing substantial diagnostic and prognostic benefits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proposer-Agent-Evaluator(PAE): Autonomous Skill Discovery For Foundation Model Internet Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13194v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vision of a broadly capable and goal-directed agent, such as an Internet-browsing agent in the digital world and a household humanoid in the physical world, has rapidly advanced, thanks to the generalization capability of foundation models. Such a generalist agent needs to have a large and diverse skill repertoire, such as finding directions between two travel locations and buying specific items from the Internet. If each skill needs to be specified manually through a fixed set of human-annotated instructions, the agent's skill repertoire will necessarily be limited due to the quantity and diversity of human-annotated instructions. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing Proposer-Agent-Evaluator, an effective learning system that enables foundation model agents to autonomously discover and practice skills in the wild. At the heart of PAE is a context-aware task proposer that autonomously proposes tasks for the agent to practice with context information of the environment such as user demos or even just the name of the website itself for Internet-browsing agents. Then, the agent policy attempts those tasks with thoughts and actual grounded operations in the real world with resulting trajectories evaluated by an autonomous VLM-based success evaluator. The success evaluation serves as the reward signal for the agent to refine its policies through RL. We validate PAE on challenging vision-based web navigation, using both real-world and self-hosted websites from WebVoyager and WebArena.To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first effective learning system to apply autonomous task proposal with RL for agents that generalizes real-world human-annotated benchmarks with SOTA performances. Our open-source checkpoints and code can be found in https://yanqval.github.io/PAE/</p></details> |  |

However, prevalent approaches primarily rely on extensive labeled data and computationally intensive voxel-based modeling, restricting the scalability and generalizability of 3D representation learning. In this paper, we introduce GaussTR, a novel Gaussian Transformer that leverages alignment with foundation models to advance self-supervised 3D spatial understanding. GaussTR adopts a Transformer architecture to predict sparse sets of 3D Gaussians that represent scenes in a feed-forward manner. Through aligning rendered Gaussian features with diverse knowledge from pre-trained foundation models, GaussTR facilitates the learning of versatile 3D representations and enables open-vocabulary occupancy prediction without explicit annotations. Empirical evaluations on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset showcase GaussTR's state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, achieving 11.70 mIoU while reducing training duration by approximately 50%. These experimental results highlight the significant potential of GaussTR for scalable and holistic 3D spatial understanding, with promising implications for autonomous driving and embodied agents.

The learnable distance measure captures motif similarity and domain-specific semantic information such as rotation invariance. The learned distance provides a measurement of semantic similarity between a pair of accelerometer time-series segments, which is used to measure the distance between an anchor and various other sampled candidate segments. The self-supervised model is trained on 1 billion segments from 87,376 participants from a large wearables dataset. The model achieves strong performance across multiple downstream tasks, encompassing both classification and regression. To our knowledge, we are the first to show the generalizability of a self-supervised learning model with motion data from wearables across distinct evaluation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Among these models, vision-language pre-training, which leverages large-scale paired data to align pathology image and text embedding spaces, and provides a novel zero-shot paradigm for downstream tasks. However, existing models have been primarily data-driven and lack the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge, which limits their performance in cancer diagnosis, especially for rare tumor subtypes. To address this limitation, we establish a Knowledge-enhanced Pathology (KEEP) foundation model that harnesses disease knowledge to facilitate vision-language pre-training. Specifically, we first construct a disease knowledge graph (KG) that covers 11,454 human diseases with 139,143 disease attributes, including synonyms, definitions, and hypernym relations. We then systematically reorganize the millions of publicly available noisy pathology image-text pairs, into 143K well-structured semantic groups linked through the hierarchical relations of the disease KG. To derive more nuanced image and text representations, we propose a novel knowledge-enhanced vision-language pre-training approach that integrates disease knowledge into the alignment within hierarchical semantic groups instead of unstructured image-text pairs. Validated on 18 diverse benchmarks with more than 14,000 whole slide images (WSIs), KEEP achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot cancer diagnostic tasks. Notably, for cancer detection, KEEP demonstrates an average sensitivity of 89.8% at a specificity of 95.0% across 7 cancer types. For cancer subtyping, KEEP achieves a median balanced accuracy of 0.456 in subtyping 30 rare brain cancers, indicating strong generalizability for diagnosing rare tumors.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we explore the feasibility of foundation models for applications in the control domain. The success of these models is enabled by large-scale pretaining on Internet-scale datasets. These are available in fields like natural language processing and computer vision, but do not exist for dynamical systems. We address this challenge by pretraining a transformer-based foundation model exclusively on synthetic data and propose to sample dynamics functions from a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Our pretrained model generalizes for prediction tasks across different dynamical systems, which we validate in simulation and hardware experiments, including cart-pole and Furuta pendulum setups. Additionally, the model can be fine-tuned effectively to new systems to increase performance even further. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of foundation models for dynamical systems that outperform specialist models in terms of generalization, data efficiency, and robustness.</p></details> | 10 pages |

In this study, we evaluate the zero-shot prediction capabilities of five Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs)-a new approach for STLP where models perform predictions without task-specific training-against two classical models, Gaussian Process (GP) and Support Vector Regression (SVR), which are trained on task-specific datasets. Our findings indicate that even without training, TSFMs like Chronos, TimesFM, and TimeGPT can surpass the performance of GP and SVR. This finding highlights the potential of TSFMs in STLP.</p></details> |  |

In this proposal, we demonstrate that indeed ChatGPT can assist in data cleaning by suggesting corrections for specific cells in a data table (scenario 1). However, ChatGPT may struggle with datasets it has never encountered before (e.g., local enterprise data) or when the user requires an explanation of the source of the suggested clean values. To address these issues, we developed a retrieval-based method that complements ChatGPT's power with a user-provided data lake. The data lake is first indexed, we then retrieve the top-k relevant tuples to the user's query tuple and finally leverage ChatGPT to infer the correct value (scenario 2). Nevertheless, sharing enterprise data with ChatGPT, an externally hosted model, might not be feasible for privacy reasons. To assist with this scenario, we developed a custom RoBERTa-based foundation model that can be locally deployed. By fine-tuning it on a small number of examples, it can effectively make value inferences based on the retrieved tuples (scenario 3). Our proposed system, RetClean, seamlessly supports all three scenarios and provides a user-friendly GUI that enables the VLDB audience to explore and experiment with the system.</p></details> |  |

However, automating LULC map generation using machine learning is rendered challenging due to noisy labels. Typically, the ground truths (e.g. ESRI LULC, MapBioMass) have noisy labels that hamper the model's ability to learn to accurately classify the pixels. Further, these erroneous labels can significantly distort the performance metrics of a model, leading to misleading evaluations. Traditionally, the ambiguous labels are rectified using unsupervised algorithms. These algorithms struggle not only with scalability but also with generalization across different geographies. To overcome these challenges, we propose a zero-shot approach using the foundation model, Segment Anything Model (SAM), to automatically delineate different land parcels/regions and leverage them to relabel the unsure pixels by using the local label statistics within each detected region. We achieve a significant reduction in label noise and an improvement in the performance of the downstream segmentation model by $\approx 5\%$ when trained with denoised labels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transferable and Forecastable User Targeting Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12468v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User targeting, the process of selecting targeted users from a pool of candidates for non-expert marketers, has garnered substantial attention with the advancements in digital marketing. However, existing user targeting methods encounter two significant challenges: (i) Poor cross-domain and cross-scenario transferability and generalization, and (ii) Insufficient forecastability in real-world applications. These limitations hinder their applicability across diverse industrial scenarios. In this work, we propose FIND, an industrial-grade, transferable, and forecastable user targeting foundation model. To enhance cross-domain transferability, our framework integrates heterogeneous multi-scenario user data, aligning them with one-sentence targeting demand inputs through contrastive pre-training. For improved forecastability, the text description of each user is derived based on anticipated future behaviors, while user representations are constructed from historical information. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing baselines in cross-domain, real-world user targeting scenarios, showcasing the superior capabilities of FIND. Moreover, our method has been successfully deployed on the Alipay platform and is widely utilized across various scenarios.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

Previous works on interpretability for machine learning models on pathology images have revolved around methods such as attention value visualization and deriving human-interpretable features from model heatmaps. Mechanistic interpretability is an emerging area of model interpretability that focuses on reverse-engineering neural networks. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising direction in terms of extracting monosemantic features from polysemantic model activations. In this work, we trained a Sparse Autoencoder on the embeddings of a pathology pretrained foundation model. We found that Sparse Autoencoder features represent interpretable and monosemantic biological concepts. In particular, individual SAE dimensions showed strong correlations with cell type counts such as plasma cells and lymphocytes. These biological representations were unique to the pathology pretrained model and were not found in a self-supervised model pretrained on natural images. We demonstrated that such biologically-grounded monosemantic representations evolved across the model's depth, and the pathology foundation model eventually gained robustness to non-biological factors such as scanner type. The emergence of biologically relevant SAE features was generalizable to an out-of-domain dataset. Our work paves the way for further exploration around interpretable feature dimensions and their utility for medical and clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

Previous research has primarily focused on separately training patch-level and whole-slide image (WSI)-level models, limiting the integration of learned knowledge across patches and WSIs, and resulting in redundant models. In this work, we introduce CPath-Omni, the first 15-billion-parameter LMM designed to unify both patch and WSI level image analysis, consolidating a variety of tasks at both levels, including classification, visual question answering, captioning, and visual referring prompting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPath-Omni achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across seven diverse tasks on 39 out of 42 datasets, outperforming or matching task-specific models trained for individual tasks. Additionally, we develop a specialized pathology CLIP-based visual processor for CPath-Omni, CPath-CLIP, which, for the first time, integrates different vision models and incorporates a large language model as a text encoder to build a more powerful CLIP model, which achieves SOTA performance on nine zero-shot and four few-shot datasets. Our findings highlight CPath-Omni's ability to unify diverse pathology tasks, demonstrating its potential to streamline and advance the field of foundation model in pathology.</p></details> | 22 pages, 13 figures |

To reduce the costs of these essential controls, this paper investigates the use of Speech Foundation Models (SFMs) to automate the validation process, examining for the first time the cost/quality trade-off in data acquisition. Experiments conducted on French, German, and Korean data demonstrate that SFM-based validation has the potential to reduce reliance on human validation, resulting in an estimated cost saving of over 40.0% without degrading final data quality. These findings open new opportunities for more efficient, cost-effective, and scalable speech data acquisition.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at COLING 2025 main conference</p></details> |

However, the invariance of these representations to patch rotation remains unexplored. This study investigates the rotational invariance of latent representations across twelve foundation models by quantifying the alignment between non-rotated and rotated patches using mutual $k$-nearest neighbours and cosine distance. Models that incorporated rotation augmentation during self-supervised training exhibited significantly greater invariance to rotations. We hypothesise that the absence of rotational inductive bias in the transformer architecture necessitates rotation augmentation during training to achieve learned invariance.

However, such solutions are not yet available for Tetun, making it challenging to find relevant documents for text-based search queries in this language. To address these challenges, this study investigates Tetun text retrieval with a focus on the ad-hoc retrieval task. It begins by developing essential language resources -- including a list of stopwords, a stemmer, and a test collection -- which serve as foundational components for solutions tailored to Tetun text retrieval. Various strategies are then explored using both document titles and content to evaluate retrieval effectiveness. The results show that retrieving document titles, after removing hyphens and apostrophes without applying stemming, significantly improves retrieval performance compared to the baseline. Efficiency increases by 31.37%, while effectiveness achieves an average gain of 9.40% in MAP@10 and 30.35% in nDCG@10 with DFR BM25. Beyond the top-10 cutoff point, Hiemstra LM demonstrates strong performance across various retrieval strategies and evaluation metrics. Contributions of this work include the development of Labadain-Stopwords (a list of 160 Tetun stopwords), Labadain-Stemmer (a Tetun stemmer with three variants), and Labadain-Avaliad\'or (a Tetun test collection containing 59 topics, 33,550 documents, and 5,900 qrels).</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Foundation Model-Agnostic Slide-Level Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13623v2)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning of pathology whole-slide images(WSIs) has primarily relied on weak supervision with Multiple Instance Learning (MIL). This approach leads to slide representations highly tailored to a specific clinical task. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has been successfully applied to train histopathology foundation models (FMs) for patch embedding generation. However, generating patient or slide level embeddings remains challenging. Existing approaches for slide representation learning extend the principles of SSL from patch level learning to entire slides by aligning different augmentations of the slide or by utilizing multimodal data. By integrating tile embeddings from multiple FMs, we propose a new single modality SSL method in feature space that generates useful slide representations. Our contrastive pretraining strategy, called COBRA, employs multiple FMs and an architecture based on Mamba-2. COBRA exceeds performance of state-of-the-art slide encoders on four different public Clinical Protemic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) cohorts on average by at least +4.5% AUC, despite only being pretrained on 3048 WSIs from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Additionally, COBRA is readily compatible at inference time with previously unseen feature extractors. Code available at https://github.com/KatherLab/COBRA.</p></details> |  |

Benchmarking Foundation Models Against End-to-End Training for Mitotic Figure Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06365v2)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs), i.e., models trained on a vast amount of typically unlabeled data, have become popular and available recently for the domain of histopathology. The key idea is to extract semantically rich vectors from any input patch, allowing for the use of simple subsequent classification networks potentially reducing the required amounts of labeled data, and increasing domain robustness. In this work, we investigate to which degree this also holds for mitotic figure classification. Utilizing two popular public mitotic figure datasets, we compared linear probing of five publicly available FMs against models trained on ImageNet and a simple ResNet50 end-to-end-trained baseline. We found that the end-to-end-trained baseline outperformed all FM-based classifiers, regardless of the amount of data provided. Additionally, we did not observe the FM-based classifiers to be more robust against domain shifts, rendering both of the above assumptions incorrect.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |

However, most traditional deep learning predictors rely solely on unimodal numerical data, using a fixed-length window for training and prediction on a single dataset, and cannot adapt to different scenarios. The powered pre-trained large language model has introduced new opportunities for time series analysis. Yet, existing methods are either inefficient in training, incapable of handling textual information, or lack zero-shot forecasting capability. In this paper, we innovatively model time series as a foreign language and construct ChatTime, a unified framework for time series and text processing. As an out-of-the-box multimodal time series foundation model, ChatTime provides zero-shot forecasting capability and supports bimodal input/output for both time series and text. We design a series of experiments to verify the superior performance of ChatTime across multiple tasks and scenarios, and create four multimodal datasets to address data gaps. The experimental results demonstrate the potential and utility of ChatTime.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Existing models often struggle to detect gait bouts in individuals with neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) involving involuntary movements. We developed J-Net, a deep learning model inspired by U-Net, which uses a pre-trained self-supervised foundation model fine-tuned with Huntington`s disease (HD) in-lab data and paired with a segmentation head for gait detection. J-Net processes wrist-worn accelerometer data to detect gait during daily living. We evaluated J-Net on in-lab and daily-living data from HD, Parkinson`s disease (PD), and controls. J-Net achieved a 10-percentage point improvement in ROC-AUC for HD over existing methods, reaching 0.97 for in-lab data. In daily-living environments, J-Net estimates showed no significant differences in median daily walking time between HD and controls (p = 0.23), in contrast to other models, which indicated counterintuitive results (p < 0.005). Walking time measured by J-Net correlated with the UHDRS-TMS clinical severity score (r=-0.52; p=0.02), confirming its clinical relevance. Fine-tuning J-Net on PD data also improved gait detection over current methods. J-Net`s architecture effectively addresses the challenges of gait detection in severe chorea and offers robust performance in daily living. The dataset and J-Net model are publicly available, providing a resource for further research into NDD-related gait impairments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wearable Accelerometer Foundation Models for Health via Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11276v1)** | 2024-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern wearable devices can conveniently and continuously record various biosignals in the many different environments of daily living, ultimately enabling a rich view of individual health. However, not all biosignals are the same: high-fidelity measurements, such as photoplethysmography (PPG), contain more physiological information, but require optical sensors with a high power footprint. In a resource-constrained setting, such biosignals may be unavailable. Alternatively, a lower-fidelity biosignal, such as accelerometry that captures minute cardiovascular information during low-motion periods, has a significantly smaller power footprint and is available in almost any wearable device. Here, we demonstrate that we can distill representational knowledge across biosignals, i.e., from PPG to accelerometry, using 20 million minutes of unlabeled data, collected from ~172K participants in the Apple Heart and Movement Study under informed consent. We first pre-train PPG encoders via self-supervised learning, and then distill their representational knowledge to accelerometry encoders. We demonstrate strong cross-modal alignment on unseen data, e.g., 99.2% top-1 accuracy for retrieving PPG embeddings from accelerometry embeddings. We show that distilled accelerometry encoders have significantly more informative representations compared to self-supervised or supervised encoders trained directly on accelerometry data, observed by at least 23%-49% improved performance for predicting heart rate and heart rate variability. We also show that distilled accelerometry encoders are readily predictive of a wide array of downstream health targets, i.e., they are generalist foundation models. We believe accelerometry foundation models for health may unlock new opportunities for developing digital biomarkers from any wearable device, and help individuals track their health more frequently and conveniently.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods usually employ neural radiance fields to produce voxelized 3D occupancy, lacking instance-level semantic reasoning and temporal photometric consistency. In this paper, we propose ViPOcc, which leverages the visual priors from vision foundation models (VFMs) for fine-grained 3D occupancy prediction. Unlike previous works that solely employ volume rendering for RGB and depth image reconstruction, we introduce a metric depth estimation branch, in which an inverse depth alignment module is proposed to bridge the domain gap in depth distribution between VFM predictions and the ground truth. The recovered metric depth is then utilized in temporal photometric alignment and spatial geometric alignment to ensure accurate and consistent 3D occupancy prediction. Additionally, we also propose a semantic-guided non-overlapping Gaussian mixture sampler for efficient, instance-aware ray sampling, which addresses the redundant and imbalanced sampling issue that still exists in previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of ViPOcc in both 3D occupancy prediction and depth estimation tasks on the KITTI-360 and KITTI Raw datasets.

Leveraging the zero-shot capabilities of foundation models offers a promising solution to these challenges. In this paper, we introduce ZeroReg, a zero-shot registration approach that utilizes 2D foundation models to predict 3D correspondences. Specifically, ZeroReg adopts an object-to-point matching strategy, starting with object localization and semantic feature extraction from multi-view images using foundation models. In the object matching stage, semantic features help identify correspondences between objects across views. However, relying solely on semantic features can lead to ambiguity, especially in scenes with multiple instances of the same category. To address this, we construct scene graphs to capture spatial relationships among objects and apply a graph matching algorithm to these graphs to accurately identify matched objects. Finally, computing fine-grained point-level correspondences within matched object regions using algorithms like SuperGlue and LoFTR achieves robust point cloud registration. Evaluations on benchmarks such as 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch, and ScanNet demonstrate ZeroReg's competitive performance, highlighting its potential to advance point-cloud registration by integrating semantic features from foundation models.</p></details> |  |

Recent research has increasingly focused on the explicit extraction of 3D features, while still facing challenges such as the lack of large-scale robotic 3D data and the potential loss of spatial geometry. To address these limitations, we propose the Lift3D framework, which progressively enhances 2D foundation models with implicit and explicit 3D robotic representations to construct a robust 3D manipulation policy. Specifically, we first design a task-aware masked autoencoder that masks task-relevant affordance patches and reconstructs depth information, enhancing the 2D foundation model's implicit 3D robotic representation. After self-supervised fine-tuning, we introduce a 2D model-lifting strategy that establishes a positional mapping between the input 3D points and the positional embeddings of the 2D model. Based on the mapping, Lift3D utilizes the 2D foundation model to directly encode point cloud data, leveraging large-scale pretrained knowledge to construct explicit 3D robotic representations while minimizing spatial information loss. In experiments, Lift3D consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods across several simulation benchmarks and real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present SMARTFEAT, an efficient automated feature engineering tool to assist data users, even non-experts, in constructing useful features. Leveraging the power of Foundation Models (FMs), our approach enables the creation of new features from the data, based on contextual information and open-world knowledge. Our method incorporates an intelligent operator selector that discerns a subset of operators, effectively avoiding exhaustive combinations of original features, as is typically observed in traditional automated feature engineering tools. Moreover, we address the limitations of performing data tasks through row-level interactions with FMs, which could lead to significant delays and costs due to excessive API calls. We introduce a function generator that facilitates the acquisition of efficient data transformations, such as dataframe built-in methods or lambda functions, ensuring the applicability of SMARTFEAT to generate new features for large datasets.

Existing FMs have struggled to establish sequence-structure alignment, hindering the free flow of genomic information between RNA sequences and structures. In this study, we introduce OmniGenome, an RNA FM trained to align RNA sequences with respect to secondary structures based on structure-contextualised modelling. The alignment enables free and bidirectional mappings between sequences and structures by utilising the flexible RNA modelling paradigm that supports versatile input and output modalities, i.e., sequence and/or structure as input/output. We implement RNA design and zero-shot secondary structure prediction as case studies to evaluate the Seq2Str and Str2Seq mapping capacity of OmniGenome. Results on the EternaV2 benchmark show that OmniGenome solved 74% of puzzles, whereas existing FMs only solved up to 3% of the puzzles due to the oversight of sequence-structure alignment. We leverage four comprehensive in-silico genome modelling benchmarks to evaluate performance across a diverse set of genome downstream tasks, where the results show that OmniGenome achieves state-of-the-art performance on RNA and DNA benchmarks, even without any training on DNA genomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

While recent iterative optimization-based methods have achieved promising performance, their feature extraction capabilities still have room for improvement. Inspired by the ability of vision foundation models (VFMs) to extract general representations, in this work, we propose AIO-Stereo which can flexibly select and transfer knowledge from multiple heterogeneous VFMs to a single stereo matching model. To better reconcile features between heterogeneous VFMs and the stereo matching model and fully exploit prior knowledge from VFMs, we proposed a dual-level feature utilization mechanism that aligns heterogeneous features and transfers multi-level knowledge. Based on the mechanism, a dual-level selective knowledge transfer module is designed to selectively transfer knowledge and integrate the advantages of multiple VFMs. Experimental results show that AIO-Stereo achieves start-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets and ranks $1^{st}$ on the Middlebury dataset and outperforms all the published work on the ETH3D benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

However, FRS faces inherent limitations such as data heterogeneity and scarcity, due to the privacy requirements of FL and the typical data sparsity issues of RSs. Models like ChatGPT are empowered by the concept of transfer learning and self-supervised learning, so they can be easily applied to the downstream tasks after fine-tuning or prompting. These models, so-called Foundation Models (FM), fouce on understanding the human's intent and perform following their designed roles in the specific tasks, which are widely recognized for producing high-quality content in the image and language domains. Thus, the achievements of FMs inspire the design of FRS and suggest a promising research direction: integrating foundation models to address the above limitations. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive review of FRSs with FMs. Specifically, we: 1) summarise the common approaches of current FRSs and FMs; 2) review the challenges posed by FRSs and FMs; 3) discuss potential future research directions; and 4) introduce some common benchmarks and evaluation metrics in the FRS field.

We begin by outlining the characteristics of THz UM-MIMO systems, and identify three primary challenges for the transceiver design: 'hard to compute', 'hard to model', and 'hard to measure'. We argue that AI can provide a promising solution to these challenges. We then propose two systematic research roadmaps for developing AI algorithms tailored for THz UM-MIMO systems. The first roadmap, called model-driven deep learning (DL), emphasizes the importance to leverage available domain knowledge and advocates for adopting AI only to enhance the bottleneck modules within an established signal processing or optimization framework. We discuss four essential steps to make it work, including algorithmic frameworks, basis algorithms, loss function design, and neural architecture design. Afterwards, we present a forward-looking vision through the second roadmap, i.e., physical layer foundation models. This approach seeks to unify the design of different transceiver modules by focusing on their common foundation, i.e., the wireless channel. We propose to train a single, compact foundation model to estimate the score function of wireless channels, which can serve as a versatile prior for designing a wide variety of transceiver modules. We will also guide the readers through four essential steps, including general frameworks, conditioning, site-specific adaptation, and the joint design of foundation models and model-driven DL.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 8 figures, tutorial paper.

More recently, these workflows have been significantly augmented with the advent of large language models (LLMs) and systems of autonomous agents capable of utilizing pre-trained models to make predictions in the context of more complex research tasks. While effective, there is still room for substantial improvement within agentic systems on the retrieval of salient information for material design tasks. Within this context, alternative uses of predictive deep learning models, such as leveraging their latent representations to facilitate cross-modal retrieval augmented generation within agentic systems for task-specific materials design, has remained unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate that large, pre-trained chemistry foundation models can serve as a basis for enabling structure-focused, semantic chemistry information retrieval for both small-molecules, complex polymeric materials, and reactions. Additionally, we show the use of chemistry foundation models in conjunction with multi-modal models such as OpenCLIP facilitate unprecedented queries and information retrieval across multiple characterization data domains. Finally, we demonstrate the integration of these models within multi-agent systems to facilitate structure and topological-based natural language queries and information retrieval for different research tasks.</p></details> |  |

As a result, FM leaderboards have become essential tools for SE teams to compare and select the best third-party FMs for their specific products and purposes. However, the lack of standardized guidelines for FM evaluation and comparison threatens the transparency of FM leaderboards and limits stakeholders' ability to perform effective FM selection. As a first step towards addressing this challenge, our research focuses on understanding how these FM leaderboards operate in real-world scenarios ("leaderboard operations") and identifying potential pitfalls and areas for improvement ("leaderboard smells"). In this regard, we collect up to 1,045 FM leaderboards from five different sources: GitHub, Hugging Face Spaces, Papers With Code, spreadsheet and independent platform, to examine their documentation and engage in direct communication with leaderboard operators to understand their workflows. Through card sorting and negotiated agreement, we identify five distinct workflow patterns and develop a domain model that captures the key components and their interactions within these workflows. We then identify eight unique types of leaderboard smells in LBOps. By mitigating these smells, SE teams can improve transparency, accountability, and collaboration in current LBOps practices, fostering a more robust and responsible ecosystem for FM comparison and selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>aweso...</summary><p>awesome foundation model leaderboard list: https://github.com/SAILResearch/awesome-foundation-model-leaderboards</p></details> |

Wearable sensing data, on the other hand, contain more variability in both patterns and frequency bands of interest and generally emphasize more on the ability to infer healthcare-related outcomes. The main challenge of crafting a foundation model for wearable sensing physiological signals is to learn generalizable representations that support efficient adaptation across heterogeneous sensing configurations and applications. In this work, we propose NormWear, a step toward such a foundation model, aiming to extract generalized and informative wearable sensing representations. NormWear has been pretrained on a large set of physiological signals, including PPG, ECG, EEG, GSR, and IMU, from various public resources. For a holistic assessment, we perform downstream evaluation on 11 public wearable sensing datasets, spanning 18 applications in the areas of mental health, body state inference, biomarker estimations, and disease risk evaluations. We demonstrate that NormWear achieves a better performance improvement over competitive baselines in general time series foundation modeling. In addition, leveraging a novel representation-alignment-match-based method, we align physiological signals embeddings with text embeddings. This alignment enables our proposed foundation model to perform zero-shot inference, allowing it to generalize to previously unseen wearable signal-based health applications. Finally, we perform nonlinear dynamic analysis on the waveform features extracted by the model at each intermediate layer. This analysis quantifies the model's internal processes, offering clear insights into its behavior and fostering greater trust in its inferences among end users.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at: http://github.com/Mobile-Sensing-and-UbiComp-Laboratory/NormWear</p></details> |

With the differences in architecture and training protocols (i.e., objectives, proxy tasks), a unified framework to fairly and comprehensively probe their 3D awareness is urgently needed. Existing works on 3D probing suggest single-view 2.5D estimation (e.g., depth and normal) or two-view sparse 2D correspondence (e.g., matching and tracking). Unfortunately, these tasks ignore texture awareness, and require 3D data as ground-truth, which limits the scale and diversity of their evaluation set. To address these issues, we introduce Feat2GS, which readout 3D Gaussians attributes from VFM features extracted from unposed images. This allows us to probe 3D awareness for geometry and texture via novel view synthesis, without requiring 3D data. Additionally, the disentanglement of 3DGS parameters - geometry ($\boldsymbol{x}, \alpha, \Sigma$) and texture ($\boldsymbol{c}$) - enables separate analysis of texture and geometry awareness. Under Feat2GS, we conduct extensive experiments to probe the 3D awareness of several VFMs, and investigate the ingredients that lead to a 3D aware VFM. Building on these findings, we develop several variants that achieve state-of-the-art across diverse datasets. This makes Feat2GS useful for probing VFMs, and as a simple-yet-effective baseline for novel-view synthesis. Code and data will be made available at https://fanegg.github.io/Feat2GS/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://fanegg.github.io/Feat2GS/</p></details> |
| **[Foundational Large Language Models for Materials Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09560v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Materials discovery and development are critical for addressing global challenges. Yet, the exponential growth in materials science literature comprising vast amounts of textual data has created significant bottlenecks in knowledge extraction, synthesis, and scientific reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to accelerate materials research through automated analysis and prediction. Still, their effective deployment requires domain-specific adaptation for understanding and solving domain-relevant tasks. Here, we present LLaMat, a family of foundational models for materials science developed through continued pretraining of LLaMA models on an extensive corpus of materials literature and crystallographic data. Through systematic evaluation, we demonstrate that LLaMat excels in materials-specific NLP and structured information extraction while maintaining general linguistic capabilities. The specialized LLaMat-CIF variant demonstrates unprecedented capabilities in crystal structure generation, predicting stable crystals with high coverage across the periodic table. Intriguingly, despite LLaMA-3's superior performance in comparison to LLaMA-2, we observe that LLaMat-2 demonstrates unexpectedly enhanced domain-specific performance across diverse materials science tasks, including structured information extraction from text and tables, more particularly in crystal structure generation, a potential adaptation rigidity in overtrained LLMs. Altogether, the present work demonstrates the effectiveness of domain adaptation towards developing practically deployable LLM copilots for materials research. Beyond materials science, our findings reveal important considerations for domain adaptation of LLMs, such as model selection, training methodology, and domain-specific performance, which may influence the development of specialized scientific AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Medical Foundation Model Features in Graph Neural Network-Based Retrieval of Breast Histopathology Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04211v3)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Breast cancer is the most common cancer type in women worldwide. Early detection and appropriate treatment can significantly reduce its impact. While histopathology examinations play a vital role in rapid and accurate diagnosis, they often require experienced medical experts for proper recognition and cancer grading. Automated image retrieval systems have the potential to assist pathologists in identifying cancerous tissues, thereby accelerating the diagnostic process. Nevertheless, proposing an accurate image retrieval model is challenging due to considerable variability among the tissue and cell patterns in histological images. In this work, we leverage the features from foundation models in a novel attention-based adversarially regularized variational graph autoencoder model for breast histological image retrieval. Our results confirm the superior performance of models trained with foundation model features compared to those using pre-trained convolutional neural networks (up to 7.7% and 15.5% for mAP and mMV, respectively), with the pre-trained general-purpose self-supervised model for computational pathology (UNI) delivering the best overall performance. By evaluating two publicly available histology image datasets of breast cancer, our top-performing model, trained with UNI features, achieved average mAP/mMV scores of 96.7%/91.5% and 97.6%/94.2% for the BreakHis and BACH datasets, respectively. Our proposed retrieval model has the potential to be used in clinical settings to enhance diagnostic performance and ultimately benefit patients.</p></details> | 29 pages |

However, existing AI4SI research is often labor-intensive and resource-demanding, limiting its accessibility and scalability; the standard approach is to design a (base-level) system tailored to a specific AI4SI problem. We propose the development of a novel meta-level multi-agent system designed to accelerate the development of such base-level systems, thereby reducing the computational cost and the burden on social impact domain experts and AI researchers. Leveraging advancements in foundation models and large language models, our proposed approach focuses on resource allocation problems providing help across the full AI4SI pipeline from problem formulation over solution design to impact evaluation. We highlight the ethical considerations and challenges inherent in deploying such systems and emphasize the importance of a human-in-the-loop approach to ensure the responsible and effective application of AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pinpoint Counterfactuals: Reducing social bias in foundation models via localized counterfactual generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09160v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models trained on web-scraped datasets propagate societal biases to downstream tasks. While counterfactual generation enables bias analysis, existing methods introduce artifacts by modifying contextual elements like clothing and background. We present a localized counterfactual generation method that preserves image context by constraining counterfactual modifications to specific attribute-relevant regions through automated masking and guided inpainting. When applied to the Conceptual Captions dataset for creating gender counterfactuals, our method results in higher visual and semantic fidelity than state-of-the-art alternatives, while maintaining the performance of models trained using only real data on non-human-centric tasks. Models fine-tuned with our counterfactuals demonstrate measurable bias reduction across multiple metrics, including a decrease in gender classification disparity and balanced person preference scores, while preserving ImageNet zero-shot performance. The results establish a framework for creating balanced datasets that enable both accurate bias profiling and effective mitigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Foundation Models on Heterogeneous Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08906v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training a general-purpose time series foundation models with robust generalization capabilities across diverse applications from scratch is still an open challenge. Efforts are primarily focused on fusing cross-domain time series datasets to extract shared subsequences as tokens for training models on Transformer architecture. However, due to significant statistical heterogeneity across domains, this cross-domain fusing approach doesn't work effectively as the same as fusing texts and images. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a novel federated learning approach to address the heterogeneity in time series foundation models training, namely FFTS. Specifically, each data-holding organization is treated as an independent client in a collaborative learning framework with federated settings, and then many client-specific local models will be trained to preserve the unique characteristics per dataset. Moreover, a new regularization mechanism will be applied to both client-side and server-side, thus to align the shared knowledge across heterogeneous datasets from different domains. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed federated learning approach. The newly learned time series foundation models achieve superior generalization capabilities on cross-domain time series analysis tasks, including forecasting, imputation, and anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Main Track in AAAI'25</p></details> |
| **[Domain-Adaptive Pre-training of Self-Supervised Foundation Models for Medical Image Classification in Gastrointestinal Endoscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21302v4)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video capsule endoscopy has transformed gastrointestinal endoscopy (GIE) diagnostics by offering a non-invasive method for capturing detailed images of the gastrointestinal tract, enabling early disease detection. However, its potential is limited by the sheer volume of images generated during the imaging procedure, which can take anywhere from 6-8 hours and often produce up to 1 million images, necessitating automated analysis. Additionally, the variability of these images, combined with the need for expert annotations and the scarcity of large, high-quality labeled datasets, constrains the effectiveness of current medical image analysis models. To address this, we introduce a novel large GIE dataset, called EndoExtend24, created by merging ten existing public and private datasets, ensuring patient integrity across splits. EndoExtend24 includes over 226,000 labeled images, as well as dynamic class mappings, which allow unified training across datasets with differing labeling granularity, supporting up to 123 distinct pathological findings. Further, we propose to leverage domain adaptive pre-training of foundation models trained with self-supervision on generic image data, to adapt them to the task of GIE medical image diagnosis. Specifically, the EVA-02 model, which is based on the ViT architecture and trained on ImageNet-22k with masked image modeling (using EVA-CLIP as a MIM teacher), is pre-trained on the EndoExtend24 dataset to achieve domain adaptation, and finally trained on the Capsule Endoscopy 2024 Challenge dataset. Our model demonstrates robust performance, securing third place in the Capsule Endoscopy 2024 Challenge. We achieved a macro AUC of 0.762 and a balanced accuracy of 37.1% on the test set. These results emphasize the effectiveness of our domain-adaptive pre-training approach and the enriched EndoExtend24 dataset in advancing gastrointestinal endoscopy diagnostics.</p></details> |  |
| **[MicroScopiQ: Accelerating Foundational Models through Outlier-Aware Microscaling Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05282v3)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantization of foundational models (FMs) is significantly more challenging than traditional DNNs due to the emergence of large magnitude features called outliers. Existing outlier-aware algorithm/architecture co-design techniques either use mixed-precision, retaining outliers at high precision but compromise hardware efficiency, or quantize inliers and outliers at the same precision, improving hardware efficiency at the cost of accuracy. To address this mutual exclusivity, in this paper, we propose MicroScopiQ, a novel co-design technique that leverages pruning to complement outlier-aware quantization. MicroScopiQ retains outliers at higher precision while pruning a certain fraction of least important weights to distribute the additional outlier bits; ensuring high accuracy, aligned memory and hardware efficiency. We design a high-throughput, low overhead accelerator architecture composed of simple multi-precision INT processing elements and a novel network-on-chip called ReCoN that efficiently abstracts the complexity of supporting high-precision outliers. Additionally, unlike existing alternatives, MicroScopiQ does not assume any locality of outlier weights, enabling applicability to a broad range of FMs. Extensive experiments across various quantization settings show that MicroScopiQ achieves SoTA quantization performance while simultaneously improving inference performance by 3x and reducing energy by 2x over existing alternatives.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint under review</p></details> |

| **[LoRA3D: Low-Rank Self-Calibration of 3D Geometric Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07746v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emerging 3D geometric foundation models, such as DUSt3R, offer a promising approach for in-the-wild 3D vision tasks. However, due to the high-dimensional nature of the problem space and scarcity of high-quality 3D data, these pre-trained models still struggle to generalize to many challenging circumstances, such as limited view overlap or low lighting. To address this, we propose LoRA3D, an efficient self-calibration pipeline to $\textit{specialize}$ the pre-trained models to target scenes using their own multi-view predictions. Taking sparse RGB images as input, we leverage robust optimization techniques to refine multi-view predictions and align them into a global coordinate frame. In particular, we incorporate prediction confidence into the geometric optimization process, automatically re-weighting the confidence to better reflect point estimation accuracy. We use the calibrated confidence to generate high-quality pseudo labels for the calibrating views and use low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the models on the pseudo-labeled data. Our method does not require any external priors or manual labels. It completes the self-calibration process on a $\textbf{single standard GPU within just 5 minutes}$. Each low-rank adapter requires only $\textbf{18MB}$ of storage. We evaluated our method on $\textbf{more than 160 scenes}$ from the Replica, TUM and Waymo Open datasets, achieving up to $\textbf{88% performance improvement}$ on 3D reconstruction, multi-view pose estimation and novel-view rendering.</p></details> |  |
| **[RADIO Amplified: Improved Baselines for Agglomerative Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07679v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agglomerative models have recently emerged as a powerful approach to training vision foundation models, leveraging multi-teacher distillation from existing models such as CLIP, DINO, and SAM. This strategy enables the efficient creation of robust models, combining the strengths of individual teachers while significantly reducing computational and resource demands. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze state-of-the-art agglomerative models, identifying critical challenges including resolution mode shifts, teacher imbalance, idiosyncratic teacher artifacts, and an excessive number of output tokens. To address these issues, we propose several novel solutions: multi-resolution training, mosaic augmentation, and improved balancing of teacher loss functions. Specifically, in the context of Vision Language Models, we introduce a token compression technique to maintain high-resolution information within a fixed token count. We release our top-performing models, available in multiple scales (-B, -L, -H, and -g), alongside inference code and pretrained weights.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Graph Foundation Models: A Study on the Generalization of Positional and Structural Encodings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07407v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in integrating positional and structural encodings (PSEs) into graph neural networks (GNNs) have significantly enhanced their performance across various graph learning tasks. However, the general applicability of these encodings and their potential to serve as foundational representations for graphs remain uncertain. This paper investigates the fine-tuning efficiency, scalability with sample size, and generalization capability of learnable PSEs across diverse graph datasets. Specifically, we evaluate their potential as universal pre-trained models that can be easily adapted to new tasks with minimal fine-tuning and limited data. Furthermore, we assess the expressivity of the learned representations, particularly, when used to augment downstream GNNs. We demonstrate through extensive benchmarking and empirical analysis that PSEs generally enhance downstream models. However, some datasets may require specific PSE-augmentations to achieve optimal performance. Nevertheless, our findings highlight their significant potential to become integral components of future graph foundation models. We provide new insights into the strengths and limitations of PSEs, contributing to the broader discourse on foundation models in graph learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy in Foundation Models: A Conceptual Framework for System Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06998v2)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI and its relevant technologies, including machine learning, deep learning, chatbots, virtual assistants, and others, are currently undergoing a profound transformation of development and organizational processes within companies. Foundation models present both significant challenges and incredible opportunities. In this context, ensuring the quality attributes of foundation model-based systems is of paramount importance, and with a particular focus on the challenging issue of privacy due to the sensitive nature of the data and information involved. However, there is currently a lack of consensus regarding the comprehensive scope of both technical and non-technical issues that the privacy evaluation process should encompass. Additionally, there is uncertainty about which existing methods are best suited to effectively address these privacy concerns. In response to this challenge, this paper introduces a novel conceptual framework that integrates various responsible AI patterns from multiple perspectives, with the specific aim of safeguarding privacy.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[CBraMod: A Criss-Cross Brain Foundation Model for EEG Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07236v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique to measure and record brain electrical activity, widely used in various BCI and healthcare applications. Early EEG decoding methods rely on supervised learning, limited by specific tasks and datasets, hindering model performance and generalizability. With the success of large language models, there is a growing body of studies focusing on EEG foundation models. However, these studies still leave challenges: Firstly, most of existing EEG foundation models employ full EEG modeling strategy. It models the spatial and temporal dependencies between all EEG patches together, but ignores that the spatial and temporal dependencies are heterogeneous due to the unique structural characteristics of EEG signals. Secondly, existing EEG foundation models have limited generalizability on a wide range of downstream BCI tasks due to varying formats of EEG data, making it challenging to adapt to. To address these challenges, we propose a novel foundation model called CBraMod. Specifically, we devise a criss-cross transformer as the backbone to thoroughly leverage the structural characteristics of EEG signals, which can model spatial and temporal dependencies separately through two parallel attention mechanisms. And we utilize an asymmetric conditional positional encoding scheme which can encode positional information of EEG patches and be easily adapted to the EEG with diverse formats. CBraMod is pre-trained on a very large corpus of EEG through patch-based masked EEG reconstruction. We evaluate CBraMod on up to 10 downstream BCI tasks (12 public datasets). CBraMod achieves the state-of-the-art performance across the wide range of tasks, proving its strong capability and generalizability.

| **[UniAudio: An Audio Foundation Model Toward Universal Audio Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00704v6)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language models (LLM) have demonstrated the capability to handle a variety of generative tasks. This paper presents the UniAudio system, which, unlike prior task-specific approaches, leverages LLM techniques to generate multiple types of audio (including speech, sounds, music, and singing) with given input conditions. UniAudio 1) first tokenizes all types of target audio along with other condition modalities, 2) concatenates source-target pair as a single sequence, and 3) performs next-token prediction using LLM. Also, a multi-scale Transformer model is proposed to handle the overly long sequences caused by the residual vector quantization based neural codec in tokenization. Training of UniAudio is scaled up to 165K hours of audio and 1B parameters, based on all generative tasks, aiming to obtain sufficient prior knowledge not only in the intrinsic properties of audio but also the inter-relationship between audio and other modalities. Therefore, the trained UniAudio model has the potential to become a foundation model for universal audio generation: it shows strong capability in all trained tasks and can seamlessly support new audio generation tasks after simple fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that UniAudio achieves state-of-the-art or at least competitive results on most of the 11 tasks. Demo and code are released at https://github.com/yangdongchao/UniAudio</p></details> |  |
| **[Semi-supervised 3D Semantic Scene Completion with 2D Vision Foundation Model Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11559v3)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of 3D semantic occupancy from 2D visual images is vital in enabling autonomous agents to comprehend their surroundings for planning and navigation. State-of-the-art methods typically employ fully supervised approaches, necessitating a huge labeled dataset acquired through expensive LiDAR sensors and meticulous voxel-wise labeling by human annotators. The resource-intensive nature of this annotating process significantly hampers the application and scalability of these methods. We introduce a novel semi-supervised framework to alleviate the dependency on densely annotated data. Our approach leverages 2D foundation models to generate essential 3D scene geometric and semantic cues, facilitating a more efficient training process. Our framework exhibits notable properties: (1) Generalizability, applicable to various 3D semantic scene completion approaches, including 2D-3D lifting and 3D-2D transformer methods. (2) Effectiveness, as demonstrated through experiments on SemanticKITTI and NYUv2, wherein our method achieves up to 85% of the fully-supervised performance using only 10% labeled data. This approach not only reduces the cost and labor associated with data annotation but also demonstrates the potential for broader adoption in camera-based systems for 3D semantic occupancy prediction.</p></details> | Accepted at AAAI2025 |

Why is it important? Because at the core of medicine, pharmacy, public health, longevity, agriculture and food security, environmental protection, and clean energy, it is biology at work. Biology in the physical world is too complex to manipulate and always expensive and risky to tamper with. In this perspective, we layout an engineering viable approach to address this challenge by constructing an AI-Driven Digital Organism (AIDO), a system of integrated multiscale foundation models, in a modular, connectable, and holistic fashion to reflect biological scales, connectedness, and complexities. An AIDO opens up a safe, affordable and high-throughput alternative platform for predicting, simulating and programming biology at all levels from molecules to cells to individuals. We envision that an AIDO is poised to trigger a new wave of better-guided wet-lab experimentation and better-informed first-principle reasoning, which can eventually help us better decode and improve life.</p></details> |  |

Towards that goal, it is important to understand the 3D reasoning capabilities of current models as well as identify the gaps between these models and humans. Therefore, we construct a new 3D visual understanding benchmark named UniQA-3D. UniQA-3D covers fundamental 3D vision tasks in the Visual Question Answering (VQA) format. We evaluate state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs), specialized models, and human subjects on it. Our results show that VLMs generally perform poorly, while the specialized models are accurate but not robust, failing under geometric perturbations. In contrast, human vision continues to be the most reliable 3D visual system. We further demonstrate that neural networks align more closely with human 3D vision mechanisms compared to classical computer vision methods, and Transformer-based networks such as ViT align more closely with human 3D vision mechanisms than CNNs. We hope our study will benefit the future development of foundation models for 3D vision.

To assess the information gathering abilities of foundation models in interactive environments, we introduce a framework in which a model must determine the factors influencing a hidden reward function by iteratively reasoning about its previously gathered information and proposing its next exploratory action to maximize information gain at each step. We implement this framework in both a text-based environment, which offers a tightly controlled setting and enables high-throughput parameter sweeps, and in an embodied 3D environment, which requires addressing complexities of multi-modal interaction more relevant to real-world applications. We further investigate whether approaches such as self-correction and increased inference time improve information gathering efficiency. In a relatively simple task that requires identifying a single rewarding feature, we find that LLM's information gathering capability is close to optimal. However, when the model must identify a conjunction of rewarding features, performance is suboptimal. The hit in performance is due partly to the model translating task description to a policy and partly to the model's effectiveness in using its in-context memory. Performance is comparable in both text and 3D embodied environments, although imperfect visual object recognition reduces its accuracy in drawing conclusions from gathered information in the 3D embodied case. For single-feature-based rewards, we find that smaller models curiously perform better; for conjunction-based rewards, incorporating self correction into the model improves performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measuring Pre-training Data Quality without Labels for Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06368v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there has been a growing interest in time series foundation models that generalize across different downstream tasks. A key to strong foundation models is a diverse pre-training dataset, which is particularly challenging to collect for time series classification. In this work, we explore the performance of a contrastive-learning-based foundation model as a function of the data used for pre-training. We introduce contrastive accuracy, a new measure to evaluate the quality of the representation space learned by the foundation model. Our experiments reveal the positive correlation between the proposed measure and the accuracy of the model on a collection of downstream tasks. This suggests that the contrastive accuracy can serve as a criterion to search for time series datasets that can enhance the pre-training and improve thereby the foundation model's generalization.</p></details> |  |
